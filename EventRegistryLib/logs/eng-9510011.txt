While he finished the regular season strong for the Milwaukee Bucks, putting together yet another MVP-like campaign, Giannis also finished the season on the sidelines due to a mysterious calf injury. Now, he finds himself attempting to work his way back onto the court for a potential return against the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nWhen this injury first occurred on April 9 against the Boston Celtics, there was a lot of concern surrounding Giannis' status because of the way he suffered his non-contact left calf injury. Fortunately, there was no Achilles damage, and the Bucks diagnosed Antetokounmpo with a left calf strain, specifically dealing with the soleus muscle. Two full weeks have gone by since Antetokounmpo suffered this injury, and the Bucks have given very little information on his whereabouts.\n\nAfter missing Game 1 against the Pacers, in which the Bucks defeated Indiana 109-94, Giannis ended up missing Game 2 on Tuesday night. The Bucks lost this game 125-108 on their home floor, surrendering home-court advantage to Indiana. With their first-round series all evened up at one game apiece, Antetokounmpo's status for the Bucks looms large over their championship hopes.\n\nHowever, Giannis' status for Game 3 on Friday once again seems to be in doubt, as the superstar forward hasn't taken the proper steps needed to get back to full speed.\n\nLatest on Giannis Antetokounmpo's potential return\n\nWhile the Bucks have remained optimistic that Giannis will be back for this first-round series against the Pacers, his injury status continues to become more and more doubtful by the day. Currently on a two-to-four week timeline for his recovery, Antetokounmpo's availability truly depends on his response to treatment.\n\nAt this point, Antetokounmpo has started to do some stationary jump shooting, but he hasn't worked on any cutting, scrimmaging, or all-out running quite yet, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania. Until he starts running and actually scrimmaging with the team, it is hard to envision a scenario in which the Bucks would throw Giannis out there on the court, regardless if it is a do-or-die scenario.\n\nAntetokounmpo has dealt with injuries to his left hamstring, his left Achilles, and now his left calf. They can't take any chances of bringing their superstar back too soon; otherwise, he could wind up being ruled out for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe Bucks need Antetokounmpo on the floor if they are to be championship contenders. Without him, Milwaukee has major holes on the defensive side of the court, an area in which the Pacers exposed the Bucks during their 17-point blowout win in Game 2 on Tuesday. At this point, there is not much else the Bucks can do other than continue their around-the-clock treatment and hope for the best.\n\nThere is still no telling as to when Giannis will be able to return from this injury, but it is at least a somewhat step in the right direction that he's starting to do some jump shooting. It is safe to assume that Antetokounmpo will once again be listed as doubtful to play for Game 3 on Friday night in Indianapolis unless a miracle happens over the next 48 hours.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_siegel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brett Siegel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soleus_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soleus muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/7329724891.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510011", "eventUri": "eng-9510011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-09", "textStart": 718, "textEnd": 725}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

Jump shot progress is being made, which is critical for his return, but the chances of that are low. The Bucks are cautious not to rush Antetokounmpo back, and are prepared to play without him.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks find themselves tied with the Indiana Pacers 1-1 in the first round of the NBA playoffs. But if they wish to win the round, they will have to do it without Giannis Antetokounmpo. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, Antetokounmpo is still not able to run or scrimmage.\n\n\"[Giannis is] still not much cutting, no scrimmaging, no all out running yet and those are all things natural progression that he's gonna need to have he's gonna come back from a calf injury. This is the same like we talked about Achilles, hamstring and now calf. They need to be cautious, they need to be careful.\" -Shams Charania\n\nAntetokounmpo has so far missed the first two games of the series against the Pacers. The Bucks did manage to take Game 1 by a score of 109-94, thanks to heroic efforts from sharpshooter Damian Lillard.\n\nBut Game 2 was a much bleaker result for Milwaukee, as they were blown out by a score of 125-108. It was known that Antetokounmpo did take shots on the floor during practice, before Game 2, which is a promising sign.\n\n\"[He] shot today, was on the floor a bunch. He's getting closer.\" -Doc Rivers prior to Game 2\n\nJump Shot Progress There has been some progress with Antetokounmpo's jump shot, which is crucial\n\nWith the calf injury, the primary benefactor for Antetokounmpo's return will be his jumping ability. This comes with the ability to jump shoot, something all NBA players must execute but Antetokounmpo in particular is known for his elite jump shot. According to Shams Charania, there is some progress on that front.\n\n\"The key for Giannis right now with this calf injury is starting to do some jumping on your shooting and I'm told he has at least started to do some stationary jump shooting and that was a big development for him...When they bring him back, he's got to go through the natural progressions. And I think that will start with the cutting and the scrimmaging and the running and the full throttle jumping on your jump shots.\" -Shams Charania\n\nThe update is discouraging, and it likely rules out any chances of Antetokounmpo returning in this series. The Bucks have already prepared for the worst in case he does not return this year, in which case they would have quite an uphill battle to climb.\n\nRushing His Return The Bucks seek not to rush Antetokounmpo's return\n\nEven if he does return, the Bucks want to ensure that he is not rushed. That could reaggravate the calf and injure him further, and not to mention, he would not be nearly as effective.\n\nBut perhaps he could return soon if the Bucks get desperate, as Giannis on the court operating at 50 percent is better than no Giannis on the court, at least in the Bucks' eyes.\n\n\"Game three is Friday. I think the fact that you haven't progressed to that, and we'll see if he does over the next two days, game three might be pushing it, game four on Sunday. But I think the Bucks have to be prepared to keep playing on without Giannis making sure he's 100% when he does make it back.\" -Shams Charania\n\nAntetokounmpo injured the calf on April 9, in a game against the Boston Celtics. It was a non-contact injury which saw Antetokounmpo grab his left calf and go down in pain.\n\nHe left for the locker room at that point and has not returned to the court since. The Bucks are 6-5 this season in games their superstar has missed.\n\nRelated OG Anunoby Needs To Do More than Just Defend in the Playoffs OG Anunoby is an elite defensive player.

Pascal Siakam stunned Fiserv Forum by dropping a playoff career-high 37 points against the Bucks, helping his team seize a 125-108 win. With the Bucks' centerpiece, Giannis Antetokounmpo, sidelined in the playoffs, the series could soon be over for Milwaukee as the Pacers head home with a tied series. Alongside other pundits and experts, TNT's Inside the NBA crew members Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley also did not look optimistic about the Bucks winning this series.\n\nShaq seemed to believe that since Indiana would play the next few games at home, their fast pace of play could be the biggest detriment for the Bucks without Giannis Antetokounmpo on the team. Shaq said,\n\n\"And we all know they play different at home than they are on the road. They're going to play with a much faster pace. And when the three-ball is falling and when Siakam is playing like that, they don't have a chance.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Charles Barkley doesn't believe in the Bucks' chances of beating the Pacers even with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Highlighting the Bucks' record against the Pacers this season, Barkley said,\n\n\"They [Indiana Pacers] beat'em [Milwaukee Bucks] four out of five with Giannis. And the only game they lost, Giannis scored 64. Without Giannis, I don't think they got any chance of beating those guys.\"\n\nThe Pacers' unusual dominance against the Bucks this season has been a predominant narrative throughout the year. Indiana's road game win in Milwaukee has once again brought up the narrative. And it's pretty clear that Shaq and Chuck has also bought into it.\n\nMilwaukee has been left shorthanded in the front court in this series with the huge absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Greek Freak has missed the last two games of the NBA regular season and the two postseason games due to a calf injury. Though Giannis' status for the remainder of the first round matchup remains uncertain, his extended absence could be detrimental for the Bucks' hopes for title contention.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo missed his fifth straight game after sitting out for Game 2 of the Bucks' opening-round matchup against the Indiana Pacers. On April 9, Antetokounmpo was seen struggling in the third quarter in the game against the Boston Celtics. Though the game resulted in an eventual victory for Milwaukee, Antetokounmpo had to head to the locker room during the game. An MRI scan later revealed the star player has picked a muscle strain injury.\n\nThis isn't the first time Giannis is dealing with injuries in the postseason. Last year, Antetokounmpo missed Game 3 and 4 of their matchup against the Miami Heat, which resulted in a first-round exit for the Bucks.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddid_dey_purkayastha@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Siddid Dey Purkayastha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiserv Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/421f0fab-nba-2024-04-25t002717.242.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510011", "eventUri": "eng-9510011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-09", "textStart": 2254, "textEnd": 2261}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Unfortunately, according to the latest update, Giannis isn't due back for some time and he's not even at the stage of running or scrimmage in his recovery.\n\n\"I'm told [Giannis Antetokounmpo] has at least started to do some stationary jump shooting and that was a big development for him. But still not much cutting, no scrimmaging, no all-out running yet and those are all natural progressions that he will need to have. This is the same leg with issues on the Achilles, hamstring, and now calf. Game 3 might be pushing it but I think the Bucks have to be prepared to keep playing on without Giannis.\"\n\nThe Bucks came out on fire in Game 1 thanks to 35 first-half points from Damian Lillard. Even without Giannis, the Bucks were able to pull away as the Pacers struggled to adjust to the playoff atmosphere. In Game 2, Indiana responded in a big way by leaning on Pascal Siakam (who dropped 37 points) to lead the team to a blowout win. They looked much more settled in the second game, and it's likely how they'll be playing throughout the rest of the postseason.\n\nEven with Antetokounmpo, many experts and critics said an upset was plausible in this series and the play-in tournament proved that they match up well against the Bucks at full strength. So, without Giannis, it's no wonder why the Pacers are outright favored to advance and we saw on Tuesday how dangerous they can be when they've got it going offensively.\n\nThe only saving grace for the Bucks is that the next game isn't until Friday, giving Giannis at least two full days of rest and recovery before the team suits up again. As it stands, he's unlikely to play this week but with the season on the line, it would be surprising if he didn't at least try to take the floor before it's all said and done.\n\nThe Bucks Are In Trouble If They Lose In Round One\n\nWhile Milwuakee's injuries have given them a solid excuse for not going far this season, a first-round defeat in 2024 would mark the second straight year they've lost in the first round after finishing in the top three in the East. for a franchise with title aspirations, this is just unacceptable.\n\nGiannis is under contract through 2027 with an opt-out for the 2027-28 season but he can still force a move if he loses faith in their ability to win a championship. In a similar style to James Harden and his own Bucks teammate Damian Lillard, Giannis could demand a trade at any point if his frustration reaches a point beyond return.

One MRI scan later, and Antetokounmpo is set to miss his third straight playoff game against the Indiana Pacers with a left-calf strain.\n\nPrior to the Bucks' second home game, Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers addressed the obvious issue that Antetokounmpo's absence created -- that was, a need for Damian Lillard to shoot the lights out in order to build up a safe enough lead -- and delivered some positive news.\n\n\"(He) shot today,\" Rivers said. \"He was on the floor a bunch. He's getting closer.\"\n\nAfter the presser, Rivers made his way to the same spot his star forward would be for the duration of the game: the bench. Milwaukee played hard and Lillard once again delivered an electric 30-point performance, but this time, it wasn't enough to earn a win as the Pacers knotted the series at one game a piece.\n\nNow, both teams are heading to Indiana, but still, the Bucks will be without Giannis.\n\n\"I'm told [Giannis Antetokounmpo] has at least started to do some stationary jump shooting,\" The Athletic reporter Shams Charania reported. \"But still not much cutting. No scrimmaging. No all-out running yet.\"\n\nWithout Antetokounmpo, the Bucks have a much harder task on both ends of the court. With the level of rim-protecting and length he brings, slowing down one of the league's top offenses becomes an even more difficult challenge. With his offensive prowess missing, the burden falls ore heavily on Lillard and Khris Middleton. It just isn't an ideal situation to be in during the postseason.\n\nMilwaukee isn't using their star's absence as an excuse, but there's no doubt that both games of its series against Indiana would look different if Antetokounmpo had played -- though \"what ifs\" are trivial.\n\nAll the Bucks are focused on is playing well with what they have. If that's sans Antetokounmpo?\n\nSo be it.\n\n\"We're trying to win something that they want,\" Rivers explained of the \"personal\" nature of the NBA Playoffs. \"They're trying to win something that we want.

Plus, Tyrese Maxey's Most Improved Player award and the state of NBA officiating.\n\nA playoff series never truly begins in the NBA until the road team comes out on top. Through the first three days of playoff basketball, all of the home teams won, even though there were some very tight games that came down to the final possessions. Tuesday night's playoff action was slightly different, with the Indiana Pacers and Dallas Mavericks both picking up road wins over the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Clippers, respectively. In regards to the Pacers' win, even more questions are now being asked about Giannis Antetokounmpo's injury and his status for the NBA Playoffs.\n\nGiannis did not play in the Bucks' 109-94 Game 1 victory over the Pacers. He did not play in their 125-108 Game 2 defeat to the Pacers either. With this series knotted up at a game apiece and Antetokounmpo not progressing the way the Bucks imagined when the playoffs first began, there is certainly a sense of concern surrounding this organization. Internally, the Bucks still believe they will be able to advance with or without Giannis on the floor. However, the outside noise grows louder, especially after Milwaukee lost to the 8-seeded Miami Heat in the first round a season ago.\n\nOut of all the teams in the league, the Pacers had the biggest turnaround from Game 1 to Game 2 in their playoff series. After scoring a season-low 94 points while shooting 39.6 percent from the floor in their first game, Indiana bounced back to score 125 points while shooting 55.6 percent from the floor in Game 2. The Pacers are a very gifted offensive team, and that has been proven against Milwaukee this season, as Indiana has scored over 120 points in six of their seven matchups against the Bucks this year.\n\nWill the Pacers be able to sustain success as they take things to their home court with Antetokounmpo still sidelined? Over in the Western Conference, how does the Dallas Mavericks' win over the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 2 shape what could eventually become a seven-game series? All of this, plus the latest on the NBA awards races and some questionable officiating around the NBA in today's edition of the NBA Playoffs Primer.\n\nPacers, Mavericks shake things up\n\nWhen the NBA Playoffs began, many people circled the Pacers-Bucks and Mavericks-Clippers series as two matchups that had the chance to go the distance. Obviously, Giannis' injury plays a major factor in how things go in this first-round Eastern Conference series, and there is really no need to describe the Mavs versus the Clippers. A series that features six future Hall of Famers in Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Luka Doncic needs no introduction or reasoning as to why we should expect seven games.\n\nTo kick things off, we have to talk about the turnaround by Rick Carlisle and the Pacers from Game 1 to Game 2 in Milwaukee. Without Giannis on the floor, Damian Lillard has his way with the Pacers' defense, which has been one of the worst throughout the course of the season. Lillard scored 35 points in Game 1 and the Bucks simply got under the Pacers' skin, forcing 13 turnovers and not allowing Indiana to get going on the interior whatsoever.\n\nWhile Lillard another strong game with 34 points, the rest of the script was completely flipped in Game 2 on Tuesday night, with the Pacers taking the fight to the Bucks and not allowing Milwaukee to settle into sets on defense. Indiana looked faster and more determined than Milwaukee in this second game, which is why they seemed to be in control from the very opening tip. This series during the NBA Playoffs is now 10 times more interesting.\n\n\"They said they couldn't play defense, they did that in the second game. I thought it was more our offense versus their defense than the other way,\" Bucks head coach Doc Rivers said on Tuesday regarding the Pacers pulling away at the start of the fourth quarter. \"They got out on breaks because of our offense. I thought their pressure took us out of our sets, I thought we struggled execution-wise on the offensive end, and I thought that bled over into the defensive end. I thought it was more our offense tonight.\n\n\"So, even in that stretch, came out, ran a play that we liked, and we just didn't execute. So, we have got to handle that better.\"\n\nConstantly pressuring the Bucks and simply playing more as the aggressors in this series rather than letting the game come to them allowed the Pacers to build and sustain a lead, especially with their uptempo offense. Simply put, Game 2 came down to the Pacers playing their style of play and not letting the Bucks dictate how the game needed to be played. Without Giannis, the Bucks have looked identical through two games against Indiana. While things worked out in Game 1, we shouldn't expect much of the same so long as Indiana continues to play with high intensity.\n\nAs far as when Giannis could possibly return, this seems like the million-dollar question across the NBA right now. The Bucks have provided no clear timetable on when Antetokounmpo will resume full basketball activities, as he is truly day-to-day based on how his body responds to treatment. On Wednesday morning after Game 2, The Athletic's Shams Charania reported that the Bucks star has just started some light jump shooting, but he has not scrimmaged with the team nor resumed all-out running. It seems far-fetched to believe that Antetokounmpo will be 100 percent ready to play in Game 3.\n\nOver in the Western Conference, the Mavs picked up a big road win in Los Angeles to go back to Dallas with their series tied at 1-1. However, the Clippers simply lost Game 2 due to their poor shooting performance. Defensively, the Clippers have been really solid. Holding Luka Doncic to 11-of-26 from the floor in back-to-back games is definitely a win for Los Angeles, as is holding the Mavericks to 97 and 96 points in consecutive games during the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe key to this series doesn't involve the stars for either team. Instead, the focus of this series is on the interior. Winning the battle in the paint is going to be huge for either the Mavs or Clippers, especially when it comes to rebounding. In Game 1, it was Ivica Zubac and Terance Mann combining for 24 rebounds that really gave Los Angeles the advantage. In Game 2, Dallas had seven of their 10 players record at least six rebounds in what was a gang-rebounding effort. Dereck Lively II led the way off the bench with nine rebounds after Daniel Gafford left the game with a lower back injury.\n\nTyrese Maxey wins Most Improved Player\n\nThe first 2023-24 NBA award has been given out to Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey. The first-time All-Star took home the Most Improved Player award on Tuesday night, which shouldn't come as a shock to anyone. Maxey increased his scoring average from 20.3 points per game during the 2022-23 season to 25.9 points per game this season, and he was named an All-Star for the first time in his career.\n\nEach of the last five recipients of this award was named a first-time All-Star the same season. We might as well start calling this the First-Time All-Star award, right?\n\nThis ended up being a really close vote between Maxey and Chicago Bulls guard Coby White, who definitely improved more than the Sixers guard from a statistical and role standpoint. Whereas Maxey went from being the No. 3 guy in Philadelphia to Joel Embiid's right-hand man, White went from being a rotational player on the bench to becoming their second-most important player next to DeMar DeRozan.\n\nWhite jumped from 9.7 points per game during the 2022-23 season to 19.1 points per game this season, recording career-high marks in points, rebounds, assists, field goal percentage, and made threes.\n\nIn total, Maxey received 51 first-place votes for Most Improved Player compared to White's 32 first-place votes. Maxey won the vote with 319 points to White's 305 points.\n\nWhich awards are next?\n\nThe next award that will be given out will be the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award, which either Malik Monk or Naz Reid will be receiving on Wednesday night. Bobby Portis is also nominated for this award, but voters for the end-of-season awards were stuck between choosing Monk or Reid.\n\nMonk had a fantastic season, averaging 15.4 points per game in 72 games off the bench. He also led all players in bench scoring with 1,110 total points. Reid finished seventh on this list with 843 total points off the bench this season after averaging 13.5 points in 81 total games, 67 of which he came off the bench for.\n\nWhereas Monk and the Sacramento Kings missed the playoffs, Reid and the Timberwolves claimed the 3-seed in the NBA Playoffs with their second-best record in team history. That is where the dilemma is in terms of who should win this award: the best bench player in the league or one of the better bench players who played an instrumental role in helping his team achieve greatness.\n\nThe other two awards to be given out this week include the Clutch Player of the Year award, which will be handed out on Thursday, and the Coach of the Year award, which will almost certainly go to Oklahoma City Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault on Sunday. The NBA has yet to announce when the MVP, Rookie of the Year, and Defensive Player of the Year awards will be given out.\n\nWhat's going on with NBA officiating?\n\nIs it just me, or have the NBA officials been really inconsistent lately? Referees have been in the spotlight the entire NBA season, which has resulted in the league making adjustments to the way they call fouls over the course of games.\n\nThe idea of teams scoring too many points and the league seeking teams to be more offensive-oriented rather than defensive juggernauts was addressed by Adam Silver and the NBA office on multiple occasions throughout the season. In March, the league's competition committee held a meeting to outline the issue of offensive players taking advantage of rules that were in place.\n\nA memo that was shared with all 30 teams and obtained by ClutchPoints in March discussed the idea and definition of a player being in a \"legal guarding position\" on defense. The level of contact and what is deemed \"marginal contact\" were also ideas expressed to teams.\n\nSince this meeting, the officiating across the NBA and throughout the early portion of the NBA Playoffs has been very inconsistent. It doesn't seem like all of the referees are on the same page about what marginal contact means, nor is there a full grasp on defenders being in a legal guarding position.\n\nEssentially, the league wants to ensure fair play and not have the officials utilize their whistle on every single play. Sure, there may be a foul or contact every time one of these guys drives to the rim, but the refs have been letting a lot of calls go in order to allow the flow of a game to progress.\n\nIn doing so, the NBA has created a new problem, one where referees are sometimes too passive in late-game moments where the whistle should be blown. A perfect example of this is what happened at the end of Game 2 between the Knicks and 76ers. Both teams didn't seem to get a fair whistle on multiple occasions, and perhaps the biggest instance of this was with 27 seconds left when the 76ers were inbounding the basketball to Tyrese Maxey. Immediately, the Knicks swarmed Maxey and fouled him, based on findings from the league's L2M report, yet no call was made due to \"marginal contact\" being made.\n\nThere were several other calls or non-calls in this game that the league reviewed and said were incorrect, directly impacting the result of this game in the NBA Playoffs. Joel Embiid has voiced his opinion on the way games are being officiated, and he claimed it is \"unacceptable\" for some of these calls to be made in huge moments of playoff games.\n\n\"Everybody on the floor was trying to call a timeout, myself included, Nico [Nic Batum], coach on the sidelines; but they didn't give it to us,\" Embiid told reporters. \"But, you know, forget about a timeout. There's a bunch of fouls. Like I said, that's f***ing unacceptable.\"\n\nLeBron James and D'Angelo Russell also voiced their opinions on the officiating recently following the Los Angeles Lakers' 20-point collapse against the Denver Nuggets on Monday night. Whereas Russell was frustrated after a foul where he got hit in the face was overturned, James took exception to the fact that the league reviewed the play in real-time and still deemed it necessary to overturn.\n\n\"Of course, it's a heartbreaking game. You never want to lose in that fashion,\" LeBron stated before a long pause on Monday night. \"I don't understand what's going on in the replay center, to be honest ... DLo clearly gets hit in the face on the drive. What the f**k do we have a replay center for? ... It doesn't make sense to me.\"\n\nThe NBA has not said anything about the state of the officiating in the NBA Playoffs, nor have they made any public announcement about fines for these players as of Wednesday afternoon. Officiating and blown calls continue to be a key talking point during the playoffs, leading to more questions this upcoming offseason about what the league needs to do in order to ensure fairness of play. After Jontay Porter's expulsion from the league for illegal sports gambling, the last thing the NBA wants to deal with is people making assumptions and doing their own investigations as to whether league officials are involved in any type of game fixing.\n\nAt this time, there is no reason to believe this is the case with any officials.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType":

Middleton has averaged 19 points, 7.5 rebounds and 5 assists through the first two games.\n\nMilwaukee already played the first two games of this series without two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who also missed the Bucks' final three regular-season games after straining his left calf in an April 9 victory over the Boston Celtics.\n\n\"He did a lot of floor stuff today, probably the most I've seen,\" Rivers said. \"Nothing live.

I'm not sure.\"\n\nThe Bucks are accustomed to dealing with injuries during the postseason.\n\nAntetokounmpo missed the final 1\u00bd games of a 2020 second-round loss to Miami with a sprained ankle. He didn't play the final two games of the 2021 Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended knee before returning to lead Milwaukee to the championship as the NBA Finals MVP who scored 50 points in the title-clinching victory.\n\nMiddleton missed the Bucks' final 10 playoff games in 2022 with a sprained medial collateral ligament. Last year, a bruised lower back knocked Antetokounmpo out of Game 1 and caused him to miss the next two games in the Bucks' first-round loss to Miami.\n\nPhotos: Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian

He was shooting and moving today.\"\n\nAntetokounmpo's potential return date or possible availability for Friday remains uncertain.\n\n\"I saw him moving around and my mindset is he's getting close,\" Rivers said. \"Does that mean a day, four days? I'm not sure.\"\n\nThe Bucks are accustomed to dealing with injuries during the postseason.\n\nAntetokounmpo missed the final 1\u00bd games of a 2020 second-round loss to Miami with a sprained ankle. He didn't play the final two games of the 2021 Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended knee before returning to lead Milwaukee to the championship as the NBA Finals MVP who scored 50 points in the title-clinching victory.\n\nMiddleton missed the Bucks' final 10 playoff games in 2022 with a sprained medial collateral ligament. Last year, a bruised lower back knocked Antetokounmpo out of Game 1 and caused him to miss the next two games in the Bucks' first-round loss to Miami.\n\nPhotos: Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian

The bill is named after 10-month-old Esther Jo Bethard of North Prairie, Wisconsin who lost her life after she swallowed a stray water bead that an older sibling had played with months earlier.\n\n\"Parents buy toys and educational materials for their kids with the understanding those products are safe for their children. Sadly, with water beads that is just not the case. We need to do more to prevent kids from ingesting these dangerous products and give parents the confidence they deserve that the toys they buy are safe,\" said Senator Baldwin. \"I am proud to introduce this legislation in Esther's memory to ensure no parent has to go through the pain of losing their child because companies were allowed to market water beads as toys.\"\n\n\"No family should have to figure out how to explain the death of a child to their siblings, or how to have holidays and birthdays without them. Ever. But especially not because of a toy. Esther's Law will help ensure that other families do not have to endure the same senseless tragedy,\" said Taylor Bethard, Esther's Mom. \"Rather than holding Esther each day, I'm left holding onto her tiny shoes, a ring with her perfect curls, while fighting to give her a voice. A voice that shouts our children deserve better. Families deserve better. Thank you for hearing Esther's voice.\"\n\n\"Too many families have faced terrifying hours in the emergency room, worrying about whether their child will survive after swallowing a water bead, a product that is often marketed as a toy,\" said Senator Casey. \"With thousands of children hospitalized in just the last few years, it is clear that this product has no place in the hands of children. This bill will keep kids out of the hospital and prevent more families from facing the nightmare of water bead ingestion.\"\n\n\"The problems associated with water beads were brought to my attention by the mother of a baby girl from Berwick, Maine, who was hospitalized at 9 months old with a life-threatening obstruction after accidentally consuming a single water bead,\" said Senator Collins. \"This bipartisan bill will keep children safe by establishing common sense guidelines for labelling these potentially dangerous toys that have led to more than 7,800 emergency room admissions since 2016.\"\n\nWater beads are small spheres made of super-absorbent polymer that can grow up to 100 times their size - some to nearly the size of a golf ball - when exposed to liquids, making them deadly if they are accidentally ingested by kids and pets. These beads can look like sprinkles or candy and can easily get lost in carpets or other areas where they might later be found and ingested. Once swallowed, water beads swell and can cause poisoning, intestinal blockages, or other medical emergencies - with tragic results.\n\nEsther's Law will protect children and pets by limiting children's access to water beads.

But they can easily scatter across a home and become hidden in carpets or other areas. Young children may mistake them for candy and put them in their mouth, with grave consequences.\n\nThe hazards associated with the products are manifold.\n\nWater beads are small enough for children to choke on, but they can also grow in liquid -- in some cases, swelling to the size of a golf ball. When children swallow them, the beads can expand inside their bodies, causing intestinal blockages, bowel obstructions or lung damage. Some kids may put water beads in their noses or ears, causing pain, hearing damage, blockages or infection.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, the Consumer Product Safety Commission recorded nearly 7,000 emergency room visits for injuries related to water bead ingestion.\n\nA bipartisan bill introduced Thursday in the Senate proposes a ban on the sale of water beads designed or marketed as children's toys, sensory tools or educational or art materials.\n\nThe bill, named \"Esther's Law\" in honor of Bethard, is sponsored by Democratic Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.\n\n\"Parents buy toys and educational materials for their kids with the understanding those products are safe for their children. Sadly, with water beads that is just not the case,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"We need to do more to prevent kids from ingesting these dangerous products and give parents the confidence they deserve that the toys they buy are safe.\"\n\nThe bill instructs the CPSC to establish the ban, since the agency has the authority to outlaw hazardous products to protect the public. It also directs the CPSC to require warning labels on water bead packages that aren't meant for children and to consider regulating the colors of water beads that aren't children's toys but pose an ingestion hazard.\n\nThe CPSC has previously urged parents to remove water beads from any environment with children ages 3 or younger. Childcare centers, camps and schools should avoid the beads entirely, according to the agency. The CPSC has also recalled certain products that contain water beads, including the toy kit linked to Bethard's death.\n\nBut some parents, nonprofits and lawmakers have pushed for a total ban in the U.S.\n\n\"Esther's Law will help ensure that other families do not have to endure the same senseless tragedy,\" Taylor Bethard, Esther's mother, said in a statement. \"Rather than holding Esther each day, I'm left holding onto her tiny shoes, a ring with her perfect curls, while fighting to give her a voice.\"\n\nThe CPSC does not take a position on legislation, but the agency's chair, Alex Hoehn-Saric, underscored the need to prevent future injuries and deaths.\n\n\"While CPSC is taking steps to address these hazards, the regulatory process can be long and time-consuming,\" Hoehn-Saric said in a statement. \"The fastest way to address the hazard that water beads present, protect children and babies, and prevent more parents from experiencing these tragedies is with a legislative mandate. I am pleased that Congress is engaged and am hopeful that the process can move forward quickly.\"\n\nThe new bill is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as Amazon, Target and Walmart. All three retailers stopped selling water beads in December.\n\nA separate bill introduced in the House last year by New Jersey Rep. Frank Joseph Pallone Jr. similarly proposes a ban on water beads marketed for kids.\n\nThe CPSC has additionally warned that certain water beads contain unsafe levels of acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen.\n\nInjuries related to the products can be difficult to identify and treat, since water beads don't always show up on X-rays. Some children may require surgery to remove the beads.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This bipartisan bill would prohibit water beads from being sold as toys, educational products, sensory tools, or art materials for children under 14. Esther's Law is named for Esther Jo Bethard, a 10-month-old from North Prairie, Wisconsin, who died after ingesting water beads. As detailed in a CR investigation, water beads pose severe risks to children if accidentally inhaled or ingested, including internal injuries, long-term health issues, and even death.\n\nDozens of consumer advocacy organizations, parent advocates, and disability justice groups have endorsed Esther's Law, including Consumer Reports and That Water Bead Lady. Amazon, Walmart, Target, and other major retailers have also endorsed the bill.\n\n\"Water beads may seem innocent, but their potential for harm is anything but,\" said Gabe Knight, safety policy analyst at Consumer Reports. \"They send thousands of children to the ER every year, and children have died after swallowing them. This bill is a crucial step toward preventing future tragedies. With bipartisan backing and strong support from parents, consumer advocates, and retailers, Esther's Law should be passed without delay.\"\n\n\"The introduction of Esther's Law represents a beacon of hope for countless families who have experienced the devastating effects of a water bead injury,\" said parent advocate Ashley Haugen, founder and president of That Water Bead Lady. \"This law embodies the courage of survivors like Kipley Haugen and Kennedy Mitchell and honors the memory of Esther Bethard. We are grateful to the lawmakers who have listened to our concerns and are taking action to make children's safety a top priority.\"\n\nEsther's Law, introduced by Senators Tammy Baldwin, Bob Casey, and Susan Collins, would ban water bead products marketed for children under fourteen years old as toys, educational materials, sensory tools, or art materials. The bill would also direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to finalize a safety standard for water beads that would not be subject to the ban and remain on sale in the market. The rule would include warning labels on packages and may include requirements on the colors of the water beads.\n\nRepresentative Frank Pallone introduced a separate bill, the Ban Water Beads Act, in the House of Representatives in November 2023. The bill, which CR endorsed, would similarly prohibit water beads from being sold as toys, educational products, sensory tools, or art materials.\n\nConsumer Reports' September 2023 investigation exposed the lethal hazards associated with water beads, commonly marketed as toys and sensory aids for children. These small, colorful expanding gel balls can easily be swallowed, inhaled, or inserted in an ear or nostril and grow dramatically, once inside a child's body and wet. Water beads can be challenging to clean up and remove from the home if spilled or dropped as they easily scatter, roll away, and become hidden under furniture, in baseboards, or carpets. Despite being banned in some countries, water beads remain available for sale in the U.S.\n\nFollowing CR's investigation and outreach to major retailers, Amazon, Target, Walmart, Michaels, and other companies told CR they have taken various steps to restrict the sale of water beads marketed for young children. Consumer Reports advocates for the complete removal of water beads for children from the market through federal regulation. CR and That Water Bead Lady also launched petitions urging the CPSC to ban or sharply limit the sale of water beads that collectively received over 100,000 signatures.\n\nCR offers the following tips to help keep their families safe from water beads:", "source": {"uri": "advocacy.consumerreports.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "CR Advocacy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_gel_(plain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water gel (plain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Reports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Prairie,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Prairie, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Prairie, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swallowing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Casey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Casey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ER (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

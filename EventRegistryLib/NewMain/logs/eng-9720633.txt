The 18-year-old, citing her experience of contracting 'a post-viral condition' in 2019, urged the LA County Board of Supervisors 'to confront the long COVID crisis' by strengthening pandemic-era protections in hospitals and government buildings.\n\n'I demand mask availability, air filtration and Far-UVC light in government facilitates, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical faculties,' Violet (Pictured), who is often seen wearing a face mask, said. 'You must expand the availability of high-quality free tests and treatment, and most importantly the county must oppose mask bans for any reason. They do not keep us safer.' Violet's controversial speech was met with both praise and criticisms, with some hailing her as 'courageous' and others 'utterly deluded'.\n\nHer plea comes just weeks after it emerged that Dr Anthony Fauci admitted the restrictions he put in place during lockdown didn't do much to 'slow the spread' of covid, and as lawmakers are signaling an openness to reinstating mask bans amid a rise in clashes at protests. Violet argued that anti-mask measures are making 'vulnerable members of our community less safe' and 'make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together'. She also detailed her experience of contracting 'a post-viral condition' in 2019, and said she 'saw first-hand' that medicine doesn't always have answers to the 'consequences of even minor viruses'.\n\nThe teen, introducing herself, told the board: 'Hi, Violet Affleck, Los Angeles resident, first time voter, I'm 18.' She then shared: 'I contracted a post-viral condition in 2019. I'm okay now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses.' The eldest daughter of the Argo director, 51, and the 13 Going on 30 star, 52 -- who divorced in 2018 -- then spoke about the COVID-19 pandemic and how 'one in ten infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological, cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see and even think. It stands to exacerbate our homelessness crisis, as well as the suffering of many people in our city. It hits communities of color, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public facing essential job the hardest.'\n\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is the governing body for Los Angeles County, where Violet resides. The Board holds regular meetings where the public can register to speak on specific issues. Violet was slammed online for her controversial stance on masking, with some social media users branding her speech as a 'travesty'. 'Wait wait wait, hold up,' one X user wrote. 'Violet Affleck contracted a post viral condition *before* the CV19 pandemic, in 2019, and her family STILL don't mask around her?!? 'How many images have we seen of her with her family, & she's the only one masked?? God what a travesty.' One echoed: 'This Violet Affleck kid is utterly deluded. She is still wearing a mask. Masks never worked but in the height of Covid fear, she may have had an excuse that others are wearing one.' 'Is Violet Affleck the original Karen?' another user questioned.\n\nOne X user further went on to accuse the teen of 'gaslighting her audience', claiming that there are 'plenty of photos and videos of her NOT WEARING A MASK before, during and after the pandemic'. 'Why do people choose to believe the opposite of what their eyes prove?' they added. Another questioned: 'Are there actual mask bans? Is that a thing?' However, many X users issued their support for the teen, saying she is a 'hero' and 'smart kid'. 'At 18 she has more courage than some people will ever have in their entire lifetimes,' one person wrote. 'Amazing testimony! Violet is 100% on COVID Twitter. Thank you!' another added. 'I wish more celebrities had the courage of Violet Affleck. She's only 18 years old and is doing more than any politician.' 'Extremely impressive how much she fit into that one minute,' someone else chimed in. 'Violet Affleck is Ben Affleck's daughter. She continues to be even more impressive as a teenager. I can't wait to see what she does as an adult.'\n\nViolet has consistently been seen wearing a mask in the past years, though her parents never publicly explained why. She was seen wearing one at Michael Rubin's White Party in 2023, recently in May 2024 while spending time with her mom, and while attending a Broadway show with Ben and her stepmom Jennifer Lopez. Garner and Affleck also share Fin (formerly Seraphina), 15, and son Samuel, 12. The former pair met on the set of the movie Pearl Harbor in the early 2000s, but didn't start dating until later. In 2004, shortly after his first broken engagement to Lopez, the two sparked up a romance, before getting married in 2005. Violet was born that same year in December. Fin followed in 2009 and Samuel in 2012. The duo announced their separation in 2015 after nearly 10 years of marriage, and officially filed for divorce in 2017. Garner has since moved on with businessman John Miller. Affleck rekindled his romance with Lopez in April 2021. The two wed in Vegas in July 2022, followed by a lavish ceremony in Georgia in August.\n\nHowever, the pair's marriage has been hit by split claims for the past two months. Violet's passionate plea to the LA County Board of Supervisors comes a month after the publication of Fauci's bombshell testimony in which he admitted to making up the six foot social distancing rule and other measures to 'protect' Americans from covid. Republicans put out the full transcript of their sit down interview with Fauci from January just days before his highly- anticipated public testimony in June. Speaking to counsel on behalf of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic earlier this year, Fauci told Republicans that the six foot social distancing rule 'sort of just appeared' and that he did not recall how it came about. 'You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared,' he said according to committee transcripts when pressed on how the rule came about. He added he 'was not aware of studies' that supported the social distancing, conceding that such studies 'would be very difficult' to do.\n\nIn addition to not recalling any evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he didn't remember reading anything to support that masking kids would prevent COVID. 'Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?' he was asked. 'I might have,' he responded before adding 'but I don't recall specifically that I did.' The pandemic patriarch also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, of which there have been many. And his answer was an ironic COVID-esque pun, 'I still think that's up in the air,' Fauci said about whether masking kids was a solid way to prevent transmission.\n\nKids' learning loss and social setbacks have been well documented, with one National Institute of Health (NIH) study calling the impact of mask use on students' literacy and learning 'very negative.' And the impacts from social distancing caused' depression, generalized anxiety, acute stress, and intrusive thoughts,' another NIH study found. In May this year, a new study revealed that face masks haven't protected against Covid since at least 2022. Researchers in the UK re-analyzed data on more than 100,000 people's habits and Covid test results during the pandemic. They found that masks were linked to about a 30 percent lower risk of infections throughout 2021 - but the protective effect disappeared in February 2022. That was when the Omicron variant took off and became dominant in the UK, and that summer in the US, which the researchers believe made the virus too infectious for masks to stop people getting infected. While surveys show most UK adults are done with masks, they became highly politicized in the US. A poll from 2023 found that 12 percent of Americans were still wearing a mask in public and they are common in hospitals and doctor's practices.\n\nMasks have yet again become politicized in America, with some elected officials suggesting they are open to reinstating decades-old mask bans following tense clashes during pro-Palestine protests. Leaders in New York City and Los Angeles are among those considering mask bans, alleging that violent demonstrators use them to conceal their identities, NBC reported. Republicans in North Carolina recently signed a mask restriction legislation into law. Supporters cited safety concerns at demonstrations, while critics argued the legislation inhibited free speech rights. Similarly, student protesters at colleges in Florida, Ohio and Texas have been threatened by local police and school personnel that they could be arrested or face felony charges for wearing masks during demonstrations.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

She argued in favor of making masks and free COVID-19 tests easily available, in contrast to LA Mayor Karen Bass floating the idea in late June that masks be banned at protests.\n\nDays after Bass made her anti-mask comments, her office announced that she had contracted COVID-19 and would be attending meetings remotely. The virus is currently surging in California, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's wastewater tracking data shows a high load of the virus in the state. At least 420 people have died of the virus in Los Angeles County so far in 2024, and the county's public health guidelines still vaunt masking as \"a great way to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.\"\n\nViolet, wearing a white medical face mask and black-framed glasses, spoke for about a minute during the public comment portion of the meeting. She said that in 2019, she contracted a post-viral condition that has lent her perspective on the matter.\n\n\"I'm OK now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses,\" she said. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief.\"\n\n\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological [and] cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see, and even think,\" she said. She highlighted vulnerable populations that were especially susceptible to the effects of COVID-19.\n\n\"They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together,\" she said. Violet has been photographed out with her parents and stepmother Jennifer Lopez walking her talk, wearing a mask in public.\n\nIn her speech, Violet also advocated for \"mask availability, air filtration, and far-UVC light in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical facilities.\"\n\n\"Most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans

Covid is on the rise, in fact Kismet just got it a couple of weeks ago. Many of us are still masking and we appreciate the example Violet is setting, especially for young people. It turns out that she developed a viral illness in 2019 and that it informed her decision to continue to mask. Violet spoke in front of the LA County Board of Supervisors recently to advocate for mask availability, for cleaner public indoor spaces, and for not enacting bans on masks. A Twitter user posted a video her speech, and that's below. She reminds me so much of her mother, Jennifer Garner, who has spoken both in front of Congress and the California State Assembly.\n\nViolet Affleck... made a rare public appearance on Tuesday at a regularly scheduled meeting of the LA County Board of Supervisors.\n\nDuring public comments, where residents have the opportunity to address the board, Violet -- who wore a protective face mask at the public event -- advocated for the expansion of mask availability and other important means of maintaining public safety, while also revealing her own experience with the long-term after effects of contracting a viral infection.\n\n\"I contracted a post-viral condition in 2019,\" Violet revealed. \"I'm OK now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief.\"\n\n\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological and cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, see, move and even think,\" Violet shared during the board meeting, while explaining that it has hit vulnerable communities hardest across the country.\n\n\"To confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration and far-UVC lights in government facilities, including jails and detention centers,\" she stated, \"and mask mandates in county medical facilities.\"\n\n\"We must expand the availability of free tests and treatment and, most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason,\" Violet declared, speaking quickly to fit her message within the allotted minute-long timeframe. \"They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together. Thank you.\"\n\n[From ET Online]\n\nHaving a serious illness like that really changes your whole worldview. I've had covid about three times and was tired for weeks despite being vaccinated and boosted. When I stopped wearing a mask for a couple of months earlier this year I got a GI bug (which could have been covid IDK). I now mask again in most public places, including larger gym classes and at the grocery store. I'm so lucky to not have contracted long covid, but I know people who have. Violet is right that long covid is debilitating and I would add that it's not getting enough attention. At the very least, I hope mask bans are not enforceable in LA County. It would be great if they were not enforceable nationwide. I would assume that's covered by the Americans with Disability Act. Good for Violet for advocating for public safety and for using her profile for a good cause. She surely knew how much attention she would get for speaking and it cannot have been an easy decision.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long COVID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kismet_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kismet (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Public_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Public Administration", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi_Gras", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi Gras", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720633", "eventUri": "eng-9720633", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

They do not keep us safer.\"\n\nAlthough masks are not banned in Los Angeles, the mayor Karen Bass has previously signalled she is open to reinstating the antiquated measure at protests to stop \"individuals using masks to evade responsibility for criminal or threatening behaviour\".\n\nIn her speech, Garner and Affleck's daughter referred back to the COVID-19 pandemic and cited how \"one in ten infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological, cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see and even think.\"\n\nViolet continued: \"It stands to exacerbate our homelessness crisis, as well as the suffering of many people in our city. It hits communities of colour, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public facing essential job the hardest.\"\n\nThe 18 year old's impassioned speech received mixed responses online, with one X/Twitter user questioning why she's the only person in her family to be spotted wearing a mask.\n\n\"Wait wait wait, hold up,Violet Affleck contracted a post viral condition *before* the CV19 pandemic, in 2019, and her family STILL don't mask around her?!?\" they wrote. \"How many images have we seen of her with her family, & she's the only one masked?? God what a travesty.\"\n\nHowever, other users praised Violet, writing: \"I wish more celebrities had the courage of Violet Affleck.

County Board of Supervisors meeting, the 18-year-old not only explained why she often masks, but used her voice to oppose mask bans and advocate for mask availability and other COVID prevention solutions in all government facilities.\n\nIn a video shared on Twitter, Affleck spoke up to share her perspective as a first-time voter and L.A.

Mask Ban at Supervisors Meeting", "body": "Gabby Petito's Texts Show 'More and More Tension' With Brian Laundrie\n\nViolet Affleck is using her voice! The eldest child of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner took some time to give her views on the potential ban on masks in Los Angeles, California.\n\nViolet, 18, spoke at the L.A. County Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday, July 9, and opposed the potential new law that would prohibit people from wearing masks.\n\n\"I'm 18. I contracted a post-viral condition in 2019. I'm okay now, but I saw firsthand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses,\" Violet stated. \"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see and even think stands to exacerbate our homelessness crisis, as well as the suffering of many people in our city.\"\n\nOfficials in New York City and Los Angeles have recently seemed open to the idea of banning masks due to an increase in violence surrounding public protests and demonstrations. Several tense protests regarding the Israel-Hamas war have resulted in local authorities claiming that people are wearing masks as a way to conceal their identity, as opposed to protecting themselves from any potential illnesses. However, Violet voiced her beliefs that banning masks would only harm those in marginalized communities.\n\nViolet continued, \"It hits communities of color, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public-facing essential job the hardest. To confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration and far-UVC light in government facilities, including jails and detention centers and mask mandates in county medical facilities. We must expand the availability of high-quality free tests and treatment.\"\n\nViolet ended her passionate speech by saying, \"And most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason they do not keep us safer. They make them vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.\"\n\nAlong with Violet, Ben, 51, and Jennifer, 52, share children Fin, 15, and Samuel, 12. While the exes have mostly kept their kids out of the spotlight, Violet has been seen sporting a mask around Los Angeles. The teen recently graduated from high school and, according to People, it looks like Violet has an Ivy League in her sights. She was seen in a photo from her school's Instagram page that showed the students wearing shirts with the colleges they planned on attending emblazoned on them and Violet was sporting an ensemble representing Yale.\n\nThe 13 Going on 30 star's reaction to Violet leaving the nest went viral when she shared several photos of herself crying during various moments, including Violet's graduation.\n\n\"Tell me you have a graduate without telling me you have a graduate. (bless our hearts),\" Jennifer wrote via Instagram on May 20.\n\nThe Switch-Up star even included a video clip of herself crying while sitting on a plane and asking, \"How are we going to make it? What are we going to do?\"\n\nThe mom of three was comforted by several of her friends in the comments, including Reese Witherspoon.\n\n\"Oh honey ... I know. You have done a great job , mama!

(Bellocqimages/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images/Getty Images)\n\nLong gone are the days of mandated masking in public to protect against COVID -- but many people still benefit from the practice. Violet Affleck, the 18-year-old daughter of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, spoke during the public comments section of a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting asking for a return of mask mandates in county medical facilities.\n\n\"I contracted a post-viral condition in 2019,\" she said according to CNN. \"I'm OK now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses.\"\n\nShe went on to ask public health officials to consider the effects of long COVID, in which the symptoms of the disease linger for months or even years.\n\n\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological and cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, see, move and even think,\" Affleck said. \"To confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration and far-UVC lights in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical facilities.\"\n\nShe added that the county should \"oppose mask bans for any reason.\" Indeed, this comes at a time when city officials in New York City and Los Angeles have signaled that they're open to establishing \"mask bans\" again after tense pro-Palestine protests. Critics have called these moves a \"dog whistle\" to squash protest.\n\nIn North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed legislation that would have banned masking in public, also brought forth in response to recent protests. But Cooper only vetoed the law because the bill included provisions related to campaign financing, not because of the implications for public health. State lawmakers eventually overrode the veto in June, passing a revised version of the law that restored health exemptions for masking.\n\nAffleck concluded that the bans \"do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Long COVID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog whistle (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/jennifer_garner_violet_affleck_2152001204.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720633", "eventUri": "eng-9720633", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-05-", "textStart": 56, "textEnd": 62}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

And much like her humanitarian advocate mom, it's starting with speaking out about causes that are important to her, starting with the importance of masking for public health.\n\nViolet, who's often spotted out and about in a face mask, spoke about the importance of masks for public health during a July 9 LA County Board of Supervisors meeting. In a rare move for the private teen, she stepped up to the lectern during the public comments portion of the meeting and opened up about her own personal connection to the issue.\n\nAfter introducing herself by name and noting that she'll be a first-time voter this year, Affleck opened her comments by sharing that she \"contracted a post-viral condition in 2019.\"\n\n\"I'm OK now, but I saw firsthand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses,\" said Affleck, as seen in a video of her comments posted to X. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief.\"\n\nAffleck went on to share some powerful examples, including the CDC statistic that 1 in 10 COVID infections leads to long COVID, which she described as \"a devastating neurological cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see, and even think.\" While Affleck didn't specify the virus that caused her own post-viral condition, VeryWell Health notes that post-viral syndrome often causes \"enduring fatigue and other flu-like symptoms\" following a viral infection. Other signs include general weakness, muscle pain, depression, difficulty sleeping, shortness of breath, and brain fog -- all symptoms we've come to associate with long COVID.\n\nHaving experienced something so similar, Affleck didn't mince words about long COVID and what her city should do about it. \"To confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration, and far UVC light in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical facilities,\" she stated. We must expand the availability of high-quality free tests and treatment.\"\n\nHer final point took aim at a troubling new trend of mask bans around the country. Per NBC News, face politicians in cities like New York and states like North Carolina are blaming face masks for emboldening protesters to use violence. Affleck made her opinion on the issue very clear. \"Most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason,\" she emphasized. \"They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.\"\n\nCommenters on X were quick to support Affleck's courage and eloquence. \"Amazing testimony!\" wrote one person. \"Violet nailed this!\" said another. \"I'm showing this to my 7 & 9 year old girls as a great example of a smart, thoughtful and self assured young woman 1) doing what she knows is right, even in the face of massive societal pressure to cave [and] 2) using her voice & privilege for the greater good.\"\n\nWe just know that Affleck's mom must be even prouder of her daughter. Garner has a long legacy of advocate work herself as an artist ambassador and board member for Save the Children and once testified in front of California senators to pass a bill to protect her kids' privacy from paparazzi (the bill was signed into law in 2013).\n\nWhile only time will tell whether Affleck's advocating is as successful as her mom's, one thing is clear: like her famous parents, she's not afraid to take a stand for the things that matter to her.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_ryan@sheknows.com", "name": "Maggie Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Long COVID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouding_of_consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clouding of consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza-like illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insomnia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/violet-affleck-post-viral-infection-face-masks.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720633", "eventUri": "eng-9720633", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 554, "textEnd": 560}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief.\"\n\nViolet's speech also touched upon the broader implications of post-viral conditions, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, can arise after a viral infection. These conditions may include symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, memory loss, inability to focus, and exhaustion.\n\n\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological and cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, see, move, and even think,\" Violet explained. She emphasized that COVID has disproportionately affected vulnerable communities across the country. As Violet continues her college studies, her efforts to raise awareness and drive change in public health policies serve as an inspiring example of the power of individual voices in shaping a healthier future for all.\n\nViolet's speech is also surprising, especially after reports of Garner grappling with the heightened public attention on her children due to her ex-husband Ben Affleck's relationship with Jennifer Lopez. Sources say the situation has left Garner blindsided and concerned for her children's well-being.\n\nAn insider close to Garner revealed to Fox News Digital that she was caught off guard by the intense media scrutiny that followed Affleck and Lopez's renewed romance and subsequent marriage. \"Jennifer Garner felt blindsided by Ben's relationship with JLo,\" the source shared. \"She doesn't like her kids in the public eye so much, and that's been hard for her.\"\n\nIn June, Violet was seen departing The Maybourne Hotel after enjoying lunch with her step-mom, Jennifer Lopez, and an unidentified friend. The casual yet chic outing highlighted the close bond between Jennifer and Violet, despite separation rumors between Violet's dad, Ben Affleck and Jlo.

Bass' announcement came as a response to a pro-Palestinian protest near a Los Angeles synagogue that made international headlines, per The Guardian.\n\nBoth outlets note that other political leaders, such as New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, both Democrats, have supported the idea of banning masks at protests and on public transit because they feel the masks offer anonymity to people who wish to engage in antisemitic behavior.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told USA Today that \"bans on the use of masks strongly

County Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday as a Los Angeles resident and first-time voter, Violet Affleck explained that she developed a post-viral condition in 2019. In a clip shared on social media, she said that while she is OK now, it showed her that \"medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief.\"\n\n\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastation neurological, cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see and even think\" she said.\n\nTo help reduce the risk, she called for mask availability and other COVID prevention measures like air filtration and the use of far UV-C light, which can kill viruses, in government facilities, including jails. She also urged mask mandates in county medical facilities.\n\n\"We must expand availability of high quality, free tests and treatment,\" she said. \"And most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason. They do not keep us safer. They make more vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.\"\n\nAffleck said COVID still \"hits communities of color, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public-facing essential jobs the hardest.\"\n\nHer comments come at a time when COVID cases are once again on the rise in the U.S., particularly in western states.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, millions of Americans have experienced long COVID, also known as post-COVID syndrome or condition, which may include a continuation of symptoms similar to the original infection, like fatigue and shortness of breath, according to the Mayo Clinic, Symptoms can also include memory loss, generalized pain and orthostasis, decreased blood pressure when standing up or sitting down, and an array of other problems.\n\nMask mandates to prevent the spread of COVID were issued in cities across the U.S. at the height of the pandemic in 2020, but as cases went down, most places stopped requiring masks.\n\nRecently, some cities have weighed proposals to ban masks -- a development that concerns those who rely on masks to help prevent illness.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul backed the idea of a mask ban in New York City's subway system aimed at criminals covering their faces -- but with exceptions for people wearing masks for their health. A similar mask ban was proposed by a local alderman in Chicago earlier this month, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass weighed a mask ban for protesters to make it easier to identify those who allegedly commit crimes, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nCalifornia's Division of Public Health rescinded its mask requirement for medical professionals in February when COVID cases receded. The state, however, said it could reverse course if the threat of COVID increases.\n\nThe department recommends those infected with COVID or who could have been exposed should still wear a mask, as well as people who are vulnerable to getting sick, like the elderly or those with medical conditions.\n\nSo-called strategic masking, or \"wearing a mask where and when it might matter most,\" can be an option for decreasing your risk of COVID, according to a 2023 report from Yale Medicine.

They make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together,\" she said at the end of her comment.\n\nWearing a face mask can lower the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses, according to the CDC.\n\nWhen Affleck recently graduated high school, her proud mother shared a photo of herself looking emotional at the ceremony.\n\n\"Tell me you have a graduate without telling me you have a graduate. \ud83c\udf93 (bless our hearts \ud83e\udd7a\u2665\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23),\" she captioned the post.\n\nAffleck and her two siblings have mostly stayed out of the spotlight over the years, but she appeared with her mother at a White House state dinner in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Mask Ban at Board of Supervisors Meeting", "body": "Kamala Harris Reacts to Donald Trump's Guilty Verdict: \"Cheaters Don't Like Getting Caught\"\n\nViolet Affleck is taking a stand against Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass' proposed mask ban.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck's 18-year-old daughter spoke up at a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting, expressing how harmful the ban could be.\n\nWhile taking the podium, the teen described herself as a \"first-time voter.\" The younger Affleck explained that she contracted a \"post-viral condition\" in 2019. \"I'm OK now but I saw firsthand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief.\" she said. The teen then said, \"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological, cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see or even think.\"\n\n\"To confront the long COVID crisis,\" she added, \"I demand mask availability, air filtration and Far-UVC lighting in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates at county medical facilities.\" She also asked for a wider availability of free COVID testing and treatment.\n\n\"Most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason,\" she continued. \"They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.\"\n\nFollowing a pro-Palestine protest outside of the Adas Torah synagogue in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood of Los Angeles, mayor Bass announced she was considering a mask ban for protests.\n\nDuring a news conference held on June 24, Bass declared that she would be in conversation with City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto to discuss \"several things that we need to examine,\" such as \"permits for protests, the idea of people wearing masks at protests and establishing clear lines of demarcations of what is legal and what is not.\"\n\nA mask ban was also proposed in New York by Governor Kathy Hochul, out of concern over people hiding their identity while committing antisemitic hate crimes. \"We will not tolerate individuals using masks to evade responsibility for criminal or threatening behavior,\" Hochul said in a news conference in June. \"My team is working on a solution.

Pictured with her mother in May, carrying a book on health inequality\n\nThe former Hollywood couple's eldest child, citing her experience of contracting 'a post-viral condition' in 2019, urged the LA County Board of Supervisors 'to confront the long COVID crisis' by strengthening pandemic-era protections in hospitals and government buildings.\n\n'I demand mask availability, air filtration and Far-UVC light in government facilitates, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical faculties,' Violet, who is often seen wearing a face mask, said.\n\n'You must expand the availability of high-quality free tests and treatment, and most importantly the county must oppose mask bans for any reason. They do not keep us safer.'\n\nAnd although it's her most vocal to date, it's far from being the first time Violet made a public stance.\n\nShe has often made her political views clear through paparazzi photos - through clothing choices or by carrying books.\n\nViolet has also often been pictured wearing a mask at events with her family - even if she has been the only one to do so.\n\nIn May, the teen also appeared to send a message for the cameras as she and her mother were snapped in Santa Monica.\n\nWearing a pink summer dress and cream cardigan, Violet also had a mask on and carried a copy of The Viral Underclass: The Human Toll When Inequality and Disease Collide by Steven W. Thrasher.\n\nElsewhere in January, she accompanied her mask with a black sweater adorned with a watermelon. The clothing item sent a message of solidarity with Palestine, and sparked demand for the shirt\n\nEven one of Violet's more public appearances was in a political space. In 2022, she and her mother arrived at the White House to attend a state dinner - hosted by Joe and Gill Biden - for the visiting President Emmanuel Macron\n\nThe former Hollywood couple's eldest child, citing her experience of contracting 'a post-viral condition' in 2019, urged the LA County Board of Supervisors 'to confront the long COVID crisis'\n\nThe book examines global health inequality, in particular looking at the 'the racialisation, policing, and criminalisation of HIV'.\n\nAn online Waterstones blurb reads: 'Told through the heart-rending stories of friends, activists, and teachers navigating the novel coronavirus, HIV, and other viruses, Dr. Thrasher brings the reader with him as he delves into the viral underclass and lays bare its inner workings.\n\n'In the tradition of Isabel Wilkerson's Caste and Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow, The Viral Underclass helps us understand the world more deeply by showing the fraught relationship between privilege and survival.'\n\nElsewhere in January, she accompanied her mask with a black sweater adorned with a watermelon.\n\nThe clothing item sent a message of solidarity with Palestine, and sparked demand for the shirt, which is made by a Chicago clothing company Wear the Peace, which is raising funds for aid in devastated Gaza.\n\nThe long-sleeve Violet was wearing looks to be available for \u00a327 online, and 100% of the profits are donated to Pious Projects of America.\n\nAccording to the website, 'the funds will be used for Pious Projects' on-ground team in Gaza to supply food, water, medical aid, and other necessities. 100% of profits is equal to $11'.\n\nIt continues: 'This is after our costs of manufacturing in the US, garments, screen printing, transaction fees, rush fees incurred for logistics and transit, and warehouse employee wages to ship the items.'\n\nSpeaking to the Chicago Sun Times, Murad Nofal and Mustafa Mabruk - who run the clothing line - said they had to hire extra staff after Violet's appearance.\n\nSome of her more lighthearted clothing choices have also been political in nature - in May, she donned a parody of a Barack Obama HOPE campaign shirt, replacing the former US president with Shiv Roy from Succession - and featuring the word POWER instead\n\nEven one of Violet's more public appearances was in a political space. In 2022, she and her mother arrived at the White House to attend a state dinner - hosted by Joe and Gill Biden - for the visiting President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nSome of her more lighthearted clothing choices have also been political in nature - in May, she donned a parody of a Barack Obama HOPE campaign shirt, replacing the former US president with Shiv Roy from Succession - and featuring the word POWER instead.\n\nIt is perhaps no wonder that Violet has a mind for politics, given both her parents have been very involved in causes over the years.\n\nAlthough her views on Biden's current presidential campaign are not clear, Jennifer, 52, has been a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party and has featured in television ads for candidates. The actress has also been outspoken on climate issues.\n\nElsewhere her father Ben, 51, has been staunchly interested in politics and throughout the 2000s even voiced an interest in running for office one day - although he has since said it's not an ambition of his.\n\nHe has also been vocal on issues such as a fair minimum wage, reproductive rights, LGBT causes and the climate.\n\nIn October, Ben was also one of the actors who called for a ceasefire in Gaza. It's also not surprising that Violet may want to voice her views in different ways, as her mother has spoken about not letting her use Instagram.\n\nViolet doesn't appear to have a public account, but it is not clear if she has a private one.\n\nIn 2016, when Violet was in middle school, Jennifer told TODAY: 'She's not on social media yet -- her school has a no social media policy until 6th grade -- but I know it's coming soon.'\n\nBut three years later - as reported by People - the mother revealed she was still on the fence about letting her eldest on the app during an appearance on Next Question with Katie Couric.\n\n'She'll occasionally talk to me about getting Instagram, and I can see why because I'm on there and it's something kind of fun that I do, and I am modeling the opposite of what I want for her to do. How often is that in parenting?' she said.\n\n'I just say, \"When you can show me studies that say that teenage girls are happier using Instagram than not, then we can have the conversation\".\n\n'But everything you look at, I don't see anything positive for you out there. You can look at mine when you want to, we can go over it together, but I just don't see it.'\n\nViolet's latest impassioned plea to the government comes following her experience of contracting 'a post-viral condition' in 2019.\n\nShe urged the LA County Board of Supervisors 'to confront the long COVID crisis' by strengthening pandemic-era protections in hospitals and government buildings.\n\nThe teen's speech was met with both praise and criticisms, with some hailing her as 'courageous' and others 'utterly deluded'.\n\nHer plea comes just weeks after it emerged that Dr Anthony Fauci admitted the restrictions he put in place during lockdown didn't do much to 'slow the spread' of Covid, and as lawmakers are signaling an openness to reinstating mask bans amid a rise in clashes at protests.\n\nViolet argued that anti-mask measures are making 'vulnerable members of our community less safe' and 'make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together'.\n\nShe also detailed her experience of contracting 'a post-viral condition' in 2019, and said she 'saw first-hand' that medicine doesn't always have answers to the 'consequences of even minor viruses'.\n\nMany on social media issued their support for the teen, saying she is a 'hero' and 'smart kid'. However, others were more critical\n\n'Amazing testimony! Violet is 100% on COVID Twitter. Thank you!' another added.\n\nThe teen, introducing herself, told the board: 'Hi, Violet Affleck, Los Angeles resident, first time voter, I'm 18.'\n\nShe then shared: 'I contracted a post-viral condition in 2019. I'm okay now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses.'\n\nViolet then spoke about the COVID-19 pandemic and how 'one in ten infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological, cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see and even think.'\n\n'It stands to exacerbate our homelessness crisis, as well as the suffering of many people in our city. It hits communities of color, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public facing essential job the hardest.'\n\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is the governing body for Los Angeles County, where Violet resides. The Board holds regular meetings where the public can register to speak on specific issues.\n\nMany on social media issued their support for the teen, saying she is a 'hero' and 'smart kid'.\n\n'At 18 she has more courage than some people will ever have in their entire lifetimes,' one person wrote.\n\n'I wish more celebrities had the courage of Violet Affleck. She's only 18 years old and is doing more than any politician.'\n\n'Extremely impressive how much she fit into that one minute,' someone else chimed in.\n\n'Violet Affleck is Ben Affleck's daughter. She continues to be even more impressive as a teenager. I can't wait to see what she does as an adult.'\n\nHowever others were more critical.\n\n'Wait wait wait, hold up,' one X user wrote. 'Violet Affleck contracted a post viral condition *before* the CV19 pandemic, in 2019, and her family STILL don't mask around her?!?\n\nIt is perhaps no wonder that Violet has a mind for politics, given both her parents have been very involved in causes over the years.

God what a travesty.'\n\nOne echoed: 'This Violet Affleck kid is utterly deluded. She is still wearing a mask. Masks never worked but in the height of Covid fear, she may have had an excuse that others are wearing one.'\n\nViolet - who is rumoured to be heading to Yale University in the fall - has consistently been seen wearing a mask in the past years, though her parents never publicly explained why.\n\nShe was seen wearing one at Michael Rubin's White Party in 2023, recently in May 2024 while spending time with her mom, and while attending a Broadway show with Ben and her stepmom Jennifer Lopez.\n\nGarner and Affleck also share Fin (formerly Seraphina), 15, and son Samuel, 12.\n\nThe former pair met on the set of the movie Pearl Harbor in the early 2000s, but didn't start dating until later.\n\nIn 2004, shortly after his first broken engagement to Lopez, the two sparked up a romance, before getting married in 2005.\n\nViolet was born that same year in December.

His interrogation led to the recovery of 268 bitcoins worth \u20b9138 crore, said a senior official on the condition of anonymity.\n\nED's probe has revealed that Parvinder and co-accused used vendor marketing sites on the dark web and a network of narcotics and controlled substance distributors and distribution cells to sell drugs in the USA, the UK and other European countries.\n\nThe accused then laundered proceeds through crypto currency transactions. People in the know told ET that Parvinder and co-accused received bitcoins which are nothing but proceeds of crime used for illegal sale of drugs in various countries. As per available information, the US authorities have already seized bitcoins valued at thousands of crores of rupees.\n\nThe US authorities had been conducting an investigation into the alleged involvement of Parvinder Singh and Banmeet Singh, both hailing from Haldwani. The investigation focuses on their alleged involvement in operating an international drug trafficking group, known as 'The Singh Organisation', said people in the know.\n\nET had reported on April 27 that \"this group utilised vendor marketing sites on the dark web, along with numerous free advertisements on clear web, to facilitate the sale of drugs. Additionally, they established a network of narcotics and controlled-substance distributors and distribution cells. Their transactions predominantly involved receiving payment in the form of cryptocurrency in exchange for drugs, which were then laundered through cryptocurrency wallets\".\n\nThe investigation carried out by the US authorities revealed that both Banmeet and Parvinder used common monikers on a variety of dark web markets such as 'SILK ROAD 1, AlphaBay, and Hansa'.\n\nThe US probe, which involved tracing withdrawals from dark web markets by the Singh Organisation and examining email correspondences with their customers, further revealed that the organisation received around 8,488 bitcoins using these monikers.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haldwani", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haldwani"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haldwani"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttarakhand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uttarakhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttarakhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anonymity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaBay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AlphaBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silk Road"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency wallet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109825399,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-68610,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539218", "eventUri": "eng-9539218", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 377, "textEnd": 385, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 643, "textEnd": 648}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

That performance at Stockbridge Golf Club earned Baringer a spot in the Massachusetts Amateur Championship in July.\n\n\"I tried qualifying a few times back when I was at home living in Michigan and never made it through,\" Baringer told Patriots.com. \"I thought it might be worth another shot - it might be cool. I found out that the Massachusetts Amateur Championship is not too far away in Framingham and that it was still during our break. It's just a good time for me to be able just stay competitive, and I had full support from everybody. It was really cool.\"\n\nBaringer, a product of Pontiac Notre Dame Prep, had a wildly improbable college career. He spent a year at Illinois as a walk-on who didn't play, transferred to Michigan State and landed a roster spot on a whim, lost his place on the team for a year, then returned to become arguably the best in the nation at his position. He was named Big Ten Punter of the Year and set records with the Spartans.\n\nAfter being picked by the Patriots in the sixth round of last year's draft, Baringer won the starting job and averaged 46.9 yards per punt with a long of 79 and 38 downed inside the 20.\n\nIn addition to being one of the best punters on the planet, Baringer is obviously a strong golfer. He traveled to Augusta National in 2022 to watch former roommate and Michigan State golfer James Piot compete in The Masters.\n\nBaringer's professional life is centered on football but it's the offseason and the Massachusetts Amateur Championship is July 8-12. That leaves him a week before hitting the field for training camp with the Patriots.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_Amateur_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts State Amateur Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-on_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walk-on (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Baringer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Baringer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punter_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punter (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Preparatory_School_(Fitchburg,_Massachusetts)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Preparatory School (Fitchburg, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pontiac, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pontiac, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Framingham, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Framingham, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Piot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Piot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/3YM5GPBQZJEF7G3ANOES6B6NYU.jpg?auth=47baae603ec7f5e43de652735aca70139ac885fd3afd67b401f78146d3c30a1c&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668326", "eventUri": "eng-9668326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "dateEnd": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 1876, "textEnd": 1885}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

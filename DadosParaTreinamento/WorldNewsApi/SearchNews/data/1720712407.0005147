The song backs England while calling out racism, and has been produced by the Sheffield-based Toddla T in collaboration with the Black Footballers Partnership (BFP). The BFP\u2019s co-founder Delroy Corinaldi says it aims to \u201cmove the country forward through a united vision\u201d to tackle discrimination in football and serve as a rallying call before England kick off in Germany against Serbia next Sunday. Euro 2020 ended in heartbreak for England, who lost the final on home turf after a gut-wrenching penalty shootout went the way of Italy. Three black players \u2013 Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Bukayo Saka \u2013 missed and were subjected to horrifying online racist abuse. The Birmingham-based Reid is the nephew of the former Aston Villa, Liverpool and England player Mark Walters and had been told of his uncle\u2019s experiences with racism while playing in the 1980s. After the Euro 2020 final Reid felt unsafe. \u201cI was feeling a little bit like: \u2018I\u2019m hearing racist remarks. Is this how people go on when we lose?\u2019\u201d The melodic refrain serving as the song\u2019s intro is Reid soulfully uttering the words: \u201cWe rise, we fall, we stand together.\u201d It is followed by a rapid-fire roll call of England players including Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Kobbie Mainoo over a garage-inspired, bell-and-whistle-laden anthemic instrumental. Amory, 26, agreed to the collaboration because his values matched those of the BFP. The abuse of Sancho, Rashford and Saka reminded him of what happened to Emile Heskey in 2008 when the forward was racially abused by Croatia fans while playing for England. Amory had just started watching football. \u201cWhen it [racism] did happen to me in another part of the UK, I was just like: \u2018Yo, if this is how I feel \u2026\u2019\u201d says Amory, who is from Solihull. \u201cImagine having a big, big weight on your shoulder such as the Euros. Feeling like they let the country down, not congratulated for even participating in such a high level of sport and representing England.\u201d Heskey, who has endorsed the song, played with members of England\u2019s so-called golden generation. The tribalism of club football defined that team, with representatives of Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea admitting that competing against each other in the early 2000s disrupted harmony. Since Gareth Southgate took charge, England have achieved their best performance at a Euros and he has been widely credited with an improved atmosphere in which players are unified by a common cause. Race has divided players in England dressing rooms of the past The BFP, which has more than 100 members, aims to help black footballers with their professional development, effect change in the game and guide the different communities that see the sport as central to societal change. They regard the lack of diverse representation in the sport\u2019s governing bodies as a serious obstacle to challenging discrimination throughout the game, however it manifests itself. Corinaldi says of It\u2019s OUR Team: \u201cOurs as in the whole country: black, white, brown coming together to help change the nation to be where we want it to be, which is with togetherness and equality. \u201cYou get, unfortunately, a cabal of people who look the same, act the same, went to the same schools and have continued to benefit for themselves and people that look like them. Whereas we are about the \u2018our\u2019. A diverse game has created massive results, along with a diverse England team.\u201d Reflecting on a society that remains as fractured as ever by the demonisation of minorities and with culture wars becoming a weapon of choice in politics, Corinaldi points to a bigger purpose. There are attempts in the song not only to rally this England team but to rally football and the world at large to confront existing problems. In the later part, there is the particularly striking line: \u201cDear clubs, we wanna see more black managers. Black managers are 41% more likely to be fired if there ain\u2019t a problem. How come them stats ain\u2019t addin\u2019 up?\u201d Corinaldi says: \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s very mono. There are no black executives at the FA, there are no black executives at the Premier League, there are no black executives in the English Football League. Therefore, even if an absence of diverse voices leads to wonderful messaging, because we can all do marketing [around anti-racism], it doesn\u2019t actually lead to the delivery of the change.\u201d Amory is hopeful that the catchy anthem \u201ctakes hold\u201d of younger listeners and that social media helps it transcend the line between popular culture and sport. The intention is not to create a viral moment but establish a consciousness among a generation of listeners who are young and energised enough to contribute to the solution. The hope is they have a quintessential summer-jam in waiting. But is it of the World in Motion/Three Lions vintage or will the annals of history condemn it to Diamond Lights by Glenn and Chris territory?

The Cambridge-born performer, real name Charlotte Aitchison, said some of her previous collaborators have thought of her ideas as \u201csilly or childish\u201d. Speaking to The Observer, she said: \u201cThe industry\u2019s changed a lot. I\u2019ve been told for so long that I\u2019m an outsider and I never really felt accepted into the British music scene. \u201cThe press has perpetuated that narrative of me. \u201cI\u2019m this girl who straddles the underground and pop music, and that, for some reason, is really difficult for some people to wrap their heads around.\u201d Aitchison discussed the influence of PC Music on her, a record label, which stopped releasing new music after 2023, that was known for putting out songs incorporating heavy use of auto-tune, abrupt tempo changes and experimental drum patterns. \u201cThus far any collaborators I\u2019d worked with had at points thought of my ideas as silly or childish, or not eloquent\u201d, she said. \u201cIt took some people who were willing to think quite drastically outside the box to make those ideas reality, and that was what I found in PC Music.\u201d \u201cPeople were so perplexed by PC Music, but it\u2019s unbelievably simple as a concept,\u201d she added. The 31-year-old, who has collaborated with the likes of Lizzo and Troye Sivan, also reflected on the role of feminism in the media landscape and said it has become a \u201cpopular marketing tool\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got past the point of the media always pitting women against one another,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the mid to late 00s, it literally sold magazines and papers: \u2018Britney versus Christina\u2019, \u2018Paris versus Lindsay\u2019. \u201cThen feminism became a popular marketing tool. \u201cIn the music industry, it was distilled into this idea that if you support women, and you like other women, then you\u2019re a good feminist. \u201cThe reverse of that is, if you don\u2019t like all other women who exist and breathe on this earth then you\u2019re a bad feminist. If you\u2019re not a girl\u2019s girl, then you\u2019re a bad woman.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just such an unrealistic expectation of women,\u201d she said. \u201cRelationships between women are super-complex and multi-layered. \u201cYou can like someone and dislike them at the same time; you can feel jealous of somebody but they can still be your friend; you can have the best time of your life on a night-out with someone but not be that close to them at all. \u201cYou can pose with your arms around a person at an awards show, but in reality you\u2019re feeling not worthy, or small \u2013 or really cocky, or confident, or a huge multitude of different emotions. \u201cOne day you can feel completely on top of the world; the next day, you can feel like your career\u2019s over.\u201d Speaking about her song Girl, So Confusing, which features on the track list of her forthcoming album Brat, she said the song is saying \u201csometimes it\u2019s really confusing to be a girl, and that\u2019s fine\u201d. The pop artist, who won the visionary award at the Ivor Novellos in 2023, also reflected on the expectations put on artists by record labels. \u201cThese days, labels are really desperate for their artists to be liked and the currency of niceness is really important in selling records, otherwise you\u2019re bad, evil and wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t separate yourself from your fans. Unless it\u2019s extremely drastic and distant \u2013 and then that almost becomes the culture itself\u2026\u201d She added: \u201cPersona is intrinsic to the modern-day artist, unless you completely reject it and do something alien-like and cold\u2026 I can\u2019t wait for somebody to do that, actually. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for someone to be really cold and mean and icy. But we\u2019re not in a place where any major artist could do that. I hope someone dares.\u201d", "summary": "The Boys singer said she has been told she is an \u2018outsider\u2019.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/charli-xcx-british-pc-music-the-observer-cambridge-b1161573.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/02/13/2e8a1475eaed68cf062e49ba53e45528Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3NDEyOTEx-2.72514440.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:31:20", "author": "Hannah Roberts", "authors": ["Hannah Roberts"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.205}

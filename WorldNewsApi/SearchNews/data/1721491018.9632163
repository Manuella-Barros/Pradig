The National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, has issued a heat advisory for most of the Granite State Tuesday, including Cheshire County, and is forecasting record-high heat across New Hampshire\u2019s southwest region this week. Local temperatures are expected to be in the 90s, with some areas feeling like 100 degrees. John Cannon, senior meteorologist at NWS, said Monday that people in Southwestern New Hampshire can expect a prolonged period of heat and humidity with hot nights beginning Tuesday and lasting through Friday. \u201cThis is the hottest weather in a couple of years,\u201d he said. According to Cannon, temperatures for the area are expected to peak on Wednesday and Thursday with highs of 96 and 97 degrees, respectively, and overnight temperatures in the 70s. Thanks to a combination of these high temperatures and humidity, the heat index will be more than 100 degrees on those two days, with no relief from cooling factors like wind, Cannon said. The state Department of Safety\u2019s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management is advising people in New Hampshire to take action ahead of the high temperatures. \u201cTake the necessary steps to keep yourself, your family and loved ones from experiencing heat related health issues,\u201d HSEM Director Robert Buxton said in a news release Monday. \u201cIt is important to stay hydrated and avoid the sun if possible. If you work or need to spend time outdoors, take frequent breaks and drink plenty of water. Make sure to check on neighbors, especially those who may be vulnerable.\u201d Buxton recommended that people stay inside as much as possible and find an air-conditioned space to cool off. Otherwise, stay on the lowest floor of a building and cover windows with drapes, shades, awnings or louvers. He also emphasized not leaving children or pets alone in closed vehicles. Excessive heat can have adverse health effects on people by putting a strain on the body as it tries to cool itself off, according to the World Health Organization. Inability to regulate internal temperature increases the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke and can exacerbate underlying illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma. The city of Keene is advertising a few locations to help people cool off. Deputy City Manager Rebecca Landry said the swimming pools at Wheelock Park and Robin Hood Park will be open from 1 to 6:45 p.m. Monday through Friday and from noon to 5:45 p.m. over the weekend. The Keene Public Library is available as an air-conditioned space, and is open Monday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The Keene Family YMCA on Summit Road will also be open as a cooling center to members and non-members alike. Its hours of operation are Monday through Friday from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 8 a.m. to noon. Brattleboro will also have cooling sites available, the town\u2019s fire department said in a news release. The Senior Center in Brattleboro will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., except for Wednesday, when it will be closed for the Juneteenth holiday. The pool at Living Memorial Park will be open daily from 1 to 8 p.m. Other sites include the Brooks Memorial Library and Brattleboro\u2019s Central Fire Station. The library is open Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Thursday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; and Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The fire station is open Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., as well as Thursday and Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. In Rindge, the town\u2019s recreation center will be in use as a cooling station through Thursday this week, open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. With many likely to reach for the switches on their fans and air-conditioning units over the next few days, this will mean a higher demand on the electric system. Eversource said it is prepared to respond to any outages that may arise. \u201cOur crews are focused on working safely to ensure reliable electric service for our customers year-round, especially during these hot and humid days when many customers will have their fans and AC units running in full force,\u201d said Doug Foley, Eversource N.H. president of electric operations, in a news release. To manage energy use, Eversource recommends customers keep their air conditioners as warm as is comfortable, adding that every degree higher on the thermostat uses 1-3 percent less electricity. Other tips include keeping air vents clear of obstructions and setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise and at a higher speed to circulate the air more effectively. This creates a wind chill effect.", "summary": "Local and state officials urge caution this week, with an incoming heat wave that will impact much of New Hampshire.", "url": "https://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/as-region-braces-for-heat-wave-officials-urge-caution-highlight-cooling-centers/article_a1575436-2cb9-11ef-98f1-476c728051a8.html", "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/30/130c001c-59d8-5dc3-a15b-d76f8c63f75d/66708c62aba5e.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:00:00", "author": "Hunter Oberst", "authors": ["Hunter Oberst"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.226}

commemorative event in Normandy on D-Day 80th anniversary", "body": "The King has arrived at a national commemorative event in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of D-day.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at the service at the British Normandy Memorial on Thursday, in which he said the veterans of the beach invasion in 1944 \"freed a continent and built a better world\".\n\nThe King and Queen are also scheduled to pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the event in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nAt the same time, an RAF band performed a marching display while Dakota military transport aircraft, widely used by the Allies during the Second World War, flew overhead.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt is the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Sunak said: \"Each of you who contributed that day - sailor, soldier, aviator, civilian - whether you fought on the beaches, or parachuted from the skies, or flew fighters or gliders, whether you were an engineer or a radio operator or an intelligence officer, your actions freed a continent and built a better world.\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything.\n\n\"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nHe said veterans had \"taught generations of young people about the horrors of war\", adding: \"Yet with each passing year, it falls now to those of us who listened in awe to your stories to pass them on to our own children and grandchildren.\n\n\"Because only by remembering can we make certain that the cause you fought for, that so many of your friends and colleagues died for, that great cause of freedom, peace and democracy, will never be taken for granted.\"\n\nCommemorations on Thursday began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nMr Sunak will miss the major international ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will mingle with world leaders at the Omaha Beach event.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThursday's commemorations follow an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office

that critical time\" as they both made speeches in France on Thursday.\n\nCharles, alongside the Queen, appeared emotional at events in Portsmouth on Wednesday and in Ver-sur-Mer the following day as they heard tributes to, and words from, servicemen.\n\nThe commemorations also presented the royals with a chance to meet some of the veterans, with 98-year-old Roy Hayward saying the King had asked him \"how I got on and how I had my legs blown off\".\n\nSome received updates on the health of both Charles and the Princess of Wales, with the King saying he is \"doing well\" and William telling one veteran Kate was getting better.\n\nThe final international commemorative event saw the Prince of Wales join a number of world leaders at a ceremony on Omaha Beach in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThe

in Normandy, as he spoke of his \"profound sense of gratitude\" to those who served in 1944.\n\nHe appeared emotional during the service, alongside the Queen who wiped her eye as the memories of one D-Day veteran were read to the crowd in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nAt a Canadian commemorative ceremony on Juno Beach, William thanked those who served \"for our freedom\", adding: \"All of you demonstrated

tribute to the \"remarkable wartime generation\", telling the audience: \"It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all who served at that critical time\".\n\nHe added: \"Our ability to learn from their stories at first hand diminishes, but our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nThe King wore his Field Marshal No 4 Tropical Service dress uniform with medals and decorations for the event.\n\nThe audience heard the experiences of Joe Mines, 99, from Hornchurch in east London, and Camilla

for commemorations in Normandy on D-Day 80th anniversary", "body": "The King and Queen have arrived at a national commemorative event in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nSome veterans of the beach invasion were helped from their wheelchairs to stand when Charles and Camilla arrived on Thursday.\n\nThey appeared emotional, with the Queen wiping her eye as the memories of one D-Day veteran were read to the crowd in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nThe audience heard the experiences of Joe Mines, 99, from Hornchurch in east London, and Camilla dabbed her eye before smiling with the King as Mr Mines waved his arms in the air.\n\nCharles sat next to French President Emmanuel Macron during the service and they could be seen talking to each other.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at the service at the British Normandy Memorial on Thursday, in which he said the veterans of the beach invasion in 1944 \"freed a continent and built a better world\".\n\nThe King and Queen are also scheduled to pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the event in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Macron.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nAt the same time, an RAF band performed a marching display while Dakota military transport aircraft, widely used by the Allies during the Second World War, flew overhead.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt is the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Sunak said: \"Each of you who contributed that day - sailor, soldier, aviator, civilian - whether you fought on the beaches, or parachuted from the skies, or flew fighters or gliders, whether you were an engineer or a radio operator or an intelligence officer, your actions freed a continent and built a better world.\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything.\n\n\"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nHe said veterans had \"taught generations of young people about the horrors of war\", adding: \"Yet with each passing year, it falls now to those of us who listened in awe to your stories to pass them on to our own children and grandchildren.\n\n\"Because only by remembering can we make certain that the cause you fought for, that so many of your friends and colleagues died for, that great cause of freedom, peace and democracy, will never be taken for granted.\"\n\nCommemorations on Thursday began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nMr Sunak will miss the major international ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will mingle with world leaders at the Omaha Beach event.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThursday's commemorations follow an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office said.", "source": {"uri":

arrive for commemorations in Normandy on D-Day 80th anniversary", "body": "The King and Queen have arrived at a national commemorative event in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nSome veterans of the beach invasion were helped from their wheelchairs to stand when Charles and Camilla arrived on Thursday.\n\nThey appeared emotional, with the Queen wiping her eye as the memories of one D-Day veteran were read to the crowd in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCharles sat next to French President Emmanuel Macron during the service and they could be seen talking to each other.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at the service at the British Normandy Memorial on Thursday, in which he said the veterans of the beach invasion in 1944 \"freed a continent and built a better world\".\n\nThe King and Queen are also scheduled to pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the event in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Macron.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nAt the same time, an RAF band performed a marching display while Dakota military transport aircraft, widely used by the Allies during the Second World War, flew overhead.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt is the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Sunak said: \"Each of you who contributed that day - sailor, soldier, aviator, civilian - whether you fought on the beaches, or parachuted from the skies, or flew fighters or gliders, whether you were an engineer or a radio operator or an intelligence officer, your actions freed a continent and built a better world.\n\nHe said veterans had \"taught generations of young people about the horrors of war\", adding: \"Yet with each passing year, it falls now to those of us who listened in awe to your stories to pass them on to our own children and grandchildren.\n\n\"Because only by remembering can we make certain that the cause you fought for, that so many of your friends and colleagues died for, that great cause of freedom, peace and democracy, will never be taken for granted.\"\n\nCommemorations on Thursday began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nMr Sunak will miss the major international ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will mingle with world leaders at the Omaha Beach event.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThursday's commemorations follow an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\"

moment of the beach invasion in 1944.\n\nRoyal family members and world leaders are set to gather with veterans in the northern French region to mark the occasion on Thursday.\n\nAt Gold Beach in Arromanches, Major Trevor Macey-Lillie paid tribute to fallen veterans, who led the biggest seaborne invasion in military history, by playing Highland Laddie as he came ashore.\n\nThe piece was also to remember a lone piper who played in the Normandy landings and was never shot at.\n\nMaj Macey-Lillie told the PA news agency he felt \"totally humbled and privileged\" by the experience.\n\nHe began in a landing craft utility before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nCrowds of re-enactors with their wartime vehicles, and visitors, had previously filled the area as the sun rose, with some writing in the sand and others cupping hot drinks as they looked out to sea.\n\nAfter the piper's lament, a French church service was held and military planes flew overhead.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was spotted coming down to Gold Beach ahead of the tribute.\n\nDown the coast from Arromanches, the Royal Marines of 47 Commando recreated a beach landing at Asnelles.\n\nAboard a landing craft, they waded into the sea while a piper played on the beach - paying tribute to those who took part in the invasion.\n\nSpectators clapped as the troops came ashore, some carrying wreaths.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the King and Queen will pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the UK's national commemoration event at the British Normandy Memorial, in Ver-sur-Mer, along with

commemorations in Normandy on 80th anniversary of D-Day", "body": "A military piper has begun commemorations for the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy by playing a lament at sea at the exact moment of the beach invasion in 1944.\n\nRoyals and world leaders are set to gather with veterans in the northern French region to mark the occasion on Thursday.\n\nAt Gold Beach in Arromanches, Major Trevor Macey-Lillie paid tribute to fallen veterans, who led the biggest seaborne invasion in military history, by playing Highland Laddie as he came ashore.\n\nThe piece was also to remember a lone piper who played in the Normandy landings and was never shot at.\n\nMajor Macey-Lillie began in a landing craft utility before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nCrowds of re-enactors with their wartime vehicles, and visitors, had previously filled the area as the sun rose with some seen writing in the sand and others cupping hot drinks as they looked out to sea.\n\nFollowing the piper's lament, a French church service was held and military planes flew overhead.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was spotted coming down to Gold Beach ahead of the tribute.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the King and Queen will pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the UK's national commemoration event at the British Normandy Memorial, in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt will be the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nTheir scheduled visit comes after an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales is set to attend the Canadian commemorative event at the Juno Beach Centre, Courseulles-sur-Mer, before joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official international ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office said.", "source": {"uri": "rhyljournal.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

King and the Prince of Wales praised the \"bravery and sacrifice\" of D-Day veterans who \"served at that critical time\" as they both made speeches in France on Thursday.\n\nCharles, alongside the Queen, appeared emotional at events in Portsmouth on Wednesday and in Ver-sur-Mer the following day as they heard tributes to, and words from, servicemen.\n\nThe commemorations also presented the royals with a chance to meet some of the veterans, with 98-year-old Roy Hayward saying the King had asked him \"how I got on and how I had my legs blown off\".\n\nSome received updates on the health of both Charles and the Princess of Wales, with the King saying he is \"doing well\" and William telling one veteran Kate was getting better.\n\nThe final international commemorative event saw the Prince of Wales join a number of world leaders at a ceremony on Omaha Beach in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak did not attend the ceremony in Normandy on Thursday but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer mingled with heads of state such as US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the Prime Minister's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nWilliam spoke to Mr Biden, Mr Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of the event.\n\nBefore the ceremony on Omaha Beach, Charles addressed the crowd of veterans at the national commemorative event in Ver-sur-Mer in Normandy, as he spoke of his \"profound sense of gratitude\" to those who served in 1944.\n\nHe appeared emotional during the service, alongside the Queen who wiped her eye as the memories of one D-Day veteran were read to the crowd in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nAt a Canadian commemorative ceremony on Juno Beach, William thanked those who served \"for our freedom\", adding: \"All of you demonstrated heroism, and determination, that ensured fascism was conquered.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches, who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nDuring his speech, the King paid tribute to the \"remarkable wartime generation\", telling the audience: \"It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all who served at that critical time\".\n\nHe added: \"Our ability to learn from their stories at first hand diminishes, but our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nThe King wore his Field Marshal No 4 Tropical Service dress uniform with medals and decorations for the event.\n\nThe audience heard the experiences of Joe Mines, 99, from Hornchurch in east London, and Camilla dabbed her eye before smiling with the King as Mr Mines waved his arms in the air.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Biden spoke at a US national commemoration in Normandy alongside Mr Macron.\n\nHe said: \"It is the highest honour, as Commander in Chief, to be able to salute you here in Normandy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales praised the \"bravery and sacrifice of the Canadian troops, who gave so much 80 years ago\" as he delivered a speech at the ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nHe was joined by Mr Trudeau, French prime minister Gabriel Attal, Canadian D-Day veterans and armed forces personnel in Courseulles-sur-Mer in France.\n\nWilliam, addressing veterans, added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nSir Keir said the national commemorative event in Normandy had been \"moving and powerful\", adding: \"My message to the veterans is 'thank you'.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations followed a ceremony in Portsmouth on

world leaders and D-Day veterans to mark the final international event commemorating the 80th anniversary of the beach invasion.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak did not attend the ceremony in Normandy on Thursday but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer mingled with heads of state at the event on Omaha Beach in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe ceremony followed speeches from the King and William, who praised the \"bravery and sacrifice\" of D-Day veterans who \"served at that critical time\".\n\nCharles addressed an emotional crowd of veterans at the national commemorative event in Ver-sur-Mer in Normandy, France, on Thursday as he spoke of his \"profound sense of gratitude\" to those who served in 1944.\n\nHe appeared emotional during the service, alongside the Queen who wiped her eye as the memories of one D-Day veteran were read to the crowd in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nAt a Canadian commemorative ceremony on Juno Beach, William thanked those who served \"for our freedom\", adding: \"All of you demonstrated heroism, and determination, that ensured fascism was conquered.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches, who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nCharles told one veteran he is \"doing well\" after being asked about his health.\n\nDuring his speech, the King paid tribute to the \"remarkable wartime generation\", telling the audience: \"It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all who served at that critical time\".\n\nHe added: \"Our ability to learn from their stories at first hand diminishes, but our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nThe King wore his Field Marshal No 4 Tropical Service dress uniform, with medals and decorations for the event.\n\nThe audience heard the experiences of Joe Mines, 99, from Hornchurch in east London, and Camilla dabbed her eye before smiling with the King as Mr Mines waved his arms in the air.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nElsewhere, US President Joe Biden spoke at a US national commemoration in Normandy alongside French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nHe said: \"It is the highest honour, as Commander in Chief, to be able to salute you here in Normandy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales praised the \"bravery and sacrifice of the Canadian troops, who gave so much 80 years ago\" as he delivered a speech at the ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nHe was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, Canadian D-Day veterans and armed forces personnel in Courseulles-sur-Mer in France.\n\nWilliam, addressing veterans, added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nSir Keir said the national commemorative event in Normandy had been \"moving and powerful\", adding: \"My message to the veterans is 'thank you'.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations followed an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats is scheduled to leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh joined veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester are set to meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-Day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and

attends final international event commemorating D-Day 80th anniversary", "body": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak did not attend the ceremony in Normandy on Thursday but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer mingled with heads of state at the event on Omaha Beach in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe ceremony followed speeches from the King and William, who praised the \"bravery and sacrifice\" of D-Day veterans who \"served at that critical time\".\n\nCharles addressed an emotional crowd of veterans at the national commemorative event in Ver-sur-Mer in Normandy, France, on Thursday as he spoke of his \"profound sense of gratitude\" to those who served in 1944.\n\nHe appeared emotional during the service, alongside the Queen who wiped her eye as the memories of one D-Day veteran were read to the crowd in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nAt a Canadian commemorative ceremony on Juno Beach, William thanked those who served \"for our freedom\", adding: \"All of you demonstrated heroism, and determination, that ensured fascism was conquered.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches, who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nCharles told one veteran he is \"doing well\" after being asked about his health.\n\nDuring his speech, the King paid tribute to the \"remarkable wartime generation\", telling the audience: \"It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all who served at that critical time\".\n\nHe added: \"Our ability to learn from their stories at first hand diminishes, but our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nThe King wore his Field Marshal No 4 Tropical Service dress uniform, with medals and decorations for the event.\n\nThe audience heard the experiences of Joe Mines, 99, from Hornchurch in east London, and Camilla dabbed her eye before smiling with the King as Mr Mines waved his arms in the air.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nElsewhere, US President Joe Biden spoke at a US national commemoration in Normandy alongside French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nHe said: \"It is the highest honour, as Commander in Chief, to be able to salute you here in Normandy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales praised the \"bravery and sacrifice of the Canadian troops, who gave so much 80 years ago\" as he delivered a speech at the ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nHe was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, Canadian D-Day veterans and armed forces personnel in Courseulles-sur-Mer in France.\n\nWilliam, addressing veterans, added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nSir Keir said the national commemorative event in Normandy had been \"moving and powerful\", adding: \"My message to the veterans is 'thank you'.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations followed an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats is scheduled to leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh joined veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester are set to meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-Day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada",

for the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy by playing a lament at sea at the exact moment of the beach invasion in 1944.\n\nRoyals and world leaders are set to gather with veterans in the northern French region to mark the occasion on Thursday.\n\nThe piece was also to remember a lone piper who played in the Normandy landings and was never shot at.\n\nMajor Macey-Lillie began in a landing craft utility before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was spotted coming down to Gold Beach ahead of the tribute.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt will be the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nTheir scheduled visit comes after an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales is set to attend the Canadian commemorative event at the Juno Beach Centre, Courseulles-sur-Mer, before joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official international ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office said.",

Just as strong together, 80 years later.\n\n\"Ensuring the memory of those who fought for freedom lives on is why we've come together again today - to say thank you.\"\n\nWilliam, addressing veterans, added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nCommemorations on Thursday began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak will miss the major international ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will mingle with world leaders at the Omaha Beach event.\n\nSir Keir said the national commemorative event in Normandy had been \"moving and powerful\", adding: \"My message to the veterans is 'thank you'.\"\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThursday's commemorations follow an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-Day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office

Just as strong together, 80 years later.\n\n\"Ensuring the memory of those who fought for freedom lives on is why we've come together again today - to say thank you.\"\n\nWilliam, addressing veterans, added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nCommemorations on Thursday began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak will miss the major international ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will mingle with world leaders at the Omaha Beach event.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThursday's commemorations follow an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-Day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office said.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

commemorative event in Normandy on D-Day 80th anniversary", "body": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said veterans of the invasion 'freed a continent and built a better world'.\n\nThe King has arrived at a national commemorative event in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of D-day.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at the service at the British Normandy Memorial on Thursday, in which he said the veterans of the beach invasion in 1944 \"freed a continent and built a better world\".\n\nThe King and Queen are also scheduled to pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the event in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nAt the same time, an RAF band performed a marching display while Dakota military transport aircraft, widely used by the Allies during the Second World War, flew overhead.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt is the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Sunak said: \"Each of you who contributed that day - sailor, soldier, aviator, civilian - whether you fought on the beaches, or parachuted from the skies, or flew fighters or gliders, whether you were an engineer or a radio operator or an intelligence officer, your actions freed a continent and built a better world.\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything.\n\n\"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nHe said veterans had \"taught generations of young people about the horrors of war\", adding: \"Yet with each passing year, it falls now to those of us who listened in awe to your stories to pass them on to our own children and grandchildren.\n\n\"Because only by remembering can we make certain that the cause you fought for, that so many of your friends and colleagues died for, that great cause of freedom, peace and democracy, will never be taken for granted.\"\n\nCommemorations on Thursday began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nMr Sunak will miss the major international ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will mingle with world leaders at the Omaha Beach event.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThursday's commemorations follow an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office said.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

ceremonies and events, paying tribute to those who served during the 1944 beach invasion.\n\nCharles, alongside the Queen, appeared emotional at events in Portsmouth on Wednesday and in Ver-sur-Mer the following day as they heard tributes to, and words from, servicemen.\n\nThe commemorations also presented the royals with a chance to meet some of the veterans, with 98-year-old Roy Hayward saying the King had asked him \"how I got on and how I had my legs blown off\".\n\nSome received updates on the health of both Charles and the Princess of Wales, with the King saying he is \"doing well\" and William telling one veteran Kate was getting better.\n\nThe final international commemorative event saw the Prince of Wales join a number of world leaders at a ceremony on Omaha Beach in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the Prime Minister's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nWilliam spoke to Mr Biden, Mr Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of the event.\n\nBefore the ceremony on Omaha Beach, Charles addressed the crowd of veterans at the national commemorative event in Ver-sur-Mer in Normandy, as he spoke of his \"profound sense of gratitude\" to those who served in 1944.\n\nHe appeared emotional during the service, alongside the Queen who wiped her eye as the memories of one D-Day veteran were read to the crowd in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nAt a Canadian commemorative ceremony on Juno Beach, William thanked those who served \"for our freedom\", adding: \"All of you demonstrated heroism, and determination, that ensured fascism was conquered.\"\n\nDuring his speech, the King paid tribute to the \"remarkable wartime generation\", telling the audience: \"It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all who served at that critical time\".\n\nHe added: \"Our ability to learn from their stories at first hand diminishes, but our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nThe King wore his Field Marshal No 4 Tropical Service dress uniform with medals and decorations for the event.\n\nThe audience heard the experiences of Joe Mines, 99, from Hornchurch in east London, and Camilla dabbed her eye before smiling with the King as Mr Mines waved his arms in the air.\n\nSchoolchildren presented veterans attending the UK's national commemoration event with white roses while cadets waved flags.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Biden spoke at a US national commemoration in Normandy alongside Mr Macron.\n\nHe said: \"It is the highest honour, as Commander in Chief, to be able to salute you here in Normandy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales praised the \"bravery and sacrifice of the Canadian troops, who gave so much 80 years ago\" as he delivered a speech at the ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nHe was joined by Mr Trudeau, French prime minister Gabriel Attal, Canadian D-Day veterans and armed forces personnel in Courseulles-sur-Mer in France.\n\nWilliam, addressing veterans, added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations followed a ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA Scots military piper has set a sombre tone for the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, by playing a lament at sea at precisely the moment the historic beach invasion began in 1944.\n\nRoyalty and world leaders are set to join veterans in Normandy today, to commemorate the landmark event.\n\nAt Gold Beach, Arromanches, Major Trevor Macey-Lillie honoured those who fell during the largest seaborne invasion in history, performing Highland Laddie as he stepped onto the shore, echoing the actions of a lone piper from the original Normandy landings who miraculously was never fired upon.\n\nMaj Macey-Lillie, speaking with PA news agency, expressed feeling \"totally humbled and privileged\" to partake in the remembrance. His tribute commenced aboard a landing craft utility before proceeding up the beach via a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nAs dawn broke, re-enactors and visitors, alongside their vintage wartime vehicles, gathered on the beach; some etched messages into the sand while others clutched warm beverages, gazing out to sea. Following the poignant lament by the piper, a French church service took place and military aircraft adorned the skies.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage made an appearance at Gold Beach just before the homage. Further along the coast at Asnelles, the Royal Marines of 47 Commando staged a re-enactment of a beach assault, disembarking from a landing craft into the surf as a piper played on the sands, saluting the original participants of the D-Day landings.\n\nOnlookers applauded as the troops disembarked, some bearing wreaths.\n\nThis Thursday will also see the King and Queen honouring fallen soldiers at the UK's national commemoration event at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer. They will be joined by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe memorial, inaugurated in 2021, pays homage to the 22,442 service personnel under British command who lost their lives on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944. This will be the first significant anniversary event held at the memorial, with Charles and Camilla officially opening the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning after Thursday's commemorations.\n\nMr Sunak will not attend the major international ceremony marking the D-Day anniversary, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will rub shoulders with global leaders at the Omaha Beach event. A Tory source downplayed the diplomatic implications of the PM's absence, noting that he will meet Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining over 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer. Thursday's events follow a poignant ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday, where His Majesty was seen possibly wiping away a tear during a tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nThe tributes will carry on with a piper leading proceedings on Arromanches beach, followed by a series of commemorations in the French town, including a parade for veterans, an air display, and fireworks. A service at Bayeux War Cemetery, France's largest Commonwealth burial ground from World War II, will be conducted by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nBack in the UK, a fleet of 80 vessels will set sail from Falmouth, Cornwall, echoing the departure of thousands of troops involved in the historic invasion, while Aylesford, Kent, will see a beacon-lighting ceremony.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh are set to attend a remembrance service with veterans at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, organised by the Royal British Legion. Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will engage with veterans at a performance at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\nThe event, titled D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be presented by Davina McCall and feature performances by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande, and Katie Ashby, the lead vocalist of the D-Day Darlings.\n\nAccording to the Met Office, the weather should remain \"generally dry\" for the duration of the commemorative events.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign

the Normandy landings and was never shot at.\n\nMajor Macey-Lillie began in a landing craft utility before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was spotted coming down to Gold Beach ahead of the tribute.\n\nA military piper comes into shore on a DUKW amphibious vehicle in Arromanches in Normandy, France, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the

along with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt will be the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nTheir scheduled visit comes after an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales is set to attend the Canadian commemorative event at the Juno Beach Centre, Courseulles-sur-Mer, before joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official international ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War

commemorative event in Normandy on D-Day 80th anniversary", "body": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said veterans of the invasion 'freed a continent and built a better world'.\n\nThe King has arrived at a national commemorative event in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of D-day.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at the service at the British Normandy Memorial on Thursday, in which he said the veterans of the beach invasion in 1944 \"freed a continent and built a better world\".\n\nThe King and Queen are also scheduled to pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the event in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAt the same time, an RAF band performed a marching display while Dakota military transport aircraft, widely used by the Allies during the Second World War, flew overhead.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt is the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Sunak said: \"Each of you who contributed that day - sailor, soldier, aviator, civilian - whether you fought on the beaches, or parachuted from the skies, or flew fighters or gliders, whether you were an engineer or a radio operator or an intelligence officer, your actions freed a continent and built a better world.\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything.\n\nHe said veterans had \"taught generations of young people about the horrors of war\", adding: \"Yet with each passing year, it falls now to those of us who listened in awe to your stories to pass them on to our own children and grandchildren.\n\n\"Because only by remembering can we make certain that the cause you fought for, that so many of your friends and colleagues died for, that great cause of freedom, peace and democracy, will never be taken for granted.\"\n\nCommemorations on Thursday began in the early morning with a military piper at Gold Beach in Arromanches who played a lament at sea at the exact moment of the invasion.\n\nMr Sunak will miss the major international ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will mingle with world leaders at the Omaha Beach event.\n\nA Tory source played down the diplomatic impact of the PM's absence, pointing out he will see Mr Macron, Mr Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other key leaders at the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and senior ministers will represent the UK at the international event, joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nThursday's commemorations follow an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office said.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [],

The King wiped his eyes as he heard of his experiences; the Queen was photographed with a tear glinting.\n\nThose 160,000 Allied troops, who assembled along the British coastline waiting for their D-Day orders 80 years ago, have now dwindled to a few.\n\nAnd those few are determined to remember.\n\nThe Royal family did their part on both sides of the Channel: the King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales at a service in Portsmouth, Hants, and the Princess Royal in Normandy, France.\n\nOn Thursday, all of them will be in France for the major 80th anniversary commemorations of that greatest amphibious operation in history along with world leaders, including US president Joe Biden.\n\nThe King, who has freshly returned to public duties while having treatment for cancer, is undertaking a slightly reduced programme, but spoke at length and with emotion from the stage in Portsmouth with the Queen by his side.\n\n\"The stories of courage, resilience and solidarity we have heard today and throughout our lives cannot fail to move us, to inspire us and to remind us of what we owe to that great wartime generation - now, tragically, dwindling to so few,\" he said.\n\nHe described how he had recently met veterans who remembered \"with such heartbreaking clarity the sight of those many soldiers lying on the beach, who drowned before they could even engage in combat\".\n\n\"It is our privilege to hear their testimony, but our role is not purely passive: it is our duty to ensure that we, and future generations, do not forget their service and their sacrifice in replacing tyranny with freedom.\n\n\"Our rights, and the liberty won at such terrible cost, bring with them responsibilities to others in the exercise of that liberty.\"\n\nThe Prince of Wales gave a reading at the event, delivering words from the diary of Capt Alastair Bannerman, a soldier who was part of the D-Day landings.\n\n\"Our guests of honour today are those veterans from the Normandy landing, that came from across our nation and from all walks of life to join in the fight against tyranny,\" Prince William said.\n\n\"Many of those that took up arms had never seen combat before, some were still only in their teens. In their letters and diaries we see their great strength.\"\n\nThe event, hosted by Dame Helen Mirren, mixed solemn memorial with music, with veterans seen waving flags and singing along to tunes including Dame Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again, performed by actress Helen George.\n\nThere were a series of reenactments dramatising the build-up to D-Day, including a weather report taken from a telegram at the time - now famous as being an essential part of the invasion's success.\n\nAfterwards, the senior members of the Royal family met the 21 veterans who had made it to the event in person.\n\nOne, 98-year-old Keith Whiting, had served with the Royal Marines on board the same ship as the late Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nThe Prince of Wales told veteran Geoffrey Weaving, 100, who asked whether his wife the Princess is \"getting any better\", that \"she is\", adding: \"She'd love to be here today.\"\n\nRoy Hayward, 98, who served as a reserve tank crewman and landed on Gold Beach, said of the service: \"It made me feel reminiscent and it has made me think of all the people who didn't come back.\"\n\nOther veterans had made the journey across the Channel to Normandy, where they will on Thursday attend the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer: one of multiple ceremonies for the Allied countries which took part in Operation Overlord.\n\nPrincess Anne travelled a day before her older brother, for a series of services on June 5 including the unveiling of a new statue commemorating the Royal Regina Rifles and the annual Royal British Legion service of commemoration at the Bayeux War Cemetery.\n\nShe paid tribute to the \"loyalty, bravery and duty\" of forces in the Second World War and, speaking in English and French, called on the public to \"never forget the sacrifices and determination\".\n\nAt the Bayeux War Cemetery, with its neat lines of immaculately-tended graves, she spoke to more than a dozen British servicemen who saw action on D-Day.\n\nSome, at the age of 100, insisted on standing to chat, as Princess Anne shouted to be heard over the buzz of conversation and a military band playing outside.\n\nShe told one the weather has proved the \"perfect conditions for it\", holding hands with several in turn as she made her way around the tables.\n\nJack Mortimer, 100, from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps landed on Sword Beach at the age of 20, driving as shells and mortar flew overhead and eventually advancing to Caen.\n\nPointing to the cemetery, the largest Commonwealth War Graves Commission of the Second World War in France, he told the Princess: \"The main reason I'm here is those men out there.\"\n\nWith a twinkle in his eye, he also tried out one of his best chat up lines on her, leaving her in gales of laughter before reassuring her, \"I'm not going to kiss you\".\n\nThe Princess told Donald Jones, 99, who landed at 8am on D-Day as a Royal Navy gunner on a landing craft tank that she does her job \"to meet people like you\".\n\nRichard Trelease, 99, a Royal Navy radar operator and navigator, was among those who insisted on standing to talk to the Princess. She remarked, smiling, on the \"standards\".\n\n\"We're not going to live a lot longer,\" he said afterwards, when asked why he came back for the anniversary. \"Therefore it's the right thing to come and see the beaches again.\"\n\nThe Princess went on to a service at Bayeux Cathedral, and back to the cemetery for a late-night vigil as president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\n\"Imagine the nervous trepidation of those allied sailors, soldiers and airmen who, 80 years ago today, were charged with storming the Normandy coastline and beginning the campaign to free Western Europe from Nazi tyranny,\" she said.\n\n\"80 years on, let their memory still live on in our hearts.\"\n\nIn the skies above Sannerville, in Normandy, some 400 British, Belgian and US paratroopers recreated the jump made 80 years ago for the airborne liberation of Normandy.\n\nThey included the first British female paratrooper to be included in the D-Day commemorations, 22-year-old Lance Corporal Addy Carter, of 16 Medical Regiment.\n\n\"To be able to be a part of history, especially on the 80th anniversary, is amazing,\" she said, adding she felt \"honoured\" to play her part.\n\nSgt Danny Mawson, a reservist with 4 para, jumped into Sannerville with a stuffed toy chicken called Myrtle tucked into his zip-up canvas bag.\n\nIt was in memory of Lieut Joseph Glover, of the 10th parachute battalion, who in 1944 began jumping with the real-life Myrtle stowed inside his canvas bag, to settle an argument with a soldier who insisted chickens could not fly.\n\nOver the course of a few months, Myrtle completed six jumps, with Lieut Glover releasing her at varying distances from the ground, until she was awarded her parachute wings, which she wore around her neck on a plastic band.\n\nAnother 11 veterans, travelling with the Spirit of Normandy Trust, took part in a service of remembrance at Colleville-Montgomery.\n\nRoyal Navy veteran Alec Penstone, 99, who served on HMS Campania, said: \"I'm surprised I'm still here, I didn't expect to be. I'm very lucky.\n\n\"I realised how many of my wonderful shipmates... died. I don't know how I'm still spared.\"\n\nBack in Portsmouth, one veteran thanked the Prince of Wales for the Royal family being there to show their support.\n\n\"No,\" said William, \"we're here to thank you.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the main commemorations will begin, demonstrating to those remaining few D-Day heroes what their actions 80 years ago have meant to the world.\n\n\"We are all,\" said the King, \"eternally, in their debt.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Victoria Ward, Deputy Royal Editor, in Portsmouth; and Danielle Sheridan, Defence Editor in Normandy", "source": {"uri":

begins commemorations in Normandy on 80th anniversary of D-Day", "body": "Royals and world leaders are set to gather in the northern French region on Thursday.\n\nA military piper has begun commemorations for the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy by playing a lament at sea at the exact moment of the beach invasion in 1944.\n\nRoyals and world leaders are set to gather with veterans in the northern French region to mark the occasion on Thursday.\n\nAt Gold Beach in Arromanches, Major Trevor Macey-Lillie paid tribute to fallen veterans, who led the biggest seaborne invasion in military history, by playing Highland Laddie as he came ashore.\n\nThe piece was also to remember a lone piper who played in the Normandy landings and was never shot at.\n\nMajor Macey-Lillie began in a landing craft utility before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was spotted coming down to Gold Beach ahead of the tribute.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the King and Queen will pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the UK's national commemoration event at the British Normandy Memorial, in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt will be the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nTheir scheduled visit comes after an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales is set to attend the Canadian commemorative event at the Juno Beach Centre, Courseulles-sur-Mer, before joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official international ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nIn the UK, an 80-strong flotilla of boats will leave from Falmouth, Cornwall, where thousands of troops departed to take part in the invasion, while a beacon-lighting ceremony will take place in Aylesford, Kent.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet veterans at a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe event, D-day 80: Remembering The Normandy Landings, will be hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-Day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be \"generally dry\" during the commemorations, the Met Office said.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire

War II veterans from Britain, the United States and Canada are in Normandy this week to mark 80 years since the D-Day landings that helped lead to Hitler's defeat.\n\nJoining anniversary events in Normandy on Thursday will be US President Joe Biden, who will commemorate the millions of young service members who answered the call to defend their countries' in WWII.\n\nThe commemorations kicked off early in the morning with a military piper playing a lament at sea at the exact moment of the beach invasion in 1944.\n\nAt Gold Beach in Arromanches, Major Trevor Macey-Lillie paid tribute to fallen veterans, who led the biggest seaborne invasion in military history, by playing Highland Laddie as he came ashore.\n\nThe piece was also to remember a lone piper who played in the Normandy landings and was never shot at.\n\nMajor Macey-Lillie began in a landing craft utility before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was spotted coming down to Gold Beach ahead of the tribute.\n\nOn Wednesday, both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer muted their efforts on the General Election campaign trail, attending the UK's national commemoration event in Portsmouth alongside members of the royal family and armed forces veterans.\n\nAcross the channel, the Princess Royal paid tribute to British D-Day veterans, telling one he was the reason she performed her public role.\n\nPrincess Anne joined veterans and their families at the Royal British Legion's (RBL) poignant service of commemoration at Bayeux War Cemetery, where the congregation was surrounded by the manicured graves of more than 4,000 military casualties.\n\nLater she took part in a solemn vigil in the cemetery, and described \"the nervous trepidation of those allied sailors, soldiers and airmen who, 80 years ago today, were charged with storming the Normandy coastline and beginning the campaign to free western Europe from Nazi tyranny\".\n\nIt comes after hundreds of armed forces personnel parachuted into an historic D-Day drop zone in Normandy earlier on Wednesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the airborne invasion to liberate Europe from Nazi rule.\n\nA brass band could be heard playing Vera Lynn's \"We'll meet again\", a defining classic of the Second World War, as paratroopers recreated the historic landing.", "source": {"uri":

We'll be back tomorrow to bring you all the latest from the second day of the D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations.\n\nThe Prince of Wales said his wife the Princess of Wales would have \"loved\" to have joined in with the commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day as she continues to recover following her cancer diagnosis.\n\nFootage posted on Twitter showed The Prince speaking to a veteran following a major event in Portsmouth on Wednesday, in which he appeared to say \"she is\" when asked if his wife was \"getting any better\".\n\nThe prince added: \"She'd love to be here today.\"\n\nHe told the veteran about how Kate's grandmother worked at Bletchley Park during the Second World War and was one of a group of women who \"never spoke about anything until the very end\", adding: \"It was all very secret.\"\n\nSir Keir Starmer toured Portsmouth Harbour with Second World War veteran Len Chivers and naval cadets following a D-Day commemoration event.\n\nA member of a nearby group of tourists shouted \"Go on, Keir\", as the Labour leader left the jetty in an LCPV landing craft similar to those used on D-Day.\n\nThe craft itself was used to land commandos at San Carlos Water during the Falklands War.\n\nPrincess Anne has given a reading of a poem at the Royal British Legion Service of Commemoration in Bayeux.\n\nThe poem, At the British War Cemetery, Bayeux, was written by Charles Causley after he visited the site - where many of those who died during World War Two are buried.\n\nIt describes Causley's shock as he sees the sheer number of gravestones, and the age of those who died.\n\nAt the Bayeux War Cemetery, where veterans and their families have gathered for the annual Royal British Legion service of commemoration, the Princess Royal has spoken to more than a dozen men who saw action on D-Day.\n\nWith their medals pinned to their chests, and some wearing their caps of old, the former servicemen spent a few minutes talking to the Princess over tea in a tent.\n\nSome, at the age of 100, insisted on standing to chat, as Princess Anne shouted to be heard over the buzz of conversation and a military band playing outside.\n\nShe told one the weather has proved the \"perfect conditions for it\", holding hands with several in turn as she made her way around the tables.\n\nJack Mortimer, 100, from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps landed on Sword Beach at the age of 20, driving as shells and mortar flew overhead and eventually advancing to Caen.\n\nPointing to the cemetery, the largest Commonwealth War Graves Commission of the Second World War in France, he told the Princess: \"The main reason I'm here is those men out there.\"\n\nWith a twinkle in his eye, he also tried out one of his best chat up lines on her, leaving her in gales of laughter before reassuring her \"I'm not going to kiss you\".\n\nThe Princess told Donald Jones, 99, who landed at 8am on D-Day as a Royal Navy gunner on a Landing Craft Tank that she does her job \"to meet people like you\".\n\nRichard Trelease, 99, a Royal Navy radar operator and navigator, was among those who insisted on standing to talk to the Princess. She remarked, smiling, on the \"standards\".\n\n\"We're not going to live a lot longer,\" he said afterwards, when asked why he came back for the anniversary. \"Therefore it's the right thing, to come and see the beaches again.\"\n\nEmotional D-Day veterans have spoken of how the national commemoration of the Normandy landings left them in tears as they remembered those who lost their lives.\n\nA total of 21 veterans had a chance to meet the King, Queen, Prince of Wales and Prime Minister at the conclusion of the event held in Portsmouth.\n\nRoy Hayward, 98, who served as a reserve tank crewman and landed on Gold Beach, received a standing ovation when he appeared on stage during the show.\n\nAfter meeting members of the royal family, he said: \"I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them, I thought they were super actually, I was most impressed by the way they chatted to me and were so friendly.\n\n\"They asked me how I got on and how I had my legs blown off.\n\n\"I lost both of my legs but that's nothing in comparison with what happened to other people and that's always the attitude I've had.\"\n\n\"It made me feel reminiscent and it has made me think of all the people who didn't come back.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, who commemorated French resistance fighters in Brittany earlier today, has arrived at a ceremony in Saint-L\u00f4, Normandy.\n\nThe town was almost entirely destroyed by Allied bombardments during D-Day and the Battle of Normandy.\n\nMr Macron is expected to pay tribute to the civilians that were killed there.\n\nA British female paratrooper has jumped into Normandy to commemorate D-Day for the first time.\n\nLance Corporal Addy Carter, of 16 Medical Regiment, was among the hundreds of paratroopers who dropped into Sannerville this afternoon to mark 80 years since the Normandy beach landings.\n\nLance Corporal Carter, 22, told The Telegraph it felt \"phenomenal\" to be the first woman to make such a jump.\n\n\"To be able to be a part of history, especially on the 80th anniversary, is amazing,\" she said, adding she felt \"honoured\" to play her part.\n\nIn 2022 Lance Corporal Carter became the first female soldier to pass the All Arms Pre Parachute Selection, known as P Company.\n\nShe said that since she achievement she has had lots of female soldiers contacting her for advice on how to pass the selection process.\n\nAsked what has held female soldiers back in the past, Lance Corporal Carter said: \"I think it's just the stigma of people think, you know, women shouldn't be paratroopers, they shouldn't be jumping. So, you know, to be able to set that standard and show the men that you know, the girls can do it, we can pass.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think since then I have seen an increase of females attempting the course.\"\n\nKeith Whiting, 98, who served with the Royal Marines, said that he was able to share a joke with the King and told him that he had served on the same ship as his father, the late Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nHe said: \"It was marvelous, we shared two or three jokes, I served on board the HMS Ramillies when Prince Philip was on there, so we talked about one or two things.\n\n\"It was such a marvelous turnout.\"\n\nBetty Withers, 99, was WRNS cook on Hayling Island who served a final meal to troops before they departed on D-Day.\n\nShe said: \"I still remember the faces of the lads the day they went. We knew that something was happening so we had to get everything ready for them. It's my sad thought that I gave some of the lads their last meal.\"\n\nChristian Lamb, a Wren officer working at Combined Operations HQ in Whitehall, helped to plan the Normandy Landings from Winston Churchill's secret war rooms, creating large scale maps to help those landing there to navigate their surroundings.\n\nChristian, who will turn 104 on 19th July, said of the event: \"I loved it, it was great fun. I managed to see the King and Queen and Prince William and it was nice to talk to them.\"\n\nRecalling D-Day, she said: \"I was in London and I turned on my radio. I had known for ages that something was going to happen. I was terribly excited and waiting for the moment. I was making the maps for them to land... so people could identify where they were.\"\n\nChristian, an author and plant historian, said of meeting the King and Queen: \"He was very friendly. I talked to his wife. And I said to her that her name was like my favourite flower, the Camellia and she said she liked them too.\"\n\nShe was accompanied by her daughter Felicity Rollo, 80, and the pair later travelled on to the commemorations in Normandy by helicopter.\n\nAround 10 veterans and their families enjoyed lunch in the VVIP tent after the Southsea ceremony, where they were joined by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty, defence secretary Grant Shapps and veterans minister Johnny Mercer.\n\nVera Brett, 99, who was a 19-year-old Wren based in Portsmouth on D-Day, helped to develop a radar controlled gunnery at nearby Eastney.\n\n\"It has been a fantastic day. It's something I never thought would happen,\" she said. \"I was only an ordinary Jenny Wren.\"\n\nShe said of her meeting with the King: \"He was charming, so lovely. They all were. They are so relaxed compared to how they used to be in the old days.\"\n\nShe added of the event: \"It made me cry. I can sing Vera Lynn songs still.\"\n\nSome 11 veterans with the Spirit of Normandy Trust joined commemorations in Colleville-Montgomery today, sitting in the front row of the service with blankets on their laps.\n\nRoyal Navy veteran Alec Penstone, who served on HMS Campania, said: \"I'm surprised I'm still here, I didn't expect to be. I'm very lucky.\"\n\nAbout the ceremony, the 99-year-old said: \"I realised how many of my wonderful shipmates... died. I don't know how I'm still spared.\"\n\nSgt Danny Mawson, a reservist with 4 para, jumped into Sannerville this afternoon with a chicken teddy called Myrtle tucked into his zip-up canvas bag.\n\nIt was in memory of lieutenant Joseph Glover, of the 10th parachute battalion, who in 1944 began jumping with the real-life Myrtle stowed inside his canvas bag, off the back of an argument with a soldier who insisted chickens could not fly.\n\nOver the course of a few months, Myrtle ended up completing six jumps - with lieutenant Glover releasing her from his canvas bag at varying distances from the ground.\n\nThe highest drop she completed was 300 feet.\n\nAfter she landed, she would loyally wait on the ground for Glover to collect her once he had completed his jump.\n\nHaving completed the assigned number of drops, Myrtle was awarded her parachute wings, which she wore around her neck on a plastic band.\n\nIt is exactly these kind of stories that Sgt Mawson, 37, believes need to be told to keep the memory of WW2 and D-Day alive.\n\n\"Younger generations don't have a deep understanding of what went on here,\" Sgt Mawson said, gesturing around the field in Sannerville as soldiers parachuted to the ground.\n\n\"If they hadn't done what they did - there are things happening around the world today that could turn into what happened before, so that's why it's important to have the awareness of it.\"\n\nAs for Myrtle, eventually lieutenant Glover took her on Operation Market Garden in his pack, which was fought in the Netherlands, but she was killed in battle. Soldiers buried her on the battlefield that same day in September 1944.\n\nOne veteran told William he was on Juno beach and described it as \"carnage\".\n\nThe D-Day hero asked William if the Princess of Wales was \"getting better\".\n\nWilliam said: \"She'd have loved to be here.\"\n\nThe Princess is away from public duties while she undergoes treatment for cancer.\n\nSpeaking to another veteran, called Norman, William said: \"We want you here five years time for the 85th.\"\n\nThe Princess Royal has paid tribute to the \"loyalty, bravery and duty\" of Canadian forces in the Second World War, as she unveiled a statue to honour them in Normandy today.\n\nThe Princess, speaking in English and French, called on the public to \"never forget the sacrifices and determination\" of the Royal Regina Rifles ahead of the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nSpeaking of the moment, 80 years ago, when they assembled across the Channel awaiting the largest amphibious invasion in history, the Princess said: \"One can only imagine the sense of trepidation; anticipation and probably fear of the unknown.\"\n\nIn a section of her speech delivered in French, she described their \"monumental effort\" and \"unwavering determination\".\n\nThe Princess added that she was \"grateful for so many coming\" to the commemoration event, where she \"unveiled\" a statue of a Second World War Canadian Royal Regina Rifleman that will \"tell the story of loyalty, bravery and duty\" for generations to come.\n\nShe was joined by Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence for a small outdoor ceremony to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the Royal Regina Rifles.\n\nWith three Canadian veterans, including just one surviving D-Day Riflemen, watching, she unveiled the larger-than-lifesize sculpture before joining a private reception with families.\n\nThe Princess has been Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment since 1982.\n\nShe and Sir Tim inspected the troops and the military band before viewing the statue. It had technically already been unveiled ahead of her arrival, with heavy tarpaulin being taken off so it was on full show for veterans during the event.\n\nAmong the 250 soldiers from the British Army's 16 Air Assault Brigade was Sergeant Danny Mawson, whose great-great-uncle Major William Tighe-Woods landed on Sword Beach on D-Day.\n\nAlso jumping was Lieutenant Max Phillips, a keen historian who wore a smock worn by Colour Sergeant Tommy Alderson, who jumped during the Normandy landings.\n\nNo Canadians are involved with today's drop because of an unexpected incident with their aircraft.\n\nSomewhat different to 80 years ago, as soon as the Paras land in France, they have to get their passports inspected before they can come and join the designated VIP area containing refreshments.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the King and the Prince of Wales chatted to the veterans who took part who watched from the stands.\n\nPrince William told them he found it \"very moving\" listening to the stories and the letters read out during the event, \"even now, 80 years later.\"\n\nWhen a veteran thanked him for attending, William said: \"No, we're here to thank you.\"\n\nHe chatted to another veteran about the D-Day landings, saying: \"it was a whole logistics mission everything about it was enormous; huge.\n\n\"We're where to say a big thank you to you and all your colleagues who didn't make it back.\"\n\nThe King asked one veteran how it felt coming back and reliving the stories.\n\n\"It's amazing how you've all kept yourselves in such great shape after all these years,\" he said.\n\nChatting to one paratrooper, he said: \"At least they dropped you in the right place. Because that's always the worry.\"\n\nThe King was told that the paratrooper would turn 100 in August.\n\n\"Well I hope we'll have your card ready,\" he replied.\n\nWilliam spoke to an elderly code breaker who worked at Bletchley Park. \"My wife's grandmother did the same sort of thing as you,\" he said. \"Catherine only found out about it at the end of her life.\"\n\nThe first troops jumped from an Airbus A400M , there khaki green shoots bursting into the air as they descended to the ground.\n\nThere was a brief moment where two parachute jumpers appeared to draw perilously close to one another, but crisis was averted, with the first airborne landings going off without a hitch.\n\nHundreds of Armed Forces personnel are about to parachute over Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nAs tributes moved from Portsmouth to the beaches of northern France, some 400 British, Belgian, Canadian and US paratroopers are set to take part in the jump, descending into a historic D-Day drop zone to recreate the airborne liberation of Normandy in June 1944.\n\nAttendees at the D-Day commemorative event joined together in a rendition of the national anthem before observing a gun salute.\n\nFrigate HMS St Albans fired off multiple shots as it passed Southsea Common on the Solent.\n\nThere was a brief spell of silence before the King and Queen then departed the event to more applause.\n\nThe crowd were then treated to a flypast from The Red Arrows, in formation and trailing the team's trademark red, white, and blue plumes of smoke in their wakes.\n\nRishi Sunak read an address by Field Marshal Montgomery, which was delivered to the troops ahead of the D-Day landings.\n\nIn his contribution to the commemorative event in Portsmouth, the Prime Minister read out the short address which began: \"The time has come to deal the enemy a terrific blow in Western Europe. The blow will be struck by the combined sea, land and air forces of the Allies together constituting one great allied team, under the supreme command of General Eisenhower.\"\n\n\"To us is given the honour of striking a blow for freedom which will live in history; and in the better days that lie ahead men will speak with pride of our doings. We have a great and a righteous cause.\"\n\nThe Prince of Wales paid tribute to the families who \"watched their loved ones go into battle\" as they left for the largest seaborne invasion in history in June 1944.\n\nAddressing the crowd at Southsea Common without the Princess of Wales, who is away from public duties while she undergoes treatment for cancer, the Prince said: \"We will always remember those who served and those who waved them off.\n\n\"The mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters who watched their loved ones go into battle, unsure if they would ever return.\n\n\"Today we remember the bravery of those who crossed this sea to liberate Europe. Those who ensured that Operation Overlord was a success. And those who waited for their safe return.\"\n\nAs part of a series of re-enactments dramatising the build-up to D-Day as part of today's commemoration event, actor Iain Glen gave a weather report taken from a telegram at the time.\n\nBad weather over the English Channel meant Operation Neptune, the largest seaborne invasion in history, had already been delayed for a nerve-shredding 24 hours.\n\nGlen received a round of applause for his stirring delivery of the weather forecast, causing host Helen Mirren to joke: \"He deserved that for the weather report didn't he.\"\n\nThe King has called on public to \"always remember\" the sacrifices of D-Day veterans, adding: \"We are all eternally in their debt.\"\n\nHe said: \"As we give thanks to all those who gave so much to win the victory, whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves to always remember, cherish and honour those who served that day, and to live up to the freedoms they died for by balancing rights with civic responsibilities to our country.\n\n\"For we are all eternally in their debt.\"\n\nThe King has paid tribute to WW2 veterans, saying it is \"our duty\" to remember \"their service and their \"sacrifice\".\n\nThe king said the stories of \"courage, resilience and solidarity, which we have heard today, and throughout our lives, cannot fail to move us, to inspire us, and to remind us of what we owe to that great war-time generation now tragically dwindling to so few.\n\n\"It is our duty to ensure that we and future generations do not forget their service and their sacrifice in replacing tyranny with freedom.\n\n\"Our rights and the liberty won at such terrible cost bring with them responsibility to others in the exercise of that liberty.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister has said \"we must never forget how much we owe\" those who took part in D-Day.\n\nIn a message in the programme for the D-Day 80 national commemoration in Portsmouth, Rishi Sunak wrote: \"Shortly after midnight on 6 June 1944, thousands of paratroopers began to drop from the skies above Normandy.\n\n\"A fleet of ships set out to cross the rough seas of the English Channel.\n\n\"By 0730, over 156,000 men from 14 nations were leaping from their landing craft into a storm of bullets, to take the beaches from which the allied liberation of Europe would begin.\n\n\"We gather to honour their courage and sacrifice. We must never forget how much we owe them.\n\n\"In their memory, we must create a country where all our veterans are treated as the heroes they are.\n\n\"And we must dedicate ourselves again to the moral cause for which they fought and died 80 years ago - the cause of freedom and democracy.\"\n\nComplete silence from the crowd as video footage of the veterans was played on screen.\n\nVeteran Roy Hayward was given a standing ovation and a lengthy clap as he was introduced on stage, before describing how his legs were both amputated below the knee but that he considered himself \"one of the lucky ones\"\n\nThe Prince of Wales read from a letter by Captain Alastair Bannerman of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, addressed to his wife and written in his diary on the morning of D-Day:\n\nThe Prince of Wales gave a reading taken from the diary of Captain Alastair Bannerman, a soldier who was part of the D-Day landings. The excerpt took the form of a letter, written by Captain Bannerman in his diary on the morning of the landings, addressed to his wife.\n\nWilliam said he was \"deeply honoured\" to join D-Day veterans in Southsea and to recognise the bravery of those such as John Haddock, who participated in the Normandy landings.\n\nHe said: \"Our guests of honour today are those veterans from the Normandy landing, that came from across our nation and from all walks of life to join in the fight against tyranny.\n\n\"Many of those that took up arms had never seen combat before, some were still only in their teens.\n\n\"In their letters and diaries we see their great strength.\"\n\nIn his closing remarks, the Prince used a quote from Rupert Brooke's poem, The Soldier.\n\nHe said: \"We will always remember those who served and those who waved them off.\n\n\"The mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters who watched their loved ones go into battle, unsure if they would ever return. \"\n\nThe King has spoken of his \"profound admiration and respect\" for those who took part in D-Day.\n\nIn a message in the programme for the D-Day 80 national commemoration in Portsmouth, Charles wrote: \"On 6 June 1944, following an intense period of preparation uniting military planning and civilian industrial ingenuity, nearly 160,000 young men landed under enemy fire on the beaches of Normandy.\n\n\"Each of these courageous sailors, soldiers and aviators risked his life so that others might live in freedom and in peace. Many were never to return.\n\n\"Eighty years later, it remains our solemn duty to continue to honour the outstanding gallantry, service and sacrifice of those who took part in that perilous mission.\n\n\"We do so with the most profound admiration and respect, and with everlasting gratitude.\"\n\nA big cheer went up from the crowd in the sunshine as a flypast kicked off the commemorative event in Southsea.\n\nThe jets flew low over the crowd from behind, sweeping over the site, behind the stage, out over the sea and round in a loop as a military band amassed on stage.\n\nElsewhere, Rishi Sunak received a rapturous welcome from schoolchildren who cheered and waved their Union flags as he arrived in the Royal Box. He gave a cheery wave in response .\n\nToday will be the biggest moment in the King's calendar since his cancer diagnosis, and he was determined to make it happen. The Telegraph first reported that this D-Day anniversary was at the heart of plans for his return to public duty before Easter, and today is the day. He wanted to honour veterans, and do his bit to ensure their efforts are remembered for a new generation.\n\nThere will be some tweaks to the schedule. Still undergoing cancer treatment and under the supervision of doctors, he will visit Portsmouth today before a morning ceremony in Ver-Sur-Mer, Normandy, for the French leg of British commemorations tomorrow.\n\nBoth days will be a little shorter than they would have been if he was in full health. The King will arrive later than the Prince of Wales for the Portsmouth event today, conserving his energy for the all-important part of meeting veterans.\n\nIn France, he will focus on the British memorial, leaving son and heir Prince William to represent him at the Canadian ceremony at Juno Beach, and the international ceremony with world leaders including Joe Biden at Omaha.\n\nThe King would no doubt be the first to underplay his own efforts to attend, in the face of the 100-year-old military veterans travelling in their wheelchairs to honour their friends.\n\nBut it will be an effort nonetheless, for a 75-year-old King for whom duty comes first.\n\nThe US president Joe Biden was greeted by the French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal as he arrived in Paris this morning to attend D-Day 80th anniversary events.\n\nThe president is due to meet his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is visiting Normandy for the today's commemorations.\n\nIn the early morning in Bayeux, a farmers market is bustling with tourists, the Gendarmerie ride slowly through the streets on horseback, and Union flags flutter from shop fronts and window boxes.\n\nThe small town in Normandy is preparing for D-Day commemorations, with temporary steel fences being put up to filter the expected crowds. A handful of middle-aged men dressed as Second World War- era American forces are already walking the streets in reenactment, in leather boots and caps that will no doubt see them greeted and thanked as veterans before people notice they are a good 30 years too young to have seen action on the beaches.\n\nAt the cemetery, the neat rows of gravestones marking the final resting place of those who gave their lives for freedom are immaculate. Tourists roam quietly, reading the inscriptions.\n\nShops and houses are decked out in UK, US and Canadian flags as a mark of respect to 1944 liberators. Messages saying \"welcome\" and \"thank you\" are everywhere, the town given over to a message of gratitude for heroics 80 years ago that changed the course of the war. The care and attention to the war dead, and the respect for those who served, is evident everywhere.\n\nFor veterans and their families, particularly those who remember lost friends and relatives, that care must be a great comfort. Their actions, and their people, are not forgotten.\n\nThe Princess Royal will join British and Canadian military veterans in Normandy during a series of events today to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nIn her role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Regina Rifles, a Canadian military unit who stormed Juno Beach 80 years ago, Princess Anne, alongside her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, will unveil a statute of a rifleman from the regiment and later attend a reception with former soldiers.\n\nDuring her day in Normandy, Anne will attend the annual service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral where she will read a lesson and take part in a procession, led by pipers from France, Germany and the UK.\n\nIt will return the royal to the military cemetery for a vigil where she will lay a posy at the Grave of the Unknown Soldier and give a speech on behalf of the nation.\n\nSir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are both attending D-Day commemorations today, as election campaigning takes a backwards step amid a host of events to mark the 80th anniversary of the historic landings.\n\nHello and welcome to our coverage of the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nThe King is due to give a speech this morning in Portsmouth, where he will be joined by the Queen, the Prime Minister, and over 500 military veterans.\n\nWe'll be bringing you all the latest updates throughout the day.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_British_Legion",

'Everyone was quite subdued, but it was all very matter-of-fact,' he had written. 'After supper we sat around making light conversation and listening to the chaplain playing his violin.\n\nAnne, The Princess Royal, President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, shakes hands with Cadet Corporal Grace Maddison as she arrives for the Commonwealth War Grave Commission's Great Vigil to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nA pipe band makes the procession from Bayeux Cathedral to the military cemetery walking in front of Princess Anne\n\nD-Day veteran Sergeant Richard Brock gives a reading during the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Great Vigil to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nBritish veteran Bernard Morgan, 100, salutes at Bayeux cemetery, on the day of commemorative events for the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nPrincess Anne, Princess Royal, President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, shakes hands with Cadet Corporal Grace Maddison (second left)\n\nPrincess Anne, Princess Royal, President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n\nPrincess Anne accepts a posy to lay on the Grave of an Unknown Soldier in Normandy\n\nPrincess Anne, President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, walks past headstones as she arrives for the Commonwealth War Grave Commission's Great Vigil\n\nPrincess Anne speaks during the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Great Vigil to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nThe Torch of Commemoration carried by Cadet Corporal Madison Grace at the Commonwealth War Grave Commission's Great Vigil\n\nPrincess Anne arriving for the Commonwealth War Grave Commission's Great Vigil to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\n'My cabin companion was a Captain in the Green Howards, a charming man who had been a solicitor before the war. We talked about what we would do when the war was over. Sadly he was killed in France only a few weeks later.' The captain, Raymond Chambers, was buried a few yards from where the Princess was speaking.\n\nYoung Symons survived the war, finished his Oxford degree, married and became a headmaster. Like all the veterans, no doubt, he would have regarded himself not as a hero but as one of the lucky ones.\n\nThis week's scenes are perhaps the most poignant D-Day commemorations ever staged here. Every June 6 brings the veterans and the families of the fallen back to the beaches and the bocage where the Allies began the painful and bloody task of liberating Western Europe.\n\nHowever, as the dwindling band of veterans are the first to tell you, this will almost certainly be the last time they come back in any significant numbers. That sense of a final farewell lends even more emotion to what are always very powerful events. There are thought to be up to 100 veterans here, including around 45 from the United States. In future, though, it will be the families -- the children of D-Day -- who ensure the torch of remembrance keeps burning.\n\nAnne, The Princess Royal, President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, attends the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's annual service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral\n\nThe Princess Royal speaks with members of the military following the Royal British Legion Service of Commemoration\n\nPrincess Anne views the war graves following the Royal British Legion Service of Commemoration\n\nPrincess Anne views war graves following the Royal British Legion Service of Commemoration to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nPrincess Anne accompanied by Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence attends the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's annual service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral\n\nBagpipers walk in a procession after a thanksgiving service to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nPrincess Anne attends the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's annual service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral\n\nPrincess Anne walks in a procession after a thanksgiving service to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nInternational pipers from France, Germany and the United Kingdom during a procession\n\nNormandy is hosting a variety of events at significant sites leading up to the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landing\n\nInternational bagpipers lead a procession to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nPrincess Anne lays a wreath as she attends a ceremony along with D-Day veterans\n\nI met many of them here yesterday, at some of the many enchanting little ceremonies ahead of today's big international set-piece occasions.\n\nIn the Commonwealth cemetery at Ranville, I spoke to Peggy Eckert, 92, from Hounslow. She should really be among the VIPs today, yet she has not been invited to any official event and has come at her own expense on a coach tour with her nephew, Keith. She has done so to honour her brothers, Cyril and Stan, both Paras who lie just eleven graves apart.\n\nProudly wearing a Parachute Regiment scarf, she placed a cross in tribute to her two big brothers. 'I do this for my parents. They never got over it,' Peggy explained, holding a photo of the two boys and a copy of the letter which Stan, just 19, wrote to his mother in the early hours of D-Day.\n\nDropped in the wrong place behind enemy lines and holed up in a ditch, he had scribbled: 'Do you know mum dear, I have never realised how much you meant to me until now. If I ever get home again, you will see a very different Stan. The same goes for dad.' The letter was found with his body and eventually made its way back home.\n\nHeadstones in Normandy dedicated to soldiers who lost their lives\n\nParachutes in the skies over Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nPeggy kneeling at her brother Cyril's grave who was killed at D-Day\n\nVeteran Don Turrell signs a commemorative book for a D-Day enthusiast\n\nMargaret Brotheridge and Penny Bates (left) at the memorial service in Normandy\n\nParachutes drop from the sky at the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nLights decorate the sky in the shape of a spitfire to mark the anniversary of D-Day\n\nDrones make a Spitfire during a drone display telling the story of D-Day above the coastline in Portsmouth\n\nPeggy, a child evacuee at the time, treasures the original, just as her mother did. It was months before they learned that Cyril, 22, had also been killed, in August at Pont L'Eveque. 'His comrades had carried him to the medical station on a door but they couldn't save him.' Peggy doesn't know how much longer she will be able to keep coming back but will do her best. 'It still affects me in different ways,' she says.\n\nA couple of hours later, I watched the Eckert brothers' successors, today's Paras, jumping over the very same terrain at Sannerville -- to happy applause instead of gunfire.\n\nNearby at Pegasus Bridge, the first piece of France to be liberated thanks to a textbook feat of arms by Major John Howard and the men of the Ox & Bucks, the grounds of the Memorial Pegasus museum were packed for a stirring drumhead service. Buglers from The Rifles sounded the Last Post from the top of the original swing bridge, now the centrepiece of the museum.\n\nDrones spell out 'I can remember' during a drone display telling the story of D-Day above the coastline in Portsmouth, Hampshire\n\nBlanche Boulet, 105, pictured at the memorial service to mark D-Day\n\nPeggy Eckert standing at the grave of her brother Cyril who was killed at D-Day\n\nBoth of Peggy's brothers, Cyril and Stan, were killed at D-Day\n\nCyril and Stan Eckert (right) who were killed at D-Day\n\nA plane drops parachutes in the skies over Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nA soldier drops among the crowd in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nPeggy Eckert visits the grave of her brother Stan Eckert who was killed at D-Day aged just 19\n\nServing members of today's Parachute Regiment were there to honour their forebears, including an ill-tempered regimental mascot.\n\nCalled Pegasus, he is a Shetland pony with his own uniform and rank of lance corporal (his stroppy behaviour, I discovered, was because he was not actually the real Pegasus; post-Brexit paperwork makes it too bothersome to travel with a pony so the Paras had borrowed a local lookalike).\n\nOnce the formalities were over, I met old friends Penny Bates and Margaret Brotheridge, both from Devon. Penny is the daughter of Major John Howard. After his men had landed in their gliders in the early hours of June 6, it was Margaret's father, the gallant Lt Den Brotheridge, who led the first charge over the bridge.\n\nA machine gun opened up and he fell, still urging his men forward as he died. He has gone down in history as the first fatality of D-Day. Margaret was born a few days later and never knew the story of her father until adulthood because her mother refused to talk about it.\n\nShe remembers living in digs as a young teacher when her landlord handed her a newspaper retelling the story of Pegasus Bridge. 'He said: 'There's this chap with your surname',' she told me. 'Then I started coming back here and have been coming ever since because I should have come long before.'\n\nShe soon started meeting her father's old comrades and it was like switching on a light. 'I wasn't that much like my mother but when I met all these men who knew my father, it started to explain so much about me.'\n\nVeterans keep warm during the memorial service to mark 80 years since the D-Day landings\n\nBlanche Boulet, 105, has her hand kissed in thanks by veteran Alec Penstone at the memorial service\n\nMargaret Brotheridge and Penny Bates (left) at the memorial service at the Pegasus Bridge\n\nBlanche Boulet (pictured) during the war\n\nBlanche Boulet pictured with other soldiers at the tea club during the war\n\nA statue dedicated to 'Monty', Field Marshal, Commander in Chief of the Allied Armed Forces, Normandy, 1944\n\nA veteran holds the order of service for the memorial service to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day\n\nBlanche Boulet, 105, receives a scarf from a veteran at the memorial service\n\nVeteran Ken Hay with other fellow veterans at the memorial service\n\nPipers line Pegasus Bridge for the memorial service in Normandy\n\nD-Day enthusiasts on their way to the memorial service at the Pegasus Bridge\n\nPenny Bates remembers an anniversary dinner when Margaret bravely stood up in front of the old soldiers and announced that she was Den's daughter. 'There wasn't a dry eye in the house,' says Penny. 'And Margaret's been part of the family ever since.'\n\nDon't tell any of these women that this is all stuff for the history books. The anniversary is always a challenge for Margaret and this one is no different. 'You just have to swallow hard,' she tells me.\n\nLast night, just like her father always used to do, Penny was at his original landing spot near the bridge just after midnight, reciting the speech he would give each year to spellbound crowds as he talked about 'taking the gliders down'. Margaret never attends this particular ritual, however. As she put it: 'I don't want to be listening and thinking: 'And ten minutes later, my father died....'.'\n\nHer annual tradition is always to go across the bridge for a glass of champagne with Arlette Gondree at her family caf\u00e9. Arlette still remembers, as a little girl, watching the liberators arrive on that historic night.\n\nSo, too, does another French woman, Blanche Boulet. 'I will never forget what I saw,' recalled Blanche, now a sprightly 105, when I met her at another charming ceremony in Colleville-Montgomery. The town was renamed after the British general and the service was taking place beneath his statue. 'It was bomb, bomb, bomb -- all night. I didn't sleep. And in the morning, we had 28 dead and many injured.'\n\nYoung Blanche helped administer first aid to the wounded and then volunteered to run a tea station for British troops in a local house, Riva Bella, even though it was soon attracting German artillery. She kept her 'English club' going for several months.\n\nYesterday, a small posse of British veterans returned the favour - with a Royal British Legion poppy scarf and a kiss.", "source": {"uri":

exact moment of the beach invasion in 1944.\n\nRoyals and world leaders are set to gather with veterans in the northern French region to mark the occasion on Thursday.\n\nThe piece was also to remember a lone piper who played in the Normandy landings and was never shot at.\n\nMajor Macey-Lillie began in a landing craft utility before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was spotted coming down to Gold Beach ahead of the tribute.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the King and Queen will pay tribute to fallen soldiers at the UK's national commemoration event at the British Normandy Memorial, in Ver-sur-Mer, along with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe site, which opened in 2021, pays tribute to 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nIt will be the first major anniversary event hosted at the memorial, and Charles and Camilla will officially open the Winston Churchill Centre for Education and Learning following the commemorations on Thursday.\n\nTheir scheduled visit comes after an emotional ceremony in Portsmouth on Wednesday where the King appeared to wipe away a tear during an event where he paid tribute to the \"courage, resilience and solidarity\" of veterans.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prince of Wales is set to attend the Canadian commemorative event at the Juno Beach Centre, Courseulles-sur-Mer, before joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official international ceremony on Omaha Beach, Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nFollowing the piper on the beach in Arromanches, commemorations will continue in the French town including a veterans' parade, air and firework display.\n\nBayeux War Cemetery, the largest Commonwealth cemetery of the Second World War in France, will host a service led by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh will join veterans at a Royal British Legion remembrance service at The National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will meet

Then HMS Diadem opened fire off the coastline of Normandy, clearing a path for those landing ashore.\n\n\"It was all such a blur,\" he told. \"We were action stations for most of the day.

How fortunate we were, and the entire free world, that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test.\"\n\nHe added: \"On the beaches of Normandy, on the seas beyond and in the skies overhead, our armed forces carried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination -- qualities so characteristic of that remarkable war-time generation.\n\n\"Very many of them never came home. They lost their lives on the D-Day landing grounds or in the many battles that followed. It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all those who served at that critical time. We recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades -- free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.\"\n\nThursday's commemorations began with a solitary piper on a Normandy beach before the dwindling number of D-Day veterans were joined by heads of states and those who simply wanted to pay tribute to the living and the fallen.\n\nPipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie was at Gold Beach in Arromanches and began playing his lament while still at sea in a landing craft before being driven up the beach in a DUKW amphibious vehicle similar to the ones used to land troops 80 years ago today in 1944.\n\nThe serving soldier said he hoped he had helped \"keep the memory alive\" of the men who came before him, adding that he felt \"humbled\" to be on the beach \"the same as those guys, those young soldiers many, many years ago\".\n\nThe performance was also in its way a tribute to one of the many individual acts of bravery on D-Day -- that of piper Bill Millin who landed with his fellow commandos on Sword Beach and piped them ashore armed with nothing more deadly than his instrument.\n\nThe sense of peace pervading the memorial events stood in stark contrast to the scene 80 years ago when tens of thousands of allied troops finally landed back in France, by sea and air, to begin to retake Europe from the Nazis.\n\nDown the coast from Arromanches, Royal Marines from 47 Commando recreated a beach landing at Asnelles. Their commanding officer, Major Andy Atkinson, told spectators that he had served in Iraq and Afghanistan but \"nothing compares\" to D-Day.\n\nDescribing how it would have looked as thousands of warships and landing craft filled the horizon and troops swarmed ashore, he said the men of 80 years ago would have been nauseous after a night of being battered in their crafts in the \"quite rough\" conditions of 1944, in contrast to Thursday's calm seas.\n\nTrying to bring the reality of D-Day home to those watching, Major Atkinson told them: \"Where we are standing now is smoke and fire\".\n\nThe King and Queen were joined at the British Normandy Memorial by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe memorial, which is on the site of the village where the British 50 Infantry Division landed, pays tribute to the 22,442 service personnel under British command who died on D-Day and during the Battle for Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nActor Martin Freeman read the words of Joe Mines, a D-Day veteran who landed on Gold Beach 80 years ago and was present this morning. In the message read by the actor, Mr Mines, 99, from Hornchurch, said he had come back \"to pay my respect to those who didn't make it\".\n\nHe smiled and waved to applause from the audience as Freeman concluded his speech and sat down next to the veteran.\n\nAlbert Keir, 98, from Derbyshire was among the first of the veterans to arrive on Thursday and he smiled and waved at the crowds as he was wheeled in.\n\nThe Royal Navy veteran, who spent D-Day ferrying US soldiers onto Utah beach, previously described the \"colossal\" noise of the guns exchanging fire and the sky \"lit up\" with artillery as he played his part in the invasion.\n\nMr Keir was one of 21 veterans brought to Normandy by the Royal British Legion. Among those paying tribute for what was expected to be the last time were four aged 100 or over.\n\nTributes were also being paid today by the Prince of Wales, who was set to attend the Canadian commemorative event at the Juno Beach Centre, Courseulles-sur-Mer, before joining more than 25 heads of state and veterans for the official international ceremony on Omaha Beach.\n\nUS president Joe Biden and German chancellor Olaf Scholz were among the world leaders paying tribute, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky also in attendance.\n\nToday an 80-strong flotilla of boats leaving

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressed attendees at the UK commemorative event, emphasizing the sacrifices made by those involved in the D-Day landings.\n\nWestern leaders, including US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, gathered to pay tribute to the veterans and commemorate the anniversary. King Charles III highlighted the \"supreme test\" faced by the allies 80 years ago and expressed gratitude for the courage shown during that critical moment in history.\n\nAt the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, wreaths were laid to honor the 22,442 British servicemen and women who lost their lives on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in 1944. The Red Arrows performed a flypast, and President Macron awarded the Legion of Honour to 104-year-old British World War II veteran Christian Lamb for his contributions to the D-Day planning.\n\nIn Canada, Prince William attended the Canadian commemorative ceremony at the Juno Beach Centre, praising Canadian veterans for their bravery and sacrifice. President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden met with World War II veterans at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-Sur-Mer, where they bestowed France's highest medal of honour, the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, on surviving veterans.\n\nAs the world commemorates the 80th anniversary of D-Day, it is a time to reflect on the sacrifices made by those who fought for freedom and to honor their legacy.

It's hard to overstate really how important it is for them that we remember and how important it is for us that we remember too.'\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla have led a silent prayer for D-Day veterans on the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings at the poignant service in northern France.\n\nThe monarch paid tribute to the 'remarkable' wartime generation and spoke of his 'profound sense of gratitude' to those who fought for freedom during the Second World War in an address to veterans at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nThe emotional service saw memories from those who fought in Normandy read out, sparking tears from those in attendance, which included Their Majesties, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nCharles, along with President Macron, Mr Sunak and military leaders laid wreathes of poppies at the memorial as Elgar's Nimrod was performed by a brass band in the background, with the national anthems of France and the United Kingdom also being played as the Red Arrows roared overhead.\n\nThe veterans in attendance were given a standing ovation by the crowd in recognition of their efforts, and recognition was given that their numbers dwindle as each year passes - at the 75th anniversary five years ago 255 travelled to France, compared to the 50 who have made the journey this time around.\n\nAfter their interview had wrapped Kate revealed that John had shared his condolences for the death of her husband Derek Draper\n\nThe monarch looked emotional as he listened to singer Johnny Flynn perform 'Song with no Name' in tribute to the fallen, while Camilla was seen wiping her eyes as actor Martin Freeman read a touching diary entry from one survivor who remarked 'it's because of the lads [who died] that I'm here today'.\n\nMr Sunak gave a touching speech at the event saying that 'only by remembering' can we ensure their sacrifice is never forgotten.

paying troubte to those who stormed the beaches.\n\n'Eighty years ago on D-Day, the 6th of June 1944, our nation - and those which stood alongside it - faced what my grandfather, King George VI, described as the supreme test,' he said.\n\n'How fortunate we were, and the entire free world, that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test.\n\n'On the beaches of Normandy, on the seas beyond and in the skies overhead, our armed forces carried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination - qualities so characteristic of that remarkable war-time generation.\n\n'Very many of them never came home, they lost their lives on the D-Day landing grounds or in the many battles that followed.\n\n'It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all those who served at that critical time.\n\n'We recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades - free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.'\n\nSpeaking in French as well as English, he also paid his respects to the people of France, who suffered under Nazi rule during the Second World War and who fought for freedom through La R\u00e9sistance.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Captain Bannerman survived the landing and the war, Prince William said, adding: \"Too many never returned.\"\n\nSpeaking to some of the veterans later, Prince William was asked about his wife Catherine's recovery and said: \"She'd love to be here today.\"\n\nHe said Catherine's grandmother had worked at Bletchley Park, the top-secret home of the World War Two codebreakers, and \"never spoke about anything until the very end\" of the war.\n\n\"It was all very secret,\" he added.\n\nDame Helen Mirren praised the bravery of the veterans in attendance during her introduction to the event at 11:00 BST, while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak read an address to the crowds.\n\nPortsmouth was one of the embarkation points on the south coast eight decades ago, as Allied forces crossed the Channel to liberate France and Western Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nFoundations for the Allied victory were laid by the success of the Normandy landings, in which troops from the UK, US, Canada and France conducted the largest seaborne invasion in history.\n\nThe commemorative event heard from those who took part in D-Day, including Roy Hayward, who landed in Normandy on 6 June 1944 at the age of 19.\n\nMr Hayward, now aged 98, said he wanted to remember those who had \"fought for democracy\" and \"to ensure their story is never forgotten\".\n\nLast week the King met one of the veterans of the Normandy landings, Jim Miller, who at the age of 20 had gone ashore at Juno Beach.\n\nThe King invited Mr Miller to Buckingham Palace to personally hand him his 100th birthday card.\n\n\"I am humbled to reach such a great number, especially when I think of those who fell on the Normandy beaches all those years ago,\" Mr Miller said afterwards.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, 21 veterans attended a memorial event at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.\n\nA further 23 surviving D-Day veterans attended commemorations in Normandy, where they were joined by Princess Anne.\n\nThere were 225 D-Day veterans able to travel to Normandy five years ago, and the Royal British Legion has said these \"poignant commemorations will be our last opportunity to host a significant number of Normandy veterans\".\n\nOn Wednesday evening, a joint UK-France thanksgiving service was held at Normandy's Bayeux Cathedral, which was illuminated in honour of those who fought on the beaches.\n\nThe King will travel to France for a commemorative event on Thursday at the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer, which will also be attended by the 23 veterans. The trip to France will be the King's first overseas travel since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nAn international ceremony with more than 25 heads of state will be attended by Prince William.", "source":

part in events commemorating the fallen.\n\nAt the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings the Royal British Legion (RBL) took 255 veterans back to Normandy on a chartered ship, while this year only 23 will make the trip with the charity.\n\nA total of 50 British D-Day veterans are expected to be at events in Normandy today, and there have been emotional scenes as those who are well enough to make the journey have gathered in northern France.\n\nCharles and Camilla, along with senior politicians, will be present at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, which pays tribute to 22,442

hosted by Davina McCall and feature music from the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, as well as Lulu, Katherine Jenkins, Emeli Sande and D-day Darlings lead vocalist Katie Ashby.\n\nThe weather is expected to be 'generally dry' during the commemorations, the Met Office said.\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said: 'It'll be pretty dry on either side of the channel.\n\n'It shouldn't hamper any commemorations during the day.\n\n'It'll be better weather compared to what they had then [in 1944].

they're no longer there].\n\n'When the veterans are there it's great because we can listen to them and we're kind of enamored by the veterans as much as the event.\n\n'But without the veterans, as we are now doing with the First World War, we can still talk about it and remember it and appreciate the significance and remember the veterans as part of that historical memory.\n\n'They [veterans] are so fascinating to us because they were actually there and in their heads are the real memories and all we can do is talk to them and pick this up second hand.\n\n'I think that's the great thing about talking to veterans is that you feel your as close to the events as you can ever possibly be.\n\n'You've kind of got a direct line back to those events because they were actually there and they were there witnessing and taking part in them.\n\n'So that's why we need to make the most of it while they're still here but whilst we're talking to them we need to store up those memories so that we can then share them with the next generations who don't have the privilege of meeting them in person.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

leaders and royals.\n\nSoldiers who took part in the Normandy landings 80 years ago wept as they remembered their fallen comrades and were given standing ovations by the grateful younger generations at a series of touching commemorative events in northern France.\n\nAt the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, tribute was paid to the 'remarkable wartime generation', before wreaths of poppies were laid in memory of the more than 25,000 soldiers who lost their lives in the first stages of the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nThe number of veterans in attendance was only a few dozen, as the numbers of survivors dwindles with each year that passes - at the 75th anniversary five years ago 255 travelled to France, compared to the 50 who have made the journey this time around.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla led those present, which also included Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron, in a poignant silent prayer to remember those no longer with us, while memories of those who were on the beaches 80 years ago were also read out.\n\nThere were also moments of levity, with Queen Camilla being given a white rose by one veteran in a touching mark of respect, with Her Majesty seen clutching the tender gift as she spoke with the former soldiers.Elsewhere\n\nPrince William was pictured attending at Juno Beach, where thousands of Canadian troops lost

Nimrod was performed by a brass band in the background, with the national anthems of France and the United Kingdom also being played as the Red Arrows roared overhead.\n\nThey were also presented with white roses by French schoolchildren while cadets waved flags, and received multiple standing ovations during the two-hour-long service, before shaking hands and exchanging words with His Majesty.\n\nThe monarch looked emotional as he listened to singer Johnny Flynn perform 'Song with no Name' in tribute to the fallen, while Camilla was seen wiping her eyes as actor Martin Freeman read a touching diary entry from one survivor who remarked 'it's because of the lads [who died] that I'm here today'.\n\nMr Sunak gave a touching speech at the event saying that 'only by remembering' can we ensure their sacrifice is never forgotten. As military planes flew overhead, Mr Sunak led the audience in giving the veterans in attendance a standing ovation.\n\nAt the same time, an RAF band performed a marching display while Dakota military transport aircraft, widely used by the Allies during the Second World War, flew overhead. There was also an emotive performance by Tom Jones of his song 'I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall'\n\nIn his speech, Charles said: 'Eighty years ago on D-Day, the 6th of June 1944, our nation - and those which stood alongside it - faced what my grandfather, King George VI, described as the supreme test.\n\n'How fortunate we were, and the entire free world, that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test.\n\n'On the beaches of Normandy, on the seas beyond and in the skies overhead, our armed forces carried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination - qualities so characteristic of that remarkable war-time generation.\n\n'Very many of them never came home, they lost their lives on the D-Day landing grounds or in the many battles that followed.\n\n'It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them and all those who served at that critical time.\n\n'We recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades - free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.'\n\nPrince William cut a sombre figure as he arrived at a service at Juno Beach, where thousands of Canadian troops lost their lives\n\nThe Prince of Wales paid tribute to Canadian troops who laid down their lives to ensure the defeat of fascism in the Second World War\n\nKing Charles shares a joke with French President Emmanuel Macron at the often-emotional service in Normandy this morning\n\nSean Bean pushes bouncer during night off from filming new BBC drama\n\nDad punches comedian for making 'sexualized' joke about his kid\n\nRollerskating circus bear hits back at his trainer in Russia\n\nSyrian gunmen attack US embassy in Beirut\n\nHere's what happened after Brazil's Marubo people got internet access\n\nWoman pronounced dead in Nebraska hospice care STILL ALIVE\n\nMan films himself speeding in Tesla Cybertruck\n\nMichigan couple discovers creepy room and tunnel under jacuzzi\n\nTrump makes stunning reversal in his election strategy\n\nMoment woman throws 2 puppies into dumpster\n\nUnusual fish discovered washed up on Singapore beach\n\nMTG says she's ready to start making moves for a Biden impeachment\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak gives a speech at the British Normandy Memorial paying tribute to the veterans of D-Day\n\nPrince William was pictured with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a memorial service at Canadian cemetery at Juno Beach\n\nSpeaking in French as well as English, he also paid his respects to the people of France, who suffered under Nazi rule during the Second World War and who fought for freedom through La R\u00e9sistance.\n\nElswhere in Normandy, Prince William paid tribute to Canadian troops who laid down their lives to ensure 'fascism was conquered'.\n\nAddressing Canadian veterans on Juno Beach, the Prince of Wales thanked them for their 'extraordinary acts of bravery and sacrifice'.\n\n'All of you demonstrated heroism, and determination, that ensured fascism was conquered,' he said.\n\n'The commitment to service displayed by Canadian troops is a great testament to the strength of the people of Canada.'\n\nCanadian troops were tasked with storming Juno beach, one of five attacked by Allied forces.\n\nThe prince continued: 'Ensuring the memory of those who fought for freedom lives on is why we've come together again today - to say thank you.'\n\nEnding his speech, he repeated his appreciation in French: 'Merci pour notre liberte, et merci pour votre service.'\n\nSean Bean pushes bouncer during night off from filming new BBC drama\n\nOver 250 homing pigeons get released to mark D-Day anniversary\n\nDad punches comedian for making 'sexualized' joke about his kid\n\nPro-Palestine SU student occupies president's office and list demands\n\nJonathan Tucker's heroic rescue of family during home invasion\n\nHere's what happened after Brazil's Marubo people got internet access\n\nWoman pronounced dead in Nebraska hospice care STILL ALIVE\n\nMan films himself speeding in Tesla Cybertruck\n\nAnti-Trump crossdressing man crashes car in county jail lobby\n\nShocking moment motorist hits man over the head with a rock\n\nUnusual fish discovered washed up on Singapore beach\n\nMTG says she's ready to start making moves for a Biden impeachment\n\nMilitary personnel stand in front of a giant poppy with the words 'lest we forget' and a Union Jack on Gold Beach as they pay their respects this morning\n\nMilitary aircraft fly over the beach at Arromanches in Normandy today as they travel over the northern coast of France to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nSean Bean pushes bouncer during night off from filming new BBC drama\n\nDad punches comedian for making 'sexualized' joke about his kid\n\nRollerskating circus bear hits back at his trainer in Russia\n\nSyrian gunmen attack US embassy in Beirut\n\nHere's what happened after Brazil's Marubo people got internet access\n\nWoman pronounced dead in Nebraska hospice care STILL ALIVE\n\nMan films himself speeding in Tesla Cybertruck\n\nMichigan couple discovers creepy room and tunnel under jacuzzi\n\nTrump makes stunning reversal in his election strategy\n\nMoment woman throws 2 puppies into dumpster\n\nUnusual fish discovered washed up on Singapore beach\n\nMTG says she's ready to start making moves for a Biden impeachment\n\nA house near Gold Beach in Arromanches is decked with the national flags of the UK, USA, Canada and France as the world pays its respects to those lost on D-Day\n\nEarlier in the day a lone military piper played on Gold Beach to mark the moment the first British troops stormed the Normandy coast on D-Day 80 years ago today.\n\nPipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie played Highland Laddie as he was carried to the beach at Arromanches on a Royal Marines amphibious landing craft flanked by service members at the exact moment the first troops waded ashore as part of the Normandy landings.\n\nCrowds gathered at the beach to view the reenactment, which harkened back to a lone piper who played during the landings itself and was never shot at, during a picturesque sunrise - a far cry from the cloudy and rough seas that welcomed 25,000 soldiers who landed on the same stretch of coast in 1944.\n\nAmong those present at Arromanches this morning was Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who joined others in paying tribute to those who lost their lives during what was the biggest seaborne invasion in military history.\n\nThere have also been events remember the British troops on Sword Beach in Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Canadian soldiers on Juno Beach at Courseulles and US forces at Utah Beach in Pouppeville and Omaha Beach in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nPipe Major Macey-Lillie, who also performed his role as the lone piper on gold Beach during the 75th anniversary, said it was a 'privileged, humbling experience' to take part.\n\n'We are here to represent and remember the veterans who are still here today and for the young soldiers of all Allied forces who didn't make it home,' he told the BBC.\n\nREAD MOREEXCLUSIVE 'It was the privilege of my life, I would do it all again': 80 years on since D-Day, hero war veterans who stormed the beaches of Normandy and helped change the tide of history recount their experiences\n\n'It was freezing cold out there this morning and last night. I was on the landing craft out behind the harbour looking up at the stars and thinking to myself about exactly what the young soldiers had thought prior to them coming onto the beaches.'\n\nHe performed to crowds of reenactors who gather in their wartime vehicles, and visitors, had previously filled the area as the sun rose, with some writing in the sand and others cupping hot drinks as they looked out to sea.\n\nAfter the piper's lament the piper's lament, a French church service was held and military planes flew overhead.\n\nFollowing the poignant remembrance on the beach, there will be commemorations in the French town including a veterans parade, as well as an air and firework display.\n\nThere have also been reenactments on other beaches which were targeted during D-Day, with a fellow British congregation gathering on Sword Beach to pay respects to those who lost their lives on June 6, 1944.\n\nThere are also events at Juno Beach, Utah Beach and Omaha Beach where heroic Canadian and US troops played their part in the Normandy landings.\n\nIn recent days veterans of the conflict, who are dwindling in number as the years pass, have travelled to France to take part in events commemorating the fallen.\n\nAt the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings the Royal British Legion (RBL) took 255 veterans back to Normandy on a chartered ship, while this year only 23 will make the trip with the charity.\n\nA total of 50 British D-Day veterans are expected to be at events in Normandy today, and there have been emotional scenes as those who are well enough to make the journey have gathered in northern France.\n\nCharles and Camilla, along with senior politicians, will be present at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, which pays tribute to 22,442

Very many of them never came home.\n\n'They lost their lives on the D-Day landing grounds or in the many battles that followed.\n\n'It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them, and all those who served at that critical time.\n\n'We recall the lesson that comes to us, again and again, across the decades: free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.\n\n'As the years pass, the veterans of the Normandy campaign become ever-fewer in number.\n\n'Over the past forty years I have had the great privilege of attending seven D-Day commemorations in Normandy and meeting so many distinguished veterans.\n\n'Indeed, I shall never forget the haunting sights and sounds of thousands of be-medalled figures proudly marching past into a French sunset on these beaches.\n\n'Our ability to learn from their stories at first hand diminishes. But our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all, can never diminish.\n\n'That is why I am so proud that we have a permanent National Memorial in Normandy, by which to remember the more than 22,000 service personnel in British units who gave their lives during the D-Day landings and the Battle of Normandy.\n\n'It was built at the suggestion of a veteran, George Batts. He is sadly no longer with us, but lived to see it built and explained on the day it was opened why it means so much: 'We left a lot of mates behind and now I know they will never be forgotten.'\n\n'So, for the first time today, we can come together at Gold Beach, the objective of the 50th Infantry Division, to honour those who fought on this ground eighty years ago, and who continued for three months of the war's fiercest fighting to secure Normandy.\n\n(Delivered in French)\n\n'This memorial stands also as a special homage to the greatest tragedy of D-Day: the unimaginable numbers of French civilians who died in this joint battle, for freedom, as the Allies sealed off north-west France to ensure a final victory.\n\n'We must never fail to pay tribute to the unbelievable courage and sacrifice of the men and women of the French Resistance, and many ordinary people, who provided vital intelligence, cut off supplies and communications, and laid critical ambushes.\n\n'The warmth and the generosity of the welcome which the people of Normandy have shown to the veterans of D-Day is the most moving and memorable part of these anniversaries.\n\n(Delivered in English)\n\n'This vital start to the liberation of Europe was a vast Allied effort. American, British, Canadian, French and Polish formations fought here in Normandy. Among the names inscribed on the walls and pillars of this memorial are men and women from more than thirty different nations and many faiths.\n\n'United, they fought together for what my grandfather, King George VI, described as 'a world in which goodness and honour may be the foundation of the life of men in every land'.\n\n'As we stand alongside their remaining friends and comrades on this hallowed ground, let us affirm that we will strive to live by their example, let us pray such sacrifice need never be made again, and let us commit to carrying forward their resounding message of courage and resilience in the pursuit of freedom, tempered by the duty of responsibilities to others, for the benefit of younger generations and those yet unborn.\n\n'Our gratitude is unfailing and our admiration eternal.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I hope you feel very good. All the best.'\n\nPrince William stepped in for his father to thank veterans for fighting for freedom as he represented Britain at the ceremony.\n\nThe 41-year-old is deputising for his father King

Camilla have decided not attend the international commemorative ceremony in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer which is 20 miles (32km) away, giving his eldest son and heir to the throne William a chance to shine.\n\nCharles led a crowd of 2,000 people, which included Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron in a poignant silent prayer to remember those no longer with us, while memories of those who were on the beaches 80 years ago were also read out.\n\nThose veterans in attendance were presented with white roses by French schoolchildren while cadets waved flags, and received multiple standing ovations during the two-hour-long service, before shaking hands and exchanging words with His Majesty.\n\nPhotographs also show William greeting Zelensky as they attended the ceremony on Omaha Beach earlier today.\n\nEarlier in the day William gave a speech at Juno Beach praising the actions of Canadian troops who stormed the seafront on D-Day\n\nPresident Macron and

gifted a pin by one veteran in the seaside town and saw others pass along their well wishes to his father, stopped at the French town's D-day museum following his speech at the Canadian commemoration ceremony earlier in the day.\n\nIn Arramanches William told a group of British veterans how 'moving' the commemorations have been as he made the surprise stop in the town.\n\nVeteran Julian Heal, 52, from Bristol, said: 'He [told us] 'it's all about the veterans', and people are getting older, and there's not many left on that, and he just said about how moving it was, especially the new monument on top of the hill.'\n\nMr Heal, who served in Northern Ireland, added: 'As a veteran it's really good because he gets us, we have a good laugh, real approachable guy.'\n\nIt comes as the number of surviving D-Day veterans continues to dwindle as the years go by, with fewer attending this year's commemorative events than ever before.\n\nAt the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings the Royal British Legion (RBL) took 255 veterans back to Normandy on a chartered ship, while this year only 23 will make the trip with the charity.\n\nAround 50 British D-Day veterans are expected to be at events in Normandy today, and there have been emotional scenes as those who are well enough to make the journey have gathered in northern France.\n\nD-Day veterans Albert Keir (second left), Stan Ford

command died on D-day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nNigel Steel, senior curator at the Imperial War Museum, said it is important to 'make the most' of having D-Day veterans as their numbers dwindle.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'The presence of a veterans is special for us and I think we do need to make the most of that because we know that it's only a matter of time [before they're no longer there].\n\n'When the veterans are there it's great because we can listen to them and we're kind of enamored by the veterans as much as the event.\n\n'But without the veterans, as we are now doing with the First World War, we can still talk about it and remember it and appreciate the significance and remember the veterans as part of that historical memory.\n\n'They [veterans] are so fascinating to us because they were actually there and in their heads are the real memories and all we can do is talk to them and pick this up second hand.\n\n'I think that's the great thing about talking to veterans is that you feel your as close to the events as you can ever possibly be.\n\n'You've kind of got a direct line back to those events because they were actually there and they were there witnessing and taking part in them.\n\n'So that's why we need to make the most of it while they're still here but whilst we're talking to them we need to store up those memories so that we can then share them with the next generations who don't have the privilege of meeting them in person.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

This time the challenge is not to fight to survive, but to fight to win the final victory for the good cause.'\n\nHe also spoke of the importance in remembering what the War taught us: 'We recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades: Free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.'\n\nHe closed: 'Our gratitude is unfailing and our admiration eternal.'\n\nRead More How

Macey-Lillie played Highland Laddie as he was carried to the beach at Arromanches on a Royal Marines amphibious landing craft flanked by service members at the exact moment the first troops waded ashore as part of the Normandy landings.\n\nCrowds gathered at the beach to view the reenactment, which harkened back to a lone piper who played during the landings itself and was never shot at, during a picturesque sunrise - a far cry from the cloudy and rough seas that welcomed 25,000 soldiers who landed on the same stretch of coast in 1944.\n\nSaving Private Ryan is considered to be one of legendary director Steven Spielberg's best films, and one of the best war films ever made, nominated for 11 Oscars and winning six, including Best Director for Spielberg\n\nThe film is set in 1944 France during World War II, following a battalion lead by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) to find Private James Ryan, after it was learned his three brothers had been killed in action.\n\nIt also famously opens with a glimpse into the mayhem on June 6, 1944 at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, which would come to be known as D-Day.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

have decided not attend the international commemorative ceremony in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer which is 20 miles (32km) away, giving his eldest son and heir to the throne William a chance to shine.\n\nAt the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, tribute was paid to the 'remarkable wartime generation', before wreaths of poppies were laid in memory of the more than 25,000 soldiers who lost their lives in the first stages of the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nSoldiers who took part in the Normandy landings 80 years ago wept as they remembered their fallen comrades and were given standing ovations by the grateful younger generations at a series of touching commemorative events in northern France.\n\nThe number of veterans in attendance was only a few dozen, as the numbers of survivors dwindles with each year that passes - at the 75th anniversary five years ago 255 travelled to France, compared to the 50 who have made the journey this time around.", "source": {"uri":

It saw tens of thousands of Allied soldiers landing on five beaches in Normandy, northern France - with the codenames Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword.\n\nThe operation was the start of the liberation of France - and, subsequently, the rest of Western Europe - laying the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front. The Neptune amphibious assault was supported by the landing of 24,000 US, British, and Canadian airborne troops. At the same time, Operation Bodyguard, a number of diversionary attacks in the Balkans, southern France, Norway and Bulgaria, were carried out to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landing.\n\nEvents to mark the 80th anniversary of that invasion took place today in France and the UK. Perhaps the most compelling of those took place at the site of the British Normandy Memorial in in Ver-sur-Mer, attended by 23 of the surviving veterans of that day 80 years ago, all close to or more than 100 years old. It was also attended by several Western leaders including King Charles, Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOther memorial events included the official international ceremony on Omaha Beach, in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer attended by more than 25 heads of state, including US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Zelensky and the event memorializing Canadian involvement at the Juno Beach Centre, Courseulles-sur-Mer attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.\n\nThe UK commemoration saw military pipers playing laments, a salute from artillery guns, massed bands playing arrangements of 1940s tunes, a fly-past of World War II vintage aircraft, a recreation of the assault by Royal Marines from a landing craft, the arrival of an 80-strong flotilla of boats from Falmouth, Cornwall and a beacon-lighting ceremony in Aylesford, Kent - both locations from which the 1944 fleet set sail.\n\nAs the British Prime Minister said: \"Each of you who contributed that day - sailor, soldier, aviator, civilian - whether you fought on the beaches, or parachuted from the skies, or flew fighters or gliders, whether you were an engineer or a radio operator or an intelligence officer, your actions freed a continent and built a better world.\n\n\"You risked everything, and we owe you everything. We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt, but we can, and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nBritain's King Charles said: \"How fortunate we were, and the entire free world, that a generation of men and women... did not flinch when the moment came to face that test.\n\n\"On the beaches of Normandy, on the seas beyond and in the skies overhead, our armed forces carried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination - qualities so characteristic of that remarkable wartime generation.\"\n\nThe UK's event ended with the presentation by President Macron of the Legion d'honneur, France's highest decoration, to Christian Lamb, a former naval officer who was involved in preparing the operational maps that were so critical during the landings.\n\nFor me, the most touching part was when the British actor Martin Freeman, best known as Dr. Watson in the Sherlock TV series, read out the words of Joe Mines, who was 19 when he took part as a soldier in the Essex regiment and the now 99-year-old veteran looked on. His memories included the words:\n\n\"Joe Mines, clearing mines. One of our fellows trod on one and blew his leg off. The whole leg went. War is brutal. I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\n\n\"Why would I come back you may ask. This is the last and only opportunity for me, the last there will ever be. I want to pay my respects to those who didn't make it. May they rest in peace.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type":

By nightfall, about 160,000 Allied troops were ashore.\n\nD-Day marked the start of the campaign to free north-west Europe from the Nazis' tyranny.\n\nThe best way to understand its significance is to appreciate what might have happened had it failed.\n\nWould the Allies have been able to secure an unconditional surrender by the Nazis? How many more lives would have been lost?\n\nDuring World War II, an estimated 18,688 civilians in London were killed, and 3.5m homes and 9,000,000 square feet of office space were destroyed or damaged.\n\nAs the policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, I spend my time promoting the strength of the Square Mile and the UK's financial and professional services sector.\n\nThe UK punches above its weight on the world stage, but I'm acutely aware that - had it not been for the bravery of those men and women who made D-Day happen - things could look very different.\n\nEighty years on, and there are estimated to be fewer than 100 British D-Day veterans still alive today.\n\nYesterday, their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla joined 500 veterans for the UK commemorative event in Portsmouth.\n\nCommemorations will continue in Normandy today, being the official anniversary, with some British veterans having repeated their deeply emotional journey to France to take part.\n\nBeyond the flag-waving and the fly pasts, it is their reflections that really matter.\n\nSpeaking to the Royal British Legion, one veteran, George Dangerfield, described the moment he landed on Juno Beach in 1944: \"That day saw me quickly convert from boyhood to manhood and yet it still breaks my heart every time I talk or think about those boys.\"\n\nE. M. Forster once wrote that, \"unless we remember, we cannot understand.\"\n\nThe Allied troops fought for a future that they knew they may not see: a future that we are now living.\n\nWe must listen to the veterans' stories, and as the last of them leave us, continue to tell them on their behalf, lest we forget.\n\nIn the words of Benjamin Disraeli - \"The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example.\"\n\nWe have inherited so much from the D-Day veterans.

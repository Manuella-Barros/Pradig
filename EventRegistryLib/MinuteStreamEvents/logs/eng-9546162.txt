Nayab Singh Saini blamed the Congress for the decision of the MLAs.\n\n\"I have received this information. Maybe Congress is engaged in fulfilling some people's wishes now. Congress has nothing to do with the wishes of the public,\" Saini said.\n\nThe three independent MLAs made the announcement at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.\n\nHooda said people do not trust the present government.\n\n\"Seeing that these people have taken back their support and have decided to support Congress,\" he said.\n\nLok Sabha polls in Haryana will be held on May 25 and the state will face assembly polls later this year. The decision of three MLAs to withdraw support came on the day voting took place on 93 seats in the third phase of Lok Sabha polls.\n\nUnion Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said he had seen reports and the party would respond after getting all the information.\n\n\"I got know about this, I saw that report but I don't have information on it...Our people will give you a statement when we get the information. None of our govts are in any danger...I am not even sure if the news is true or false,\" Puri said.\n\n'BJP has lost majority'\n\nCongress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said the BJP has lost the majority in the Haryana assembly.\n\n\"The situation in the state (Haryana) is against BJP, change is definite in the state. BJP govt has lost the majority. Among the list of 48 MLAs they had given, few MLAs have resigned because they are fighting the Lok Sabha election and some independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP and have extended their support to Congress. So the minority MLAs have no right,\" Deepender Hooda said.\n\nRandhir Golan, who is among the three MLAs who withdrew support, said there was high inflation and unemployment under the BJP government. \"For the last 4.5 years, we extended support to the BJP. Today unemployment and inflation are at their highest. Looking at this, we have withdrawn our support (from the government),\" he said.\n\nPraveen Attrey, Media Secretary to Haryana CM said three independent MLAs extending their support to Congress won't impact Haryana government.\n\n\"Today also Haryana government has majority and is safe. If you see the numbers, government has the support of 47 MLAs and because of this, the government is totally safe. If we talk from the legal point of view, no confidence motion can't be moved against Haryana government because earlier in the Vidhan Sabha Assembly, under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress had moved a no confidence motion which was dismissed so another no confidence motion can't be brought in for the next six months,\" he said.\n\n'No threat to govt'\n\nMeanwhile, BJP leader Jawahar Yadav assured that the Haryana government has no threat as it has the required majority.\n\n\"There is no danger to the Haryana government. Even after the three independent MLAs who have said that they have withdrawn support from the Haryana government, the Nayab Singh Saini government has the required majority. This can only be proven in the Vidhan Sabha. Bhupinder Singh Hooda of the Congress is only misleading people,\" Yadav said speaking to ANI on Tuesday.\n\nYadav said that conducting a trust vote in the Assembly in the next six months is difficult but they will be able to prove their majority if needed.\n\n\"On March 13, Nayab Singh Saini won the trust vote in the state assembly. Another trust vote within the next six months is difficult. If such a situation arises we will prove our majority,\" the BJP leader said.\n\nHitting out at the Leader of Opposition, Yadav said, \"I would like to challenge Bhupinder Singh Hooda to come to the Assembly and prove his majority. The BJP government has the required majority and our Chief Minister is Nayab Singh Saini.\"\n\nThree Independent MLAs withdrew their support to the BJP in Haryana amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state.\n\nThe three MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Charkhi Dadri), Randhir Golan (Pundri),and Dharampal Gondar (Nilokheri) - said they have decided to withdraw support from the Saini government and extend support to the Congress during the elections.\n\nIn the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP which had 41 MLAs initially was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.\n\nEarlier six out of seven Independent MLAs used to support the BJP. With three Independents withdrawing their support, the BJP at present, has the support of three Independents and one HLP MLA, making it a government of 43 MLAs.

The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House.\n\nIndependent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) announced their decision at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan.\n\n\"The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government,\" Hooda said.\n\nThe Congress said in a statement the three MLAs have already sent letters to the governor saying they have withdrawn their support to the government.\n\nAt the presser, Gonder said, \"We are withdrawing support to the government and have decided to extend support to the Congress. We have taken this decision due to various issues, including those of farmers, inflation and unemployment.\"\n\nUdai Bhan said, \"The three Independent MLAs have extended their support to the Congress...

But today unemployment is at its peak, and inflation and farmer issues are there. Every section of society is fed up. People are facing a lot of issues with Parivar Pehchan Patra (family ID card) and property ID system.\"\n\nWhen asked why they did not speak up on these issues earlier, Gollen said even during farmers agitation, they had raised their voice.\n\nSangwan said, \"During farmers' agitation, we opposed their (BJP govt) wrong policies. I also raised issues like inadequate staff in schools.\"\n\nReplying to a question, he said, \"We will support the Congress to help it win all 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state.\"\n\nThe Saini-led BJP government in Haryana had on March 13 won the trust vote by voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nRecently, several MLAs of JJP have come out in support of the ruling BJP.\n\nKhattar, who is contesting Lok Sabha polls from Karnal, had resigned as MLA from Karnal.\n\nFormer Haryana minister Ranjit Singh Chautala also resigned in March as MLA.

The former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that with the withdrawal of support by three independent candidates, the BJP-led government in the State has lost majority. Congress party is ready to parade all its MLAs before the Governor, he added.\n\nTalking to reporters after a workers' meeting in Bhiwani, Hooda said the Congress delegation of 30 MLAs would also reach Chandigarh soon.\n\nThe former Chief Minister said that 45 of the 88 sitting MLAs in the Haryana Assembly, including 30 MLAs of the Congress, 10 of the JJP, 3 Independent MLAs who have recently switched over to the Congress, Independent MLA from Meham Balraj Kundu and INLD MLA Abhey Chautala, were against the Saini-led government.\n\n\"Today an unconstitutional minority government is running in Haryana. In such a situation, the Governor should give time to parade all the MLAs in front of him. Congress is ready to parade all its MLAs before the Governor,\" he said.\n\nIn response to a question on JJP writing a letter to the Governor, Hooda said that JJP should also organize a parade of all its 10 MLAs before the Governor. \"If this happens, then there will be a total of 45 MLAs including 30 Congress, 3 independents supporting Congress, 10 JJP, Abhay Chautala and Balraj Kundu, who are not supporting the BJP government, as on date. In the House of 88 MLAs, the BJP government has the support of only 43 MLAs,\" he stated.\n\nHe said the state government itself should resign on moral grounds. Assembly elections should be conducted soon by imposing President's rule in the state. \"It's not necessary to tell you everything,\" said Hooda, when asked if more MLAs on the BJP side are in touch with him.\n\nThree independent MLAs including Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support from the BJP Government and extended it to the Congress party on Tuesday. Though the Saini Government maintains that there is no immediate threat to it and its leaders state that \"the government will complete its full term\", the Opposition has stepped up the ante against the ruling party.\n\nTalking to reporters, the former Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar claimed that many MLAs are in touch with the BJP and there is \"nothing to worry about\". Chief minister Nayab Singh Saini too asserted that there was no problem for the government.\n\nPolitical observers said that the BJP government appears safe for now. According to prevailing norms, a no-trust motion against a government can't be moved within six months of the previous one. In this case, the BJP government in Haryana had faced the no-confidence motion in February. The assembly elections are due in Haryana in October this year.\n\nDushyant seeks floor test in Haryana Assembly, writes to Governor\n\nJannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala on Thursday wrote to Governor Bandaru Dattatreya seeking a floor test for the present State government to prove its majority on the floor of the House. This comes days after three Independent MLAs withdrew support from the BJP government, extending support to the Congress.\n\nIn the letter, Dushyant has urged Haryana Governor Dattatreya to summon a session of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha and sought a floor test since the \"incumbent government does not command a majority\".\n\nWhile seeking directions to the competent authority, Chautala has said that if the government fails to call the session on the directions of the Governor, he may recommend President's rule in the state.\n\nQuoting the numbers as the parties and Independents stand in the House, Chautala quotes Article 174 while seeking the Governor's intervention. He goes on to add that the Nayab Singh Saini Government was formed with the support of six Independents. While three have withdrawn support, one Independent MLA resigned from the House and his resignation was accepted on April 30, necessitating a floor test since the government no longer has the numbers, the letter adds.", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pioneer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balraj_Kundu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balraj Kundu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meham_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meham Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhiwani_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhiwani district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhay_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhay Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 4095, "textEnd": 4103}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

We have taken this decision due to various issues, including those of farmers, inflation and unemployment. Speaking at the presser, Udai Bhan said, The three Independent MLAs have extended their support to the Congress...\n\nThree Independent MLAs on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government in Haryana and announced they would back the Congress, reducing the Nayab Singh Saini government to a minority in the state assembly. The government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House which has a current strength of 88. In recent days, some Jannayak Janata Party MLAs have indicated support to the BJP though the JJP pulled out of the coalition government in March. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. Independent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) announced their decision at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan. ''The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government,'' Hooda said.\n\nMeanwhile, JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said Hooda should initiate the process to ''bring down the government which has lost trust of people''. He also said Hooda should immediately meet the governor and apprise him of the situation. The Congress said in a statement the three MLAs have already sent letters to the governor saying they have withdrawn their support to the government.\n\nAt the presser, Gonder said, ''We are withdrawing support to the government and have decided to extend support to the Congress. We have taken this decision due to various issues, including those of farmers, inflation and unemployment.'' Speaking at the presser, Udai Bhan said, ''The three Independent MLAs have extended their support to the Congress... The BJP government earlier had support of 10 JJP MLAs and Independents, but the JJP also withdrew support and now Independents are also leaving.\n\n''Nayab Singh Saini government is now a minority government. Saini should tender his resignation as he does not have right to stay even for a minute,'' the Congress leader said.\n\nThe assembly elections in Haryana are due in October.\n\nHooda expressed his gratitude to the three MLAs for their support and said they have taken this decision keeping in mind the public sentiments.\n\nThe leader of the opposition said there is a wave in favour of the Congress in the country including Haryana and that the Independent MLAs have taken this decision respecting the sentiments of people.\n\nHe claimed people have made up their mind to form the Congress government in the state. Talking to PTI over phone, JJP's Digvijay Chautala said, ''Hooda says the government is in a minority. He is the Leader of Opposition and should immediately meet the governor and apprise him of the developments.'' When asked whether JJP will extend support to the Congress, Chautala said, ''I am not saying JJP is willing to support and form a government with the Congress. At least the government that has lost trust of people, Hooda should initiate the process to bring it down.'' He also said that in addition to meeting the governor, Hooda should also open a channel of communication with the JJP, which has 10 MLAs.\n\nAt the presser in Rohtak, Gollen said, ''We had given our support to the BJP government with honesty. But today unemployment is at its peak, and inflation and farmer issues are there. Every section of society is fed up. People are facing lot of issues with Parivar Pehchan Patra (family ID card) and property ID system.'' When asked why they did not speak up on these issues earlier, Gollen said even during farmers agitation, they had raised their voice.\n\nSangwan said, ''During farmers' agitation, we opposed their (BJP govt) wrong policies. I also raised issues like inadequate staff in schools.'' Replying to a question, he said, ''We will support the Congress to help it win all 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state.'' Meanwhile, Haryana AAP president Sushil Gupta, who is contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Kurukshetra with Congress' support, also said the BJP government is in a minority.\n\n''I request the governor that this government should be dismissed immediately,'' he said, adding that Chief Minister Saini has no right to continue and should step down.\n\nThe Saini-led BJP government in Haryana had on March 13 won the trust vote by voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Manohar Lal Khattar. Recently, several MLAs of JJP have come out in support of the ruling BJP.\n\nKhattar, who is contesting Lok Sabha polls from Karnal, had resigned as MLA from Karnal. Former Haryana minister Ranjit Singh Chautala also resigned in March as MLA. He was an Independent MLA from Rania segment and resigned on March 24 as he joined the BJP, which has announced his candidature for Hisar Lok Sabha seat.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

A minority government has no moral right. This government should resign immediately on moral grounds.\"\n\nThe Congress candidate added further, \"We demand that if the government does not resign, then the Governor should take cognizance of the matter and impose President's rule in Haryana and conduct elections.\"\n\nHooda also took a jibe at the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and said, \"The JJP should give in writing that they are not in support of BJP... They are famous as a betrayal party in the whole country...\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala on Thursday offered to \"consider\" outside support to the Congress to bring down the Haryana government and said that the Governor has the power to order a floor test, adding that if the government doesn't have the majority, then they should immediately implement President's Rule in the state.\n\n\"The government that was formed two months back is now in the minority because two of the MLAs who supported them--one from the BJP and the other an Independent MLA--have resigned. Three Independent MLAs who were supporting them have withdrawn their support and have written to the Governor. JJP has clearly said that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this government, we will support the motion. We have also written to the Governor about it. Now, Congress has to take this step (seeking a floor test). Congress will have to decide if they are going to take any steps to corner the current BJP government or not,\" Chautala told ANI.\n\nHe further said that the Governor should implement the President's Rule in Haryana if the state government doesn't have the \"majority.\"\n\nEarlier on May 7, the Haryana government suffered a jolt when three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government, pushing the government into a minority. The three MLAs are Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri. All of them decided to extend support to Congress.\n\nHowever, the BJP appears confident of retaining power, with former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP.\n\nThe development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nIn the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP, which had 41 MLAs initially, was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.

The Saini-led BJP government in Haryana had on March 13 won the trust vote by voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nThree Independent MLAs on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government in Haryana and announced they would back the Congress, reducing the Nayab Singh Saini government to a minority in the state assembly. The government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House which has a current strength of 88. In recent days, some Jannayak Janata Party MLAs have indicated support to the BJP though the JJP pulled out of the coalition government in March. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. Independent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) announced their decision at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan. ''The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government,'' Hooda said.\n\nThe Congress said in a statement the three MLAs have already sent letters to the governor saying they have withdrawn their support to the government.\n\nAt the presser, Gonder said, ''We are withdrawing support to the government and have decided to extend support to the Congress. We have taken this decision due to various issues, including those of farmers, inflation and unemployment.'' Speaking at the presser, Udai Bhan said, ''The three Independent MLAs have extended their support to the Congress... The BJP government earlier had support of 10 JJP MLAs and Independents, but the JJP also withdrew support and now Independents are also leaving.\n\n''Nayab Singh Saini government is now a minority government. Saini should tender his resignation as he does not have right to stay even for a minute,'' the Congress leader said.\n\nThe assembly elections in Haryana are due in October.\n\nHooda expressed his gratitude to the three MLAs for their support and said they have taken this decision keeping in mind the public sentiments.\n\nThe leader of the opposition said there is a wave in favour of the Congress in the country including Haryana and that the Independent MLAs have taken this decision respecting the sentiments of people.\n\nHe claimed people have made up their mind to form the Congress government in the state. At the presser, Gollen said, ''We had given our support to the BJP government with honesty. But today unemployment is at its peak, and inflation and farmer issues are there. Every section of society is fed up. People are facing lot of issues with Parivar Pehchan Patra (family ID card) and property ID system.'' When asked why they did not speak up on these issues earlier, Gollen said even during farmers agitation, they had raised their voice.\n\nSangwan said, ''During farmers' agitation, we opposed their (BJP govt) wrong policies. I also raised issues like inadequate staff in schools.'' Replying to a question, he said, ''We will support the Congress to help it win all 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state.'' The Saini-led BJP government in Haryana had on March 13 won the trust vote by voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Manohar Lal Khattar. Recently, several MLAs of JJP have come out in support of the ruling BJP.\n\nKhattar, who is contesting Lok Sabha polls from Karnal, had resigned as MLA from Karnal. Former Haryana minister Ranjit Singh Chautala also resigned in March as MLA. He was an Independent MLA from Rania segment and resigned on March 24 as he joined the BJP, which has announced his candidature for Hisar Lok Sabha seat.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

What happens next?", "body": "New Delhi: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Haryana government suffered a jolt after three Independent MLAs took back their support from it. The three MLAs have announced that they would back the Congress amid the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. The Congress party, which is led by former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, demanded immediate dissolution of the the BJP government, calling it \"illegitimate\".\n\nWith three Independent MLAs withdrawing support to the Nayab Singh Saini-led government, the BJP has now backing of at least three other Independent MLAs. Earlier, it had support of six Independent MLAs.\n\nThe three independent MLAs who jumped the ship are Sombir Sangwan (Charkhi Dadri), Randhir Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri). They have claimed that the Saini-led BJP government in Haryana has lost majority after their withdrawal, while calling for the state elections without any delay. \"We have taken this decision on various issues including those related to farmers,\" Gonder reportedly said.\n\nAmid the development, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday rubbished the reports of crisis. He pointed out, \"When I heard about it, I knew that very moment that the Congress was trying to fulfil their wishes. Everyone has a wish,\" Saini. He added, \"But the people know. They know the Congress has got nothing to do with the wishes of people, but only with fulfilling their wishes.\"\n\nIt is to be noted that Nayab Singh Saini replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as Haryana CM two months back. The looming question is will the BJP government weather the apparent storm? Will the Congress make full use of the 'crisis' and wrest control from the BJP? Let's find out how numbers stand for both the parties.\n\nThe Haryana Assembly comprises 90 MLAs. The present party position in the state assembly is as follows:\n\nThe BJP has 40 MLAs (after Manohar Lal Khattar resigned as MLA and CM in March 2024).\n\nThe Congress has 30 MLAs and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) 10. As three MLAs have extended it support, the party's tally reaches 33. This is 13 MLAs short of the majority mark.\n\nIndian National Lok Dal (INLD) has 1 MLA in the state Assembly.\n\nSome time back, some JJP MLAs have dropped hints at supporting to the BJP though the JJP pulled out of the coalition government in March.\n\nHaryana is staring at a hung assembly scenario, since no single party has enough numbers to form a government.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, the governor usually extends an invitation to the leader of the single-largest party, currently the BJP, to form a temporary government for 10 days. During this duration, the party is given the chance to prove its support from other parties.\n\nIn case the party is unable to prove a majority within 10 days, the governor will dissolve the government and a fresh election will be held.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tirtho_banerjee@news9live.com", "name": "Tirtho Banerjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charkhi_Dadri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charkhi Dadri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charkhi Dadri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nayab-Saini.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

In the present House, the BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member. Independents are six.\n\nIf the opposition seeks a no-confidence motion in the state assembly, the BJP may need JJP MLAs to abstain.\n\nReferring to the three Independent MLAs withdrawing their support, Chautala said hectic political developments have taken place in the last day.\n\n\"We demand that on moral grounds, the CM should either prove majority or submit his resignation,\" he said.\n\n\"We will request and even write to the Governor that he should give direction to the government to prove majority,\" he said.\n\nReferring to the JJP's earlier alliance with the BJP, Chautala said, \"Till the time we were supporting the government, never such a situation arose\".\n\nThe way three Independent MLAs have withdrawn support shows that the BJP has turned weak. The claims made by the BJP of winning 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana as well as the Karnal assembly seat in the bypoll have also fallen weak,\" he said.\n\nOn some JJP MLAs indicating support to the BJP, Chautala said notices have been issued to three of them and they have been asked to submit a reply.\n\n\"Three MLAs have been issued notice, but they have not replied yet.Appropriate action will be taken by the party,\" he said.\n\nHe said his party MLAs are bound by the whip and if anyone wants to extend support to anyone else they will have to resign first.\n\n\"If anyone takes part in anti-party activity, there is a law for that,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress sought the imposition of President's Rule followed by fresh polls in Haryana.\n\nThe party said it would write to Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya to demand that the BJP government be dismissed. It also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nTalking to reporters in Sirsa on Wednesday, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini asserted that his government was not in trouble and was working strongly.\n\n\"We are going to write to the Governor that three Independent MLAs have withdrawn support and they have extended support to our party... the government is in the minority and they have no right to stay in power. We will demand that the government be dismissed, President's Rule be imposed and fresh elections be held,\" Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said.\n\nSenior Congress leader B B Batra said the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), once an ally of the BJP in the state, should write to the Governor making it clear that they were not supporting the dispensation.\n\nReacting to Chautala's statement, Batra said, \"Let the JJP write a letter to the Governor stating that they are not supporting the BJP government... We may know this fact (that JJP is not supporting them) but let them give a letter stating the same.\n\n\"Like the three Independent MLAs wrote a letter to Governor stating they have withdrawn their support... The JJP should also do this,\" he said.\n\nSaini had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister in March and the JJP's four-and-a-half-year-old post-poll alliance with BJP had come to an end with Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala saying they will not be part of the new government headed by Saini.\n\nBJP's Jawahar Yadav said there was no danger to the BJP government in the state.\n\nHe said the Saini government won a trust vote on March 13 and if it has to prove its majority on the floor of the House, it will do so.\n\nThe government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House which has a current strength of 88.\n\nAmong the three Independent MLAs who withdrew their support, Gollen fought as an Independent and defeated Congress party's Satbir Bhana in the 2019 Haryana assembly polls.\n\nHe had unsuccessfully fought the 2014 assembly polls on a BJP ticket. He had remained chairman of the Haryana Tourism Corporation.\n\nGonder defeated BJP nominee Bhagwan Das Kabirpanthi from the Nilokheri seat in the 2019 assembly polls. He had remained the chairman of the Haryana Forest Development Corporation.\n\nSangwan won the Dadri assembly seat by defeating JJP nominee Satpal Sangwan in the previous assembly elections. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly polls.\n\nAs the intervening period between holding two assembly sessions should not be more than six months, the governor will have to summon the House before September 13.\n\nState assembly polls in Haryana are due in October while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25 along with voting to the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana.\n\nSaini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41.\n\nThe Saini-led BJP government in Haryana on March 13 won the trust vote by a voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Khattar.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news",

Image Courtesy: X/@INCHaryana\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Haryana witnessed a setback on Tuesday (7 May) after three Independent MLAs withdrew their support and shifted their allegiance to its rival Congress. The Grand Old Party said that the Nayab Singh Saini government is now in the minority and demanded the chief minister's resignation.\n\nThe development comes just two weeks before the Lok Sabha elections in Haryana. The Assembly elections in the state are also slated for later this year.\n\nWill the BJP government in Haryana survive? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThree Independent MLAs - Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) - said they have decided to switch their support from the BJP to the Congress.\n\nThey made the announcement at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress president Udai Bhan. The MLAs said they had informed the governor about their decision, reported ThePrint.\n\nExplaining why he shifted his support from the BJP to Congress, Golan, as per Indian Express, said, \"We kept supporting the BJP government honestly over the past four-and-a-half years. But today, inflation and unemployment have touched new heights, while farmers, labourers, traders, employees... everyone... is upset because of the concept of family ID and property ID.\"\n\nSaini's predecessor, the former BJP CM Manohar Lal Khattar, had introduced one ID card for families to avail government benefits.\n\nGolan said their move should not be seen as \"opportunism\", adding that it was \"a reflection of the public's voice\", reported the Indian Express newspaper.\n\nGondher, the other Independent MLA to shift sides, told the media that he, Golan, Sangwan and another Independent MLA, Nayan Pal Rawat, had decided to extend support to the BJP while Khattar was the CM. \"When our Senapati (Khattar) went away, it hurt us,\" he was quoted as saying by the newspaper.\n\nCongress, JJP react\n\nThe Congress is calling for CM Saini's resignation and the imposition of President's rule in Haryana.\n\nBhupinder Singh Hooda, the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the state Assembly, also demanded early elections.\n\n\"After the withdrawal of support by the three MLAs, the Nayab Singh Saini government has lost the moral authority to remain in power. The governor should immediately dismiss the government and impose President's rule besides ordering early elections to the state Assembly to respect the people's mandate,\" he told ThePrint.\n\nAddressing the presser, Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said the BJP government has lost the majority in the state Assembly. He said the Assembly elections in Haryana should be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls in the state on 25 May, reported Indian Express.\n\n\"Nayab Singh Saini government is now a minority government. Saini should tender his resignation as he does not have the right to stay even for a minute,\" he was quoted as saying by PTI.\n\nThe Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), whose alliance with the BJP collapsed in March over seat-sharing, has also commented on the development.\n\nOn Wednesday (8 May), JJP leader Dushyant Chautala reportedly said he would \"support Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda\" if the former Congress CM initiates a move to topple the BJP government.\n\n\"The BJP is talking of winning all 10 Lok Sabha seats and one seat of Karnal bypoll. But three MLAs withdrawing support shows how weak the BJP has become. I would also like to tell the Leader of Opposition that according to the mathematics of numbers today, if a step is taken to topple this government during elections, I would thoroughly consider supporting him [Hooda] from outside. It is now for Congress to think if it will take a step to topple the BJP government,\" Chautala said, as per Indian Express.\n\nJJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said Hooda should begin the process to \"bring down the government which has lost the trust of people\". He also said the Leader of the Opposition should meet Governor Bandaru Dattatraya and apprise him of the situation, as per the PTI report.\n\nBJP in defensive mode\n\nHaryana CM Saini has said that his government is not in trouble and is \"working strongly\", reported PTI.\n\nHe also blamed the Congress for the development. \"Some MLAs have their desires&mldr; Congress is fulfilling (the) desires (of such people), but people know everything. Congress is not concerned about the desires of people, but only about itself,\" Saini told the news agency.\n\nHow the numbers stack up\n\nIn the 2019 Haryana Assembly polls, the BJP won 40 out of the total 90 seats in the House, Congress 31, JJP 10, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) one seat each, and Independents seven.\n\nAfter Congress' Kuldeep Bishnoi resigned as an MLA to join the BJP and his son Bhavya won from Adampur on a saffron party ticket, the BJP's tally rose to 41. The Congress' count came down to 30.\n\nUntil 12 March, the Khattar government had the support of 41 BJP MLAs, 10 JJP MLAs, six Independents and one HLP MLA, noted ThePrint.\n\nAfter Khattar stepped down as Haryana CM and Saini replaced him in March, the government was backed by 47 MLAs - 40 from the BJP, six Independents, and HLP's Gopal Kanda. It was at this time that the BJP-JJP alliance fell apart.\n\nKhattar also resigned as a member of the state assembly and was given a ticket by the BJP to contest from the Karnal Lok Sabha seat.\n\nLater, Independent MLA Ranjit Singh also resigned and was fielded by the BJP from the Hisar Lok Sabha constituency. Following the developments, the Haryana government was left with the support of 46 members in the House which now had the strength of 88.\n\nAfter three Independent MLAs crossed sides on Tuesday, the Saini government has the support of 43 MLAs -- BJP 40, two Independents, and one HLP. Now, it is two short of the majority mark of 45 in the current 88-member House.\n\nHowever, the BJP claims it has the majority mark.\n\nParveen Attrey, media secretary to the Haryana government, has said the Saini government still enjoys the support of 47 MLAs, including four MLAs from the BJP's erstwhile ally JJP.\n\n\"We have 40 MLAs of our own, and we have the support of the Haryana Lokhit Party's Gopal Kanda, two Independents Rakesh Daulatabad (Badshahpur) and Nayan Pal Rawat (Prithla) and four JJP MLAs, Devender Babli (Tohana), Jogi Ram Sihag (Barwala), Ram Kumar Gautam (Narnaund) and Ram Niwas Surjakhera (Narwana),\" Attrey told ThePrint.\n\nWhether the BJP government in Haryana survives this crisis is a question only time will tell. Till then, we will have to wait and watch.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Image: X)\n\nIn a setback to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana amid the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, three Independent MLAs on Tuesday announced that they have withdrawn their support to the Nayab Singh Saini-led government in the state.\n\nThis leaves the BJP, with 40 MLAs, tentatively placed in the Assembly. With the House strength reduced to 88, the majority mark is 45. Technically, the BJP government has the support of 43 MLAs now, though it claimed on Tuesday that four Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs too may offer \"tactical assistance to the government if needed\", taking its strength to 47.\n\nThe three MLAs - Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Gollen and Dharampal Gonder - also said that they have decided to extend support to the Congress during the elections, PTI reported.\n\nThey made the announcement at a press conference held in Rohtak in presence of former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan.\n\nAlso Read: Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Election Commission asks X to take down Karnataka BJP post targeting Muslims\n\n\"We are withdrawing support to the government. We are extending our support to the Congress,\" Gonder said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision on various issues including those related to farmers,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the presser, Udai Bhan said, \"The three Independent MLAs - Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Singh Gollen and Dharampal Gonder - have withdrawn their support to the BJP government and extended their support to the Congress.\"\n\n\"I also want to say that present strength of (90-member) Haryana Assembly is 88, of which the BJP has 40 members. The BJP government earlier had support of JJP MLAs and Independents, but JJP had also withdrawn support and now Independents are also leaving,\" he added.\n\n\"Nayab Singh Saini government is now a minority government. He should tender his resignation as he does not have right to stay even for a minute,\" said Bhan.\n\nAlso Read: Prajwal Revanna case: 25,000 pen drives distributed, says Kumaraswamy, claims conspiracy by Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar\n\nNow, the assembly polls should be held immediately, he added.\n\nCM Nayab Singh Saini accused the Congress of engineering what had happened. \"Some MLAs have some ambitions. These days, the Congress is apparently fulfilling desires (of such people). People understand this. They also know who has what ambitions. The Congress has nothing to do with the needs of the people. They care only about their ambitions,\" he said.\n\nWhile the total strength of the House is 90, right now it is 88 as two MLAs resigned earlier to contest the Lok Sabha polls, both on BJP tickets. While former BJP CM Manohar Lal Khattar is the candidate from the Karnal Lok Sabha seat, Ranjit Singh Chautala, earlier an Independent MLA, is contesting on the BJP ticket from Hisar.\n\nTwo months ago, the BJP snapped ties with the JJP of Dushyant Chautala, whose 10 MLAs had helped it form the government in 2019. Of the JJP's 10 MLAs, at least six have distanced themselves from Chautala.\n\nThe Congress has 30 MLAs in the House. The support of the three Independents takes its tally to 33.\n\nRejecting the Congress's claims of the BJP government losing its majority, Saini's media secretary Praveen Attrey told The Indian Express that apart from the BJP's own 40 MLAs, the party had the support of two Independent MLAs, Nayan Pal Rawat and Rakesh Daultabad; Gopal Kanda of the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP); and four JJP MLAs, Devender Singh Babli, Ram Kumar Gautam, Jogi Ram Sihag and Ram Niwas Surjakhera.\n\n\"The BJP government thus has the support of 47 MLAs against the simple majority mark of 45,\" Attrey added.",

But three MLAs withdrawing support shows how weak the BJP has become. I would also like to tell Leader of Opposition that according to the mathematics of numbers today, if a step is taken to topple this government during elections, I would thoroughly consider supporting him [Hooda] from outside. It is now for Congress to think if it will take a step to topple the BJP government,\" Chautala said, days before Haryana is set to vote in the Lok Sabha elections on May 25.\n\nJannayak Janta Party (JJP), an offshoot of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), has 10 members in the 90-seat Haryana assembly. In October 2019, the party joined hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form a coalition government but parted ways in March this year. Chautala was deputy chief minister to BJP's Manohar Lal Khattar in the alliance government.\n\nAlso Read: Haryana BJP government in crisis as 3 Independent MLAs cross sides, support Congress\n\n\"Three MLAs have withdrawn support and two MLAs, including Manohar Lal Khattar (Lok Sabha candidate from Karnal) and Ranjit Singh (candidate from Hisar), have resigned from the Vidhan Sabha. This makes it five MLAs out of the Vidhan Sabha. It proves that the BJP government has failed to have a simple majority. I demand that the chief minister resign on moral grounds. The three Independents have sent their withdrawal of support to the governor. We shall also urge the governor and even send it in writing to him seeking directions to the state government to prove majority,\" Chautala added.\n\nHow do the numbers stack up?\n\nThe current strength of the Haryana assembly is 88 as two MLAs resigned earlier to contest the Lok Sabha polls, both on BJP tickets. While former BJP CM Manohar Lal Khattar is the candidate from the Karnal Lok Sabha seat, Ranjit Singh Chautala, earlier an Independent MLA, is contesting on the BJP ticket from Hisar.\n\nWith MLAs Dharampal Gondher (Nilokheri), Randhir Golan (Pundri) and Sombir Sangwan (Dadri) withdrawing support, the BJP, with 40 MLAs, is tentatively placed in the 88-member Assembly - the majority mark is 45.\n\nIn the 2019 Assembly polls, the JJP had won 10 seats and the BJP, 40 seats. Both parties entered into a post-poll alliance and formed a coalition government in Haryana. Two months ago, the BJP broke off ties with the JJP.\n\nCurrently, the BJP has 40 MLAs. The BJP government also has the support of two other Independents, which takes its total strength to 42. The BJP is 3 short of the majority mark.\n\nAlso Read: Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Election Commission asks X to take down Karnataka BJP post targeting Muslims\n\nAlthough, it claimed on Tuesday that four Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs too may offer \"tactical assistance to the government if needed\", taking its strength to 47.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress won 30 seats in the 2019 Assembly polls and with the support of the three Independent MLAs, the strength now stands at 33.\n\nIf it manages to get support from JJP, the number will go up to 43. In that event, it will need the support of two other MLAs - who are Gopal Kanda from the Haryana Lokhit Party and an MLA from INLD.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe Congress on Wednesday demanded the President's Rule and fresh elections in Haryana as three Independent MLAs withdrew support from the BJP government and extended it to their party. The Nayab Singh Saini-led BJP government currently has 40 MLAs in the Assembly, shy of the majority mark of 45 in the now 88-member House.\n\n\"We are going to write to the Governor that three

The party said it would write to Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya to demand that the BJP government be dismissed. It also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nTalking to reporters in Sirsa on Wednesday, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini asserted that his government was not in trouble and was working strongly. \"We are going to write to the Governor that three Independent MLAs have withdrawn support and they have extended support to our party... the government is in the minority and they have no right to stay in power.

Bhan said the three Independent MLAs have already written to the Governor regarding their withdrawal of support. Senior Congress leader B B Batra said the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), once an ally of the BJP in the state, should write to the Governor making it clear that they were not supporting the dispensation.\n\nOn Tuesday, JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda should initiate the process to \"bring down\" the Nayab Singh Saini government \"which has lost the trust of people\". Reacting to Chautala's statement, Batra said, \"Let the JJP write a letter to the Governor stating that they are not supporting the BJP government... We may know this fact (that JJP is not supporting them) but let them give a letter stating the same. \"Like the three Independent MLAs wrote a letter to Governor stating they have withdrawn their support... The JJP should also do this,\" he said.\n\nThe three Independent MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) -- on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government in Haryana and announced they would back the Congress. Saini had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister in March and the JJP's four-and-a-half-year-old post-poll alliance with BJP had come to an end with Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala saying they will not be part of the new government headed by Saini. BJP's Jawahar Yadav said there was no danger to the BJP government in the state.

The government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House which has a current strength of 88. Among the three Independent MLAs who withdrew their support, Gollen fought as an Independent and defeated Congress party's Satbir Bhana in the 2019 Haryana assembly polls. He had unsuccessfully fought the 2014 assembly polls on a BJP ticket. He had remained chairman of the Haryana Tourism Corporation.\n\nGonder defeated BJP nominee Bhagwan Das Kabirpanthi from the Nilokheri seat in the 2019 assembly polls. He had remained the chairman of the Haryana Forest Development Corporation. Sangwan won the Dadri assembly seat by defeating JJP nominee Satpal Sangwan in the previous assembly elections. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly polls. In recent days, some JJP MLAs have hinted at supporting the BJP. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. If the opposition seeks a no-confidence motion in the state assembly, the BJP may need JJP MLAs to abstain.\n\nAs the intervening period between holding two assembly sessions should not be more than six months, the governor will have to summon the House before September 13. State Assembly polls in Haryana are due in October while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25 along with voting to the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana. Saini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41. The Saini-led BJP government in Haryana on March 13 won the trust vote by a voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Khattar.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com",

How Numbers Stack Up", "body": "Haryana's sitting CM Nayab Singh Saini with former CM Manohar Lal Khattar | Image:ANI\n\nNew Delhi: Political crisis seems to deepening in Haryana after 3 independent MLAs withdrew support from Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini-led BJP government. While on one side CM Saini claimed that BJP dispensation had no troubles and is working strongly, party's former ally Dushyant Chautala has offered support to the Congress to topple the state government.\n\nIndependent MLAs Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Singh Gollen and Dharampal Gonder withdrew support to the BJP government in Haryana on Tuesday, and announced that they would back the Congress. This has reduced the BJP government to a minority in the state Assembly.\n\nSaini was sworn-in as the new chief minster of Haryana on March 12, 2024 hours after Manohar Lal Khattar and his Cabinet ministers resigned from their posts. While Khattar government had the support of Jannayak Janata Party, the new government was formed with the support of independent MLAs. Infact, Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala also took oath along with CM Saini as his council's minister.\n\nBJP leaders congratulating Nayab Singh Saini after he was elected as legislative party leader and was sworn-in as the new CM of Haryana in March this year. (Image: Republic)\n\nNo Troubles For BJP: CM Saini Downplays Crisis\n\nHaryana CM Nayab Singh Saini, blaming the Congress for political crisi in the state, said that the government has no troubles and is working strongly. \"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Saini told reporters at Sirsa when asked to comment on the withdrawal of support. He was in Sirsa to campaign for Ashok Tanwar, the Lok Sabha poll candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\n\n\"The Congress knows that it cannot fulfil the aspirations of people and misleads them. It tries to create a state of confusion that the (state) government is in minority,\" he asserted.\n\n\" The whole country has seen the history of the Congress, when they were short of majority in Lok Sabha or in a state they would fulfill some people's wishes. Some people may have problems, but the state government has no problems and the people of the state will not let the Congress party fulfil its wishes. They rely on corruption while we rely on development,\" said the Chief Minister, as quoted by ANI.\n\nDushyant Chautala's Open Offer to Congress\n\nFormer Deputy CM in Manohar Lal Khattar's government, Dushyant Chautala, asserted that he would support the Congress party if it is willing to bring down the BJP government in the state. He said that if Leader of Opposition B S Hooda takes steps to bring down the Nayab Saini government, his party would support the move. If a no-confidence motion is brought against the Saini government, Chautala said they will vote against the government.\n\n\"I want to tell Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda that going by the present numbers in the Assembly, if a step is taken that this government is brought down during (Lok Sabha) elections, then we will fully consider to support them in this from outside,\" said Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday during a press conference.\n\nChautala Hell Bent to Bring Down BJP Government\n\nHe said that the party will issue a whip to its MLAs to vote against the BJP-led Haryana government. \"I want to say on record that if a floor test is held, our MLAs will vote to bring down the government. JJP will issue a whip and vote against it,\" he said. He said his party MLAs are bound by the whip and if anyone wants to extend support to anyone else they will have to resign first. Now, Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the BJP government,\" he added.\n\nHe also asked for Chief Minister's resignation, asserting that the government has lost majority and Saini must resign on moral grounds.\"We demand that on moral grounds, the CM should either prove majority or submit his resignation,\" he said.\n\nRuling out any possibility of supporting the BJP after its alliance ended, Chautala said, \"I have made it quite clear that the JJP will not go with the BJP now\".\n\nCongress in Picture?\n\nOn the other side, the Haryana unit of Congress said that it will write to the governor stating that the Saini government is in minority after the three Independent MLAs withdrew support to it and that it should be dismissed, reported PTI.\n\nThe Congress said that it would ask the Governor to impose President's rule in the state and announce fresh assembly polls. As far as forming of new government in Haryana is concerned, the Congress party has not yet decided upon its next move. polls are due----\n\nHow Numbers Stack Up in Haryana Assembly\n\nHaryana state assembly has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. In the present House, the BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member. Independents are six. The current BJP government, which has the support of two other Independent legislators, is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House.\n\nIn the 2019 assembly elections, JJP had won 10 seats while the BJP had bagged 40 seats. They had formed a coalition government in Haryana. However, the BJP snapped ties with the JJP two months ago and Saini took over the state government. The main opposition Congress has 30 MLAs and the Indian National Lok Dal and the Haryana Lokhit Party have one seat each. The BJP has the support of 2 independent MLAs.\n\nBJP Confident of Majority\n\nThe way sitting CM Nayab Singh Saini dismissed the questions of BJP government being is trouble indicates that it is confident of majority if asked to prove on floor of the House.\n\nSimilar confidence was exuded by former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar. While speaking to reporters, Khattar claimed that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP.\n\n\"This political battle will go long, many people are in touch with us, be it from Congress or JJP. They should take care of their home first... We will make sure that in the next election (of state assembly), we get a full majority so that such situations don't arise,\" the former Haryana CM said.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com",

It also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the Governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nAlso read | After three independent MLAs withdraw support, former CM Manohar Lal Khattar says 'Lotus will bloom in Haryana'\n\nTalking to reporters in Sirsa on Wednesday, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini asserted that his government was not in trouble and was working strongly.\n\n\"We are going to write to the Governor that three Independent MLAs have withdrawn support and they have extended support to our party... the government is in the minority and they have no right to stay in power. We will demand that the government be dismissed, President's Rule be imposed and fresh elections be held,\" Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said.\n\n\"Likewise, the JJP should also write a letter that the government be dismissed. INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu, who claim to be opposing the government, should also write similar letters to the Governor,\" he added.\n\nMr. Bhan said the three Independent MLAs have already written to the Governor regarding their withdrawal of support.\n\nSenior Congress leader B.B. Batra said the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), once an ally of the BJP in the State, should write to the Governor making it clear that they were not supporting the dispensation.\n\nIf Congress takes steps to step to bring down Saini govt, we will support: Dushyant Chautala\n\nOn Tuesday, JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said said that if Leader of Opposition B.S. Hooda takes steps to bring down the Nayab Saini government, his party would support the move.\n\n\"I want to tell Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda that going by the present numbers in the Assembly, if a step is taken that this government is brought down during [Lok Sabha] elections, then we will fully consider to support them in this,\" Mr. Chautala told reporters in Hisar.\n\n\"Now, the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the BJP government,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether his party will support the Congress, he replied, \"We are clear that steps should be taken to bring down the government\".\n\nReacting to Mr. Chautala's statement, Mr. Batra said, \"Let the JJP write a letter to the Governor stating that they are not supporting the BJP government... We may know this fact [that JJP is not supporting them] but let them give a letter stating the same.\n\n\"Like the three Independent MLAs wrote a letter to Governor stating they have withdrawn their support... The JJP should also do this,\" he said.\n\nThe three Independent MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) -- on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government in Haryana and announced they would back the Congress.\n\nMr. Saini had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister in March and the JJP's four-and-a-half-year-old post-poll alliance with BJP had come to an end with Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala saying they will not be part of the new government headed by Mr. Saini.\n\nBJP's Jawahar Yadav said there was no danger to the BJP government in the state.\n\nHe said the Saini government won a trust vote on March 13 and if it has to prove its majority on the floor of the House, it will do so.\n\nThe government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House which has a current strength of 88.\n\nAmong the three Independent MLAs who withdrew their support, Gollen fought as an Independent and defeated Congress party's Satbir Bhana in the 2019 Haryana assembly polls.\n\nHe had unsuccessfully fought the 2014 Assembly polls on a BJP ticket. He had remained chairman of the Haryana Tourism Corporation.\n\nGonder defeated BJP nominee Bhagwan Das Kabirpanthi from the Nilokheri seat in the 2019 assembly polls. He had remained the chairman of the Haryana Forest Development Corporation.\n\nSangwan won the Dadri Assembly seat by defeating JJP nominee Satpal Sangwan in the previous assembly elections. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Assembly polls.\n\nIn recent days, some JJP MLAs have hinted at supporting the BJP. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. If the opposition seeks a no-confidence motion in the state assembly, the BJP may need JJP MLAs to abstain.\n\nAs the intervening period between holding two Assembly sessions should not be more than six months, the Governor will have to summon the House before September 13.\n\nState Assembly polls in Haryana are due in October while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25 along with voting to the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana.\n\nMr. Saini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41.\n\nThe Saini-led BJP government in Haryana on March 13 won the trust vote by a voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Khattar.\n\nRead

Hooda demanded either the government's resignation or President's Rule imposition. Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) also offered support to bring down the government. The ruling BJP remains confident despite losing support. Amidst the ongoing Haryana political crisis, Congress candidate from Rohtak Lok Sabha constituency Deepender Singh Hooda on Thursday said that after the three independent MLAs withdrew their support, the government in the state has come into a minority and should resign immediately.\n\nSpeaking with the reporters, Deepender Singh Hooda said, \"The way three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support and supported Congress in Haryana, the government here has come into the minority. A minority government has no moral right. This government should resign immediately on moral grounds.\"\n\nThe Congress candidate added further, \"We demand that if the government does not resign, then the Governor should take cognizance of the matter and impose President's rule in Haryana and conduct elections.\"\n\nHooda also took a jibe at the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and said, \"The JJP should give in writing that they are not in support of BJP... They are famous as a betrayal party in the whole country...\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala on Thursday offered to \"consider\" outside support to the Congress to bring down the Haryana government and said that the Governor has the power to order a floor test, adding that if the government doesn't have the majority, then they should immediately implement President's Rule in the state.\n\n\"The government that was formed two months back is now in the minority because two of the MLAs who supported them--one from the BJP and the other an Independent MLA--have resigned. Three Independent MLAs who were supporting them have withdrawn their support and have written to the Governor. JJP has clearly said that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this government, we will support the motion. We have also written to the Governor about it. Now, Congress has to take this step (seeking a floor test). Congress will have to decide if they are going to take any steps to corner the current BJP government or not,\" Chautala told ANI.\n\nHe further said that the Governor should implement the President's Rule in Haryana if the state government doesn't have the \"majority.\"\n\nEarlier on May 7, the Haryana government suffered a jolt when three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government, pushing the government into a minority. The three MLAs are Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri. All of them decided to extend support to Congress.\n\nHowever, the BJP appears confident of retaining power, with former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP.\n\nThe development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nIn the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP, which had 41 MLAs initially, was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.

It also asked the JJP, the INLD, and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nTalking to reporters in Sirsa on Wednesday, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini asserted that his government was not in trouble and was working strongly.\n\n\"We are going to write to the Governor that three independent MLAs have withdrawn support and they have extended support to our party... The government is in the minority and they have no right to stay in power.

He had remained chairman of the Haryana Tourism Corporation.\n\nGonder defeated BJP nominee Bhagwan Das Kabirpanthi from the Nilokheri seat in the 2019 assembly polls. He had remained the chairman of the Haryana Forest Development Corporation.\n\nSangwan won the Dadri assembly seat by defeating JJP nominee Satpal Sangwan in the previous assembly elections. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly polls.\n\nIn recent days, some JJP MLAs have hinted at supporting the BJP. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. If the opposition seeks a no-confidence motion in the state assembly, the BJP may need JJP MLAs to abstain.\n\nAs the intervening period between holding two assembly sessions should not be more than six months, the governor will have to summon the House before September 13.\n\nState Assembly polls in Haryana are due in October, while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25, along with voting for the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana.\n\nSaini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41.\n\nThe Saini-led BJP government in Haryana on March 13 won the trust vote by a voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister, replacing Khattar.", "source":

Speaking with the reporters, Deepender Singh Hooda said, \"The way three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support and supported Congress in Haryana, the government here has come into the minority. A minority government has no moral right. This government should resign immediately on moral grounds.\"\n\nThe Congress candidate added further, \"We demand that if the government does not resign, then the Governor should take cognizance of the matter and impose President's rule in Haryana and conduct elections.\" Hooda also took a jibe at the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and said, \"The JJP should give in writing that they are not in support of BJP... They are famous as a betrayal party in the whole country...\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala on Thursday offered to \"consider\" outside support to the Congress to bring down the Haryana government and said that the Governor has the power to order a floor test, adding that if the government doesn't have the majority, then they should immediately implement President's Rule in the state. \"The government that was formed two months back is now in the minority because two of the MLAs who supported them--one from the BJP and the other an Independent MLA--have resigned. Three Independent MLAs who were supporting them have withdrawn their support and have written to the Governor. JJP has clearly said that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this government, we will support the motion. We have also written to the Governor about it. Now, Congress has to take this step (seeking a floor test). Congress will have to decide if they are going to take any steps to corner the current BJP government or not,\" Chautala told ANI.\n\nHe further said that the Governor should implement the President's Rule in Haryana if the state government doesn't have the \"majority.\" Earlier on May 7, the Haryana government suffered a jolt when three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government, pushing the government into a minority. The three MLAs are Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri. All of them decided to extend support to Congress.\n\nHowever, the BJP appears confident of retaining power, with former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP. The development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nIn the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents. The BJP, which had 41 MLAs initially, was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs. Earlier, six out of seven Independent MLAs used to support the BJP. With three Independents withdrawing their support, the BJP at present, has the support of three Independents and one HLP MLA, making it a government of 43 MLAs.\n\nThe 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state go to the polls on May 25.

These three MLAs have also sent letters withdrawing their support from the government to the Governor.\n\nFollowing the resignations of Independent MLA Ranjit Chautala and former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar from the 90-member Haryana Assembly, the BJP now has only 40 MLAs out of 88. After the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) with 10 legislators withdrew their support in March, the BJP enjoyed the support of five Independent MLAs and the Haryana Lokhit Party legislator Gopal Kanda. So Chief Minister Saini led Government in Haryana now has the support of 43 out of 88 MLAs. The main opposition Congress has 30 MLAs while the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has one.\n\nLeader of Opposition and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda claimed that with the withdrawal of support by three independent MLAs, the BJP Government in Haryana has lost the majority. The Nayab Saini-led BJP Government is in a minority in Haryana. Hooda said that now the BJP government has lost the majority after the withdrawal of support from JJP and independents. Therefore, assembly elections should be conducted by immediately imposing President's rule in Haryana.\n\nAhead of the Lok Sabha polls in Haryana slated on May 25 in all 10 Parliamentary seats in the state, the Congress on Tuesday got a major shot in the arm as three Independent legislators extended their support to the grand old party.\n\nThe legislators are Somveer Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri, Randhir Golan from Pundri, and Dharampal Gondar from Nilokheri. They withdrew their support from the BJP.\n\nResponding to the development, senior Congress leader Hooda said the BJP government has lost majority after the withdrawal of support from the JJP and three Independents. \"The Assembly elections should be conducted immediately by imposing President's Rule in Haryana because today not only just the public but also the people who voted and supported the BJP are unhappy with the policies of the government,\" he told the media persons in Rohtak.\n\nThe three legislators announced their support while addressing the media in the presence of Hooda and state unit Congress president Chaudhary Udaibhan. The three MLAs have sent letters withdrawing their support from the government to the Governor.\n\nDuring the press conference, the Independent MLAs said in one voice that the public has tried BJP, and now there was no justification for giving an opportunity to it because every section is unhappy with unemployment, inflation, increasing crime, family ID, and property ID in this government. They said every class including farmers, laborers, employees, traders, sarpanch, numberdars are agitating today. They added that they tried to warn the BJP on different occasions while they were in the government, but BJP did not give up its stubbornness.\n\nThe MLAs said now the public's expectations are only from Congress. There is a wave of Congress's INDIA alliance in the entire country including Haryana. They assured that all three of them will play their part to make the alliance win and ensure the defeat of BJP.\n\nOn this occasion, Hooda expressed his gratitude to the three MLAs for their support and said the MLAs have taken this decision keeping in mind the public sentiments. \"Their right decision, taken at the right time, will definitely bear fruit. Congress's victory is certain in the Lok Sabha and upcoming assembly elections,\" he said.\n\nHe further said, \"BJP leaders and workers themselves are fed up with this government. This is the reason why many people are leaving BJP and joining Congress. Till now, more than 100 big leaders including 40 MLAs, former MLAs, MPs and former MPs have joined Congress from other parties in the last one and a half years.\"\n\nHaryana PCC president Chaudhary Udaibhan also welcomed the support of the three MLAs. He said often people leave the Opposition and go to the ruling party, but these MLAs have announced their decision to leave the ruling party, and support the opposition. \"It is clear that these MLAs have come forward with the aim of supporting the struggle. Their decision will definitely strengthen the Congress. With the withdrawal of support by 3 MLAs and JJP's exit from the government, it is clear that a minority government is running the state. In such a situation, BJP has no right to remain in power. Government should face assembly elections,\" he said.\n\nAfter Independent MLA Ranjit Chautala and former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar resigned from the 90-member Haryana assembly, the BJP has 40 MLAs out of 88 and Saini had won the trust vote after becoming chief minister in March. He is fighting the Karnal assembly by-election on May 25.", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pioneer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Chautala's letter came a day after he said he would back the Opposition Congress against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Haryana.\n\nThe development assumes significance amid a crisis of sorts that the Chief Minister Nayab Saini-led government is facing in Haryana after three independent lawmakers - Dharampal Gondher, Randhir Golan and Sombir Sangwan - withdrew support to the BJP government and instead decided to support the Congress.\n\nAll this is happening days ahead of the Lok Sabha polls to the 10 Haryana seats on May 25 and the state assembly elections scheduled to be held later this year.\n\nThe BJP, however, insists that the Nayab Saini-led Haryana government is safe. The ruling party said that even if the need arises, other MLAs will support its government to help it sail through.\n\nAlso Read: 'Ye jooth ka silsila...': Haryana CM Nayab Saini says 'people wont let Congress fulfil its wishes'\n\n\"There is no threat to our government. It will continue to serve the people. We shall win an absolute majority in the next Assembly elections, so that such a situation never arises again,\" former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar told reporters on May 8.\n\nWhat explains the BJP's confidence, though? In March this year, the Opposition Congress led by former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda moved a no-confidence motion against the Saini government. Saini won the motion.\n\nAt that time, the BJP had 41 MLAs in the 90-member Haryana assembly, after 10 MLAs of its ally, Dushyant Chautala-led JJP, decided to part ways. As many as six independent MLAs and one MLA of the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) backed the BJP government.\n\nAlso Read: Haryana news: Dushyant Chautala says Congress does not want to topple BJP govt 'due to ED, CBI cases'\n\nThe Congress party had 30 MLAs, the INLD one, while one independent MLA had abstained from voting. Since none of the JJP MLAs voted, the BJP could easily win the floor test.\n\nTwo no-confidence motions cannot be moved within six months, as per the rules. Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said that the motion could not be moved at this point, though he insisted that the chief minister should resign since the BJP government is in the minority now, according to a report in the Indian Express.\n\nAs things stand in the Haryana Assembly, the present strength of the house is 88 since two MLAs - former CM Manohar Lal Khattar and Ranjit Singh - have resigned. Khattar is the BJP candidate from the Karnal Lok Sabha seat, while Singh is contesting from Hisar in the upcoming general elections.\n\nIn the 88-member house, the BJP needs 45 MLAs for its government to stay. For now, it has 40 MLAs. The saffron party has the support of two independent MLAs and the lone HLP MLA, taking its tally to 43. With the claimed support of three of the JJP's 10 MLAs, the BJP's numbers go up to 46, one more than the magic number required in the Haryana assembly.\n\nAlso Read: Haryana crisis: Can Congress overthrow BJP govt as 3 independents switch sides?\n\nThese three JJP MLAs have already been served notice for 'anti-party' activities by the JJP. In case of disqualification from the House, the total strength will come down to 85 and so will the magic majority number to 43, a number that the BJP has.\n\nBoth parties have claimed they are in touch with many MLAs who can swing the figures either way.\n\nFor the Opposition to stake a claim, it needs to seek an appointment with the Governor of the state. Ideally, the Congress, the largest Opposition party in Haryana, should do it. But for now, the JJP has written to the Governor seeking a floor test. Leader of Opposition in Haryana Assembly had said on May 8 that even Dushyant Chautala could also do it. Now that he has done it, will the Congress follow suit? Remains to be seen.\n\nAlso Read: Haryana political crisis: 'BJP will win all ten Lok Sabha seats,' says former CM Manohar Lal Khattar| 10 updates\n\nAnd in case the Congress and the JJP meet the Governor staking a claim to form the government, the ball will be in the Governor's court then. The Governor might as well ask the BJP to prove the majority. In that scenario, the role of JJP MLAs will be key. Not necessarily that the BJP will be unable to win the floor test again.\n\nAlso, reports suggested that the Congress, for now, wants to focus on the Lok Sabha elections scheduled for May 25. The BJP had won all 10 seats in 2019. The grand old party can, anyway, shift the focus to state assembly after the general elections and close to assembly polls scheduled later this year.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Claiming that the BJP government is reduced to a minority, the Congress, on its part, demanded the imposition of the President's rule and early assembly elections in the state.\n\nHowever, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini asserted that his government is not in any trouble. His predecessor and party colleague M L Khattar also claimed that many MLAs are in touch with the BJP and there is \"nothing to worry \". Independent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support to the ruling BJP in Haryana on Tuesday and announced that they would back the Congress. Haryana Political Crisis: Congress Seeks Dismissal of CM Nayab Singh Saini Led-Government, Fresh Polls in State\n\nThe fast-paced political developments in the state come at a time when Lok Sabha polls are just a fortnight away and Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in October. Speaking to reporters in Hisar, Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala said if a no-confidence motion is brought in the Assembly, they will vote against the Saini government.\n\n\"I want to tell Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda that going by the present numbers in the Assembly, when this government is in a minority, if a step is taken that this government is brought down during (Lok Sabha) elections, then we will fully consider to support them in this from outside\". \"Now, the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the BJP government,\" Chautala said. Reacting to this, Congress leader Hooda said, \"They should write to the Governor (that government is in a minority)\".\n\nDushyant Chautala also ruled out reviving his party's alliance with the BJP. The two parties had snapped ties in March. \"I have made it quite clear that JJP will not go with BJP now,\" Chautala said and demanded that Saini should either prove majority or submit his resignation. The 90-member Haryana assembly at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member. Independents are six. Haryana: Three Independent MLAs Withdraw Support From BJP and Extend It To Congress, Bhupinder Singh Hooda Says CM Nayab Singh Saini-Led Government Has Lost Majority (Watch Video)\n\nThe government has the support of two of the Independent legislators. Independent MLA Nayan Pal Rawat said he had given unconditional support to the BJP in 2019 and it is continuing even now. \"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Chief Minister Saini told reporters at Sirsa while replying to queries on the withdrawal of support. However, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority and it has no moral right to stay in power.\n\nINLD's lone MLA Abhay Singh Chautala said that either the government should prove it has a majority or else \"Governor's rule should be imposed\". Hitting out at the Congress, Saini said the opposition party's actions are only aimed at fulfilling the personal aspirations of some people. But the people of Haryana will not let the Congress' designs succeed, the chief minister said, adding the entire country is witnessing the \"misdeeds\" of the opposition party.\n\nLater in Karnal, Saini said Congress has been rejected by various sections and is sinking. About the three Independent MLAs, Saini said, \"They are able legislators. How did fall into the (Congress) trap.... Four days ago I called them and spoke to them,\" said Saini. Former chief minister Khattar downplayed the developments.\"During election season, who is going where is not going to have much impact. Many MLAs are in touch with us also, so no one should worry about this,\" he told reporters in Karnal.\n\nIn Chandigarh, while replying to a question, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that the Saini government had won the trust vote on March 13. \"How can we say that the government is in a minority? It is intact and running as it was earlier,\" he told reporters. Asked if a no-confidence motion can be brought against the government, the Speaker said, \"Usually, when a no-confidence is brought, another one can only be brought six months after that. It is a technical matter.\"\n\nHaryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said the party will write to the governor stating that the Saini government is in a minority and that it should be dismissed, the President's Rule imposed in the state and fresh polls announced. The opposition party also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nAsked about some JJP MLAs indicating support to the BJP after his party pulled out of the coalition government in March, Dushyant Chautala said notices have been issued to three of them and they have been asked to submit a reply. He said his party MLAs are bound by whip and if anyone wants to extend support against the party line they will have to resign first. JJP MLAs Jogi Ram Sihag and Ram Niwas Surjakhera have extended support to the BJP in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. JJP's Devender Babli has also called a meeting of his supporters in Tohana on May 11 to decide on the future course of action. Sources said another JJP MLA Ram Karan Kala is also contemplating similar action.\n\nSaini had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister in March and the JJP's four-and-a-half-year-old post-poll alliance with BJP had come to an end. State Assembly polls in Haryana are due in October while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25 along with voting to the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana. Saini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com",

Three Independent MLAs who were supporting them have withdrawn their support and have written to the Governor. JJP has clearly said that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this government, we will support the motion. We have also written to the Governor about it. Now, Congress has to take this step (seeking a floor test). Congress will have to decide if they are going to take any steps to corner the current BJP government or not,\" Chautala told ANI.\n\nHe further said that the Governor should implement President's Rule in Haryana if the state government doesn't have the \"majority.\" \"The Governor has the power to order a floor test to see if the government has the strength and if it doesn't have the majority, immediately implement President's Rule in the state,\" he added.\n\nEarlier on May 7, the Haryana government suffered a jolt when three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government, pushing the government into a minority. The three MLAs are Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri. All of them decided to extend support to Congress. However, the BJP appears confident of retaining power, with former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP.\n\nThe development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar. In the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP, which had 41 MLAs initially, was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs. Earlier, six out of seven Independent MLAs used to support the BJP. With three Independents withdrawing their support, the BJP at present, has the support of three Independents and one HLP MLA, making it a government of 43 MLAs.\n\nThe 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state go to the polls on May 25.", "source": {"uri": "newsd.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsd.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charkhi_Dadri_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charkhi Dadri district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://newsd.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dushyant-chautala.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 16, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2825, "textEnd": 2831}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

This decision led to the reduction of the Nayab Singh Saini government to a minority in the state assembly.\n\nThe three Independent MLAs who withdrew their support from the BJP Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) announced their decision at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Congress sought the imposition of President's Rule followed by fresh elections in the state day after the Independent MLAs withdrew support. According to news agency PTI, the grand old party said it would write to Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya to demand that the saffron party government be dismissed. It also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nFollowing the latest development, the government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House which has a current strength of 88.\n\n\"We are going to write to the Governor that three Independent MLAs have withdrawn support and they have extended support to our party... the government is in the minority and they have no right to stay in power. We will demand that the government be dismissed, President's Rule be imposed and fresh elections be held,\" Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said, as quoted by PTI.\n\n\"Likewise, the JJP should also write a letter that the government be dismissed. INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu, who claim to be opposing the government, should also write similar letters to the Governor,\" he further stated. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House.\n\nVoting is set to be held in Haryana for the Lok Sabha elections on May 25 to elect 10 members of Parliament. In 2019, the saffron party swept the state and bagged all 10 seats.\n\nSpeaking on the political developments in the state and opposition's demand to dismiss the BJP government in the state, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that decision can not be taken only on their (opposition) demand. Technically, the situation which is same as it was one month ago.\n\n\"A decision can not be taken only on their (opposition) demand. Technically, the situation which is same as it was one month ago. Even today, BJP has 40 MLAs, Congress has 30 MLAs, 10 are of JJP, six are independent, and one MLA is of HLP and one MLA from INLD,\" Gupta said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said that his government is not in any trouble and working strongly. He blamed the Congress for creating the confusion that his government is in trouble. \"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Saini told reporters at Sirsa when asked to comment on the withdrawal of support, as quoted by PTI.\n\nSaini slammed the Congress and said that it has been the opposition party's thinking that it should fulfil the personal aspirations of some people. \"When they ruled at the Centre, you must have seen that when they felt their government was in trouble, they used to fulfil the aspirations of some people,\" he said, as quoted by PTI. But the people of Haryana are not going to fulfil the aspirations of the Congress, the chief minister added.\n\nSaini said the \"double-engine\" government has ensured development in various spheres in the country as well as in the state. \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP believe in development,\" he said. The Haryana CM said the entire country is witnessing the misdeeds of the Congress.\n\n\"The Congress knows that it cannot fulfil the aspirations of people and misleads them. It tries to create a state of confusion that the (state) government is in minority. The government is in no trouble and it is functioning strongly,\" he asserted, as quoted by PTI.\n\nOn Tuesday, Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said, \"The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government,\" as quoted by PTI.\n\nThe grand old party in a statement said that the three MLAs have already sent letters to the governor saying they have withdrawn their support to the government, as reported by PTI.\n\nMeanwhile, JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said Hooda should initiate the process to \"bring down the government which has lost trust of people\". He also said Hooda should immediately meet the governor and apprise him of the situation.\n\nHooda expressed his gratitude to the three MLAs for their support and said they have taken this decision keeping in mind the public sentiments. The leader of the opposition said there is a wave in favour of the Congress in the country including Haryana and that the Independent MLAs have taken this decision respecting the sentiments of people, as reported by PTI. He claimed people have made up their mind to form the Congress government in the state.\n\nThe Saini-led BJP government in Haryana had on March 13 won the trust vote by voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Manohar Lal Khattar. Recently, several MLAs of JJP have come out in support of the ruling BJP. Khattar, who is contesting Lok Sabha polls from Karnal, had resigned as MLA from Karnal.\n\nFormer Haryana minister Ranjit Singh Chautala also resigned in March as MLA. He was an Independent MLA from Rania segment and resigned on March 24 as he joined the BJP, which has announced his candidature for Hisar Lok Sabha seat.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com",

Here's What Number Game Suggests", "body": "In a surprising turn of events during the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government in Haryana finds itself teetering on the edge of the minority following the defection of three Independent MLAs to the Congress camp. In response, Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Wednesday asserted the stability of his government, despite the recent defections. This recent development has prompted urgent maneuvering from the Congress, scrambling to gather enough support to dismantle the Saini govt ahead of the state polls.\n\nThe crucial development came as Independent MLAs Sombir Sangawan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) announced their withdrawal from the BJP government during a press conference held in Rohtak. Standing alongside them were top Congress leaders, including Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and state Congress chief Udai Bhan.\n\nIs the BJP falling short of the majority mark? Can Congress pose a threat to the Saini-led government? Here's a rundown of the events that have unfolded since yesterday, and all that you need to know about the Haryana political crisis so far:\n\nHaryana CM Saini today asserted the stability of his government, stating that his administration is working strongly and is \"not in any trouble\". \"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.\n\nOpposition leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda countered this, urging the resignation of the government and advocating for the imposition of President's rule. \"The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government,\" he told reporters in a press conference.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, CM Saini had told reporters, reacting to the withdrawal by the three MLAs, \"have received this information. Some MLAs have their desires... Congress is fulfilling its desires, but people know everything. Congress is not concerned about the desires of people, but only about itself\".\n\nREAD | Haryana: 3 Independent MLAs Withdraw Support From Nayab Saini Govt, Congress Claims BJP 'Has Lost Majority'\n\nMeanwhile, former Haryana Chief Minister and BJP candidate from Karnal Lok Sabha Constituency, Manohar Lal Khattar warned the Congress party and expressed his confidence in the current government. \"First of all, they cannot defect to any other party, if they do so, their membership will be cancelled,\" he said, adding, \"This political battle will go long, many people are in touch with us, be it from Congress or JJP. They should take care of their home first\".\n\n\"If they want, they can come to the political battleground, we will see what happens. We will make sure that in the next election (of state assembly), we get a full majority so that such situations don't arise,\" Khattar told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"I have full faith that people of Haryana will make BJP victorious on Lok Sabha seats,\" he added.\n\nAdding a significant dimension to the current political situation, Haryana Speak Gian Chand Gupta indicated that a recent majority test, conducted at Hooda's behest, renders another unnecessary for the next six months. It is to be noted that the Nayab Singh Saini government had previously secured a vote of secured a vote of confidence shortly after assuming power in March.\n\nREAD | Haryana Political Crisis: Congress Says BJP Can't Run Minority Government, Speaker Responds\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of numerical strength in the 90-seat Haryana Assembly becomes essential in this scenario. With 88 current MLAs, the majority mark stands at 45. While the BJP falls short by two MLAs, the Congress possesses 30 legislators, augmented by the support of three Independents. Should the JJP align with Congress, the combined tally would reach 43, significantly undermining the incumbent government's position.\n\nBut the political crisis in Haryana has a twist, the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), a former ally of the BJP, has extended support to the Congress. This potentially poses a threat to the Saini-led government in the state.\n\n\"We will support a move to bring down the government. The Congress has to decide if it will make a move or note,\" JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala remarked.\n\n\"The CM at least admitted that he is weak today. I think such a CM, who admits he is weak, is not capable of heading the state on moral grounds,\" Dushyant Chautala, former Deputy Chief Minister of Haryana, told reporters today.\n\nThis follows the recent rift between the BJP and the JJP, which culminated in the BJP securing adequate support to surpass the majority mark, with 40 of its own MLAs and backing from three Independent MLAs.\n\nAmidst this political crisis, attention is drawn to the interesting dynamics within the Chautala family, which has historically wielded huge influence in Haryana's politics. The emergence of JJP, led by Dushyant Chautala, estranged nephew of INLD's Abhay Chautala, introduces a compelling narrative.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nTalking to reporters in Sirsa on Wednesday, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini asserted that his government was not in trouble and was working strongly.\n\n\"We are going to write to the Governor that three Independent MLAs have withdrawn support and they have extended support to our party... the government is in the minority and they have no right to stay in power. We will demand that the government be dismissed, President's Rule be imposed and fresh elections be held,\" Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said.\n\n\"Likewise, the JJP should also write a letter that the government be dismissed. INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu, who claim to be opposing the government, should also write similar letters to the Governor,\" he added.\n\nBhan said the three Independent MLAs have already written to the Governor regarding their withdrawal of support.\n\nSenior Congress leader B B Batra said the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), once an ally of the BJP in the state, should write to the Governor making it clear that they were not supporting the dispensation.\n\nOn Tuesday, JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda should initiate the process to \"bring down\" the Nayab Singh Saini government \"which has lost the trust of people\".\n\nReacting to Chautala's statement, Batra said, \"Let the JJP write a letter to the Governor stating that they are not supporting the BJP government... We may know this fact (that JJP is not supporting them) but let them give a letter stating the same.\n\n\"Like the three Independent MLAs wrote a letter to Governor stating they have withdrawn their support... The JJP should also do this,\" he said.\n\nThe three Independent MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) -- on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government in Haryana and announced they would back the Congress.\n\nSaini had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister in March and the JJP's four-and-a-half-year-old post-poll alliance with BJP had come to an end with Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala saying they will not be part of the new government headed by Saini.\n\nBJP's Jawahar Yadav said there was no danger to the BJP government in the state.\n\nHe said the Saini government won a trust vote on March 13 and if it has to prove its majority on the floor of the House, it will do so.\n\nThe government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member House which has a current strength of 88.\n\nAmong the three Independent MLAs who withdrew their support, Gollen fought as an Independent and defeated Congress party's Satbir Bhana in the 2019 Haryana assembly polls.\n\nHe had unsuccessfully fought the 2014 assembly polls on a BJP ticket. He had remained chairman of the Haryana Tourism Corporation.\n\nGonder defeated BJP nominee Bhagwan Das Kabirpanthi from the Nilokheri seat in the 2019 assembly polls. He had remained the chairman of the Haryana Forest Development Corporation.\n\nSangwan won the Dadri assembly seat by defeating JJP nominee Satpal Sangwan in the previous assembly elections. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly polls.\n\nIn recent days, some JJP MLAs have hinted at supporting the BJP. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. If the opposition seeks a no-confidence motion in the state assembly, the BJP may need JJP MLAs to abstain.\n\nAs the intervening period between holding two assembly sessions should not be more than six months, the governor will have to summon the House before September 13.\n\nState Assembly polls in Haryana are due in October while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25 along with voting to the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana.\n\nSaini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41.\n\nThe Saini-led BJP government in Haryana on March 13 won the trust vote by a voice vote in the House after he took oath as the new chief minister replacing Khattar.", "source": {"uri":

The development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nThe three MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Charkhi Dadri), Randhir Golan (Pundri),and Dharampal Gondar (Nilokheri) - said they have decided to withdraw support from the Saini government and extend support to the Congress during the elections. Nayab Singh Saini blamed the Congress for the decision of the MLAs.\n\n\"I have received this information. Maybe Congress is engaged in fulfilling some people's wishes now. Congress has nothing to do with the wishes of the public,\" Saini said. The three independent MLAs made the announcement at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.\n\nHooda said people do not trust the present government. \"Seeing that these people have taken back their support and have decided to support Congress,\" he said.\n\nLok Sabha polls in Haryana will be held on May 25 and the state will face polls later this year. The decision of three MLAs to withdraw support came on the day voting took place on 93 seats in the third phase of Lok Sabha polls. Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said he had seen reports and the party would respond after getting all the information.\n\n\"I got know about this, I saw that report but I don't have information on it...Our people will give you a statement when we get the information. None of our govts are in any danger...I am not even sure if the news is true or false,\" Puri told ANI. Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said the BJP has lost the majority in the Haryana assembly.\n\n\"The situation in the state (Haryana) is against BJP, change is definite in the state. BJP govt has lost the majority. Among the list of 48 MLAs they had given, few MLAs have resigned because they are fighting the Lok Sabha election and some independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP and have extended their support to Congress. So the minority MLAs have no right,\" Deepender Hooda told ANI. Randhir Golan, who is among the three MLAs who withdrew support, said there was high inflation and unemployment under the BJP government. \"For the last 4.5 years, we extended support to the BJP. Today unemployment and inflation are at their highest. Looking at this, we have withdrawn our support (from the government),\" he said.\n\nPraveen Attrey, Media Secretary to Haryana CM said three independent MLAs extending their support to Congress won't impact Haryana government. \"Today also Haryana government has majority and is safe. If you see the numbers, government has the support of 47 MLAs and because of this, the government is totally safe. If we talk from the legal point of view, no confidence motion can't be moved against Haryana government because earlier in the Vidhan Sabha Assembly, under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress had moved a no confidence motion which was dismissed so another no confidence motion can't be brought in for the next six months,\" he said.

In that event, it will need the support of two other MLAs - who are Gopal Kanda from Haryana Lokhit Party and an MLA from INLD.\n\nWhat's next in Haryana?\n\nOn Wednesday, the Congress sought the imposition of President's Rule in Haryana and called for fresh polls.\n\nThe party said it would write to Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya to demand that the BJP government be dismissed.\n\nIt also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nHaryana assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta told ANI that he has not received any official information from the governor so far.\n\n\"I have not received any official information so far...We have not received it yet...Once the Governor's communication comes to us, decision will be taken as per the situation,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilokheri_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nilokheri Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanwar_Pal_Gujjar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kanwar Pal Gujjar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirsa_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sirsa district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balraj_Kundu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balraj Kundu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Chand_Gupta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gian Chand Gupta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/05/20240508081508_hr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

With three Independents withdrawing their support, the BJP at present, has the support of three Independents and one HLP MLA, making it a government of 43 MLAs.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislative_assemblies_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State legislative assemblies of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charkhi_Dadri_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charkhi Dadri district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-09/f62kbqus_bhupinder-hooda_625x300_23_September_22.jpg?ver-20240506.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 2107, "textEnd": 2115}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Image Courtesy: X/@NayabSainiBJP\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Haryana is witnessing a political storm. The saffron party's former ally, the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), has upped the ante after three Independent MLAs switched their support from the ruling BJP to the Congress.\n\nJJP leader and former Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala has written to Governor Bandaru Dattatreya seeking a floor test against the Nayab Singh Saini government to prove majority in the state Assembly. The Opposition Congress has called for CM Saini's resignation, saying his government is in the minority.\n\nThe Haryana CM on Thursday (9 May) said that he is ready for the floor test, exuding confidence that there is no \"danger\" to his government.\n\nBut can the Opposition move a no-trust motion against the Saini government? We explain.\n\nJJP's Chautala writes to governor\n\nIn his letter to the Haryana governor on Wednesday (8 May), Chautala said the Saini government no longer enjoys a majority.\n\n\"I urge you to direct the appropriate authority to immediately call for a floor test to determine majority of government,\" he wrote.\n\nChautala also said that his party is \"open to backing any other political party for government formation.\"\n\nThe JJP leader called for imposing President's rule in Haryana if the BJP government fails to prove a majority on the House floor.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ex-Haryana deputy CM said that he would support the Congress \"from outside\" if the Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda takes steps to topple the BJP government.\n\nSpeaking to Indian Express, Chautala said, \"He (Congress' Hooda) has to approach the Governor and move forward. As part of the Opposition, we'll stand with them. Today, this government does not have a majority, which is why the CM should resign. We shall also be writing to the Governor and do our bit, but Bhupinder Hooda has to initiate it. We'll be part of a collective Opposition and vote against the present government.\n\nReacting to Chautala's statement, former Haryana CM Hooda told Indian Express, \"He is saying these things after staying in the BJP-led government for four-and-a-half years. If he isn't the BJP's B-Team, he should meet the Governor and parade his 10 MLAs, and then I shall send ours to the Raj Bhavan, led by MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra.\"\n\nThe BJP's alliance with JJP had collapsed in March over seat-sharing.\n\nWhat is the Congress doing?\n\nA Congress leader and deputy LoP in the Haryana Assembly, Aftab Ahmed, has sought the governor's appointment on 10 May to \"present a memorandum regarding the present political situation in the state\".\n\nThe Congress is demanding CM Saini's resignation on \"moral grounds\". It has also called for early elections.\n\nLoP Hooda, who is reportedly the architect of the crisis, and Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan were present at the press conference in Rohtak on Tuesday when three MLAs - Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) - said are withdrawing support from the BJP.\n\nBhan has said the Assembly elections in the state should be conducted simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls on 25 May. The Haryana Assembly polls are due for October.\n\nFormer Haryana CM ML Khattar has claimed many MLAs are in touch with the BJP and there is \"nothing to worry about\".\n\n\"The Congress and JJP shouldn't worry about us. Instead, they should first set their own houses in order. There is no threat to our government. It will continue to serve the people. We shall win an absolute majority in the next Assembly elections, so that such a situation never arises again,\" he was quoted as saying by Indian Express.\n\nCM Saini has expressed confidence that his government will win the no-trust vote.\n\nThe BJP says it has the support of four MLAs from the JJP.\n\nIn the 90-member Haryana Assembly, the BJP has 40 MLAs and is two short of the majority. the current strength of the House is 88 after Khattar and another Independent MLA resigned from the Assembly to contest Lok Sabha polls.\n\nAfter three Independent MLAs crossed sides on Tuesday, the Saini government has the support of 43 MLAs -- BJP 40, two Independents, and one from the Haryana Lokhit Party\n\n(HLP).\n\nThe Congress has 30 legislators and the support of three Independents. The JJP has a total of 10 MLAs. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has one MLA. To get past the majority mark of 45, the Congress needs the support of all JJP MLAs, and the lone MLAs of HLP and the INLD.\n\nHowever, the loyalties of four JJP MLAs could shift to the BJP, which claims their support . As per an NDTV report, four MLAs from Chautala's party met former CM Khattar in the afternoon on Thursday at the residence of Minister of State Mahipal Dhanda in Panipat.\n\nAs per the rules, a no-confidence motion cannot be moved within six months of the last one.\n\nA floor test was held in March after Khattar stepped down as CM and was replaced by Saini. A day after taking oath as the Haryana CM on 12 March, Saini had won the trust vote.\n\nSo, as of now, he has that six-month immunity.\n\nHooda agreed that the floor test could not be held currently. However, he told Indian Express that the \"Chief Minister should resign on moral grounds, as his government has lost majority\".\n\nThe Opposition can meet the governor and stake a claim to form the government. However, even if the Congress and the JJP display their strength of MLAs in front of the governor, it is not known what Dattatreya would do, noted Indian Express.\n\nHaryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta has reportedly said there was no need to conduct a floor test for another six months as it was held in March.\n\nAs per Indian Express, Gupta said, \"Officially, I have not received any intimation from any MLA. It is only in the media that there are reports that three Independent MLAs have decided to support the Congress. Usually, when a no-confidence motion is moved, the next one can only be moved after six months, although the Governor, as a constitutional authority, can take any decision as and when the need arises. If he gives us any directions, we will follow those.\"\n\nEven if the Haryana governor asks the Saini government to prove its majority within a certain period, the defection of some JJP MLAs remains a real possibility. If that happens, the BJP could easily win the no-trust motion, as per the newspaper.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

File picture.\n\nThe Congress on Thursday sought time to meet the Haryana governor in the wake of the situation arising out of three Independent MLAs withdrawing support to the BJP government, with Bhupinder Singh Hooda saying the \"minority\" dispensation should resign on moral grounds.\n\nSeeking time for its delegation to meet on Friday, a letter written by the Congress to the governor's office said that it wants to present a memorandum regarding the present political situation in the state.\n\nIt said that a Congress delegation led by Deputy CLP leader Aftab Ahmed, and B B Batra, chief whip CLP, and other Congress leaders want to meet the governor on May 10.\n\nThree Independent MLAs had withdrawn their support to the Nayab Singh Saini government in the state on Tuesday, after which the opposition claimed that it had reduced the government to a minority in the state assembly.\n\nHowever, Chief Minister Saini again asserted that his government was not in trouble.\n\nEarlier, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala wrote to Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya, saying the Saini government no longer commands a majority and sought an immediate floor test.\n\n\"We have also sought time from the governor,\" Leader of Opposition Hooda said when asked to comment on the JJP writing a letter to the governor.\n\nHooda was campaigning in Bhiwani for party's Lok Sabha candidate Rao Dan Singh.\n\nReplying to another question, Hooda said the Congress has 30 MLAs but in a reference to some JJP MLAs indicating their support in recent days to the BJP, he raised doubts whether all 10 JJP MLAs were onboard with their party.\n\n\"We are 30 MLAs...regarding JJP, it would have been better had they paraded 10 MLAs before the governor.\n\n\"There is no dispute about our MLAs. Some of their (JJP's) MLAs are supporting someone else...let them go to the governor with their 10 MLAs,\" he said.\n\nAfter withdrawal of support by the three Independents, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority.\n\n\"On moral grounds, it should resign. President's rule should be imposed...we are demanding fresh elections in the state,\" he said.\n\nTaking on both the BJP and the JJP whose alliance ended after Saini replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as Chief Minister in March, Hooda said, \"They entered into agreement to break the alliance.

This can only be proven in the Vidhan Sabha. Bhupinder Singh Hooda of the Congress is only misleading people,\" Yadav said speaking to ANI on Tuesday. Yadav said that conducting a trust vote in the Assembly in the next six months is difficult but they will be able to prove their majority if needed.\n\n\"On March 13, Nayab Singh Saini won the trust vote in the state assembly. Another trust vote within the next six months is difficult. If such a situation arises we will prove our majority,\" the BJP leader said. Hitting out at the Leader of Opposition, Yadav said, \"I would like to challenge Bhupinder Singh Hooda to come to the Assembly and prove his majority. The BJP government has the required majority and our Chief Minister is Nayab Singh Saini.\"\n\nThree Independent MLAs withdrew their support to the BJP in Haryana amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state. The three MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Charkhi Dadri), Randhir Golan (Pundri),and Dharampal Gondar (Nilokheri) - said they have decided to withdraw support from the Saini government and extend support to the Congress during the elections.\n\nIn the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents. The BJP which had 41 MLAs initially was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.\n\nEarlier six out of seven Independent MLAs used to support the BJP. With three Independents withdrawing their support, the BJP at present, has the support of three Independents and one HLP MLA, making it a government of 43 MLAs.

THe Independent MLAs are six.\n\nThe government has the support of two of the Independent legislators.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao_Dan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rao Dan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaudhary_Aftab_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chaudhary Aftab Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhiwani_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhiwani district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilokheri_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nilokheri Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_50_40_2945094.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1173, "textEnd": 1179}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Maybe Congress is engaged in fulfilling some people's wishes now. Congress has nothing to do with the wishes of the public,\" Saini said.\n\nThe three independent MLAs made the announcement at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.\n\nHooda said people do not trust the present government.\n\n\"Seeing that these people have taken back their support and have decided to support Congress,\" he said.\n\nLok Sabha polls in Haryana will be held on May 25 and the state will face polls later this year. The decision of three MLAs to withdraw support came on the day voting took place on 93 seats in the third phase of Lok Sabha polls.\n\nUnion Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said he had seen reports and the party would respond after getting all the information.\n\n\"I got know about this, I saw that report but I don't have information on it...Our people will give you a statement when we get the information. None of our govts are in any danger...I am not even sure if the news is true or false,\" Puri told ANI.\n\nCongress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said the BJP has lost the majority in the Haryana assembly.\n\n\"The situation in the state (Haryana) is against BJP, change is definite in the state. BJP govt has lost the majority. Among the list of 48 MLAs they had given, few MLAs have resigned because they are fighting the Lok Sabha election and some independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP and have extended their support to Congress. So the minority MLAs have no right,\" Deepender Hooda told ANI.\n\nRandhir Golan, who is among the three MLAs who withdrew support, said there was high inflation and unemployment under the BJP government. \"For the last 4.5 years, we extended support to the BJP. Today unemployment and inflation are at their highest. Looking at this, we have withdrawn our support (from the government),\" he said.\n\nPraveen Attrey, Media Secretary to Haryana CM said three independent MLAs extending their support to Congress won't impact Haryana government.\n\n\"Today also Haryana government has majority and is safe. If you see the numbers, government has the support of 47 MLAs and because of this, the government is totally safe. If we talk from the legal point of view, no confidence motion can't be moved against Haryana government because earlier in the Vidhan Sabha Assembly, under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress had moved a no confidence motion which was dismissed so another no confidence motion can't be brought in for the next six months,\" he said.

The decision to withdraw support and extend it to the Congress was announced by Gonder, as reported by Hindustan Times.\n\nJJP Calls For Haryana Government Toppling\n\n\"This decision has been taken on various issues, including those related to farmers,\" he explained. The announcement was made in the presence of former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan.\n\nUdai Bhan highlighted the diminishing strength of the ruling government, stating, \"The current strength of the Haryana Assembly, which is 88 members, includes 40 BJP members.

At a press conference in Hisar, Chautala categorically said that his party would \"consider\" offering outside support to the Congress if it made any efforts to topple the government during the ongoing Lok Sabha election. \"It's now for the Congress to decide whether it takes any step to bring down the government or not,\" Chautala said.\n\nResponding to the offer, senior Congress leader and two-time Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the JJP must write to the Governor saying that it is not supporting the BJP. \"Soon our delegation will call upon the Haryana Governor, seeking imposition of President's Rule and fresh elections to the State assembly,\" Hooda said.\n\nRegarding the fact that three of the JJP's 10 MLAs have been seen at the BJP's election rallies, Chautala said that show-cause notices had been served to them, but no replies were received so far. He added that the party had evidence against them in the form of videos, posters and pictures for indulging in anti-party activities.\n\nChautala, however, added that they were bound to abide by the party's whip in case a no-confidence motion was brought against the present government. He said that his party would vote against the government in that case.\n\nThe former Hisar Lok Sabha MP also demanded that Chief Minister Nayab Saini resign on moral grounds after his government was reduced to a \"minority\", or prove his majority. Chautala added that his party would also write to the Governor seeking directions to the BJP government to prove its majority on the floor of the House.\n\nThe effective strength of the 90-member Haryana Assembly stands at 88 after former Chief Minister Manohar Lal and Independent MLA Ranjit Chautala resigned from the Karnal and Rania Assembly seats over the past few weeks for different reasons. This has brought the majority mark down to 45 MLAs.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of support by three Independent MLAs - Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Golan (Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) - the BJP government now has the support of only 43 MLAs, including two Independents and the Haryana Lokhit Party's lone MLA Gopal Kanda. The BJP itself has 40 MLAs at present, with the byelection for the Karnal Assembly seat slated for May 25.\n\nSaini rubbished the Opposition's claim of his government being reduced to a \"minority\", insisting that the BJP government was \"safe\" and \"functioning with full strength\". He accused the Congress of trying to mislead people and creating a misconception about the stability of the government. \"The people of the State are not going to fulfil the wishes of the Congress since the Congress believes in corruption. On the other hand, [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and the BJP believe in development,\" Saini told journalists in Haryana's Jind on the sidelines of a rally in support of the party's Sirsa candidate Ashok Tanwar.\n\nThe CM also accused the Congress of luring the three Independent MLAs, saying that he had met them four days ago and they were good people, but were somehow coaxed into withdrawing their support.\n\nSaini said that three independent MLAs, who withdrew their support to the BJP government, are good people, but they are stuck while recalling a recent meeting with them.\n\n\"...Sometime ago, trust vote happened...Congress has not been able to fulfil the wishes of the people. For their own benefit, they (Congress) fulfil the wishes of some people. Those MLAs are good people but they are stuck. I called and had a meeting with them four days ago,\" CM Saini told reporters here.\n\nLashing out at the Congress, CM Saini added, \"Encouraging corruption is Congress's thinking. Whenever there is corruption, the pace of development slows down. Whoever is involved in corruption, will not be spared,\" he added.\n\nThe Haryana government was reduced to a minority on Tuesday after three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini-led BJP government.\n\nIndependent MLA Dhharampal Gonder from Niolkheri said that he would extend support to Congress from outside.\n\n\"Three MLAs have withdrawn support from the Haryana government. During the election campaign in Nilokheri and other places, we were not invited...After this, the public started questioning us about why we weren't called. It was an insult to us. The public asked us not to extend support from now on...We did not want any ministerial posts; we just wanted to work for the people of the state.

The two parties had snapped ties in March.\n\n\"I have made it quite clear that JJP will not go with BJP now,\" Chautala said and demanded that Saini should either prove majority or submit his resignation.\n\nThe 90-member Haryana assembly at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member. Independents are six.\n\nThe government has the support of two of the Independent legislators.\n\nIndependent MLA Nayan Pal Rawat said he had given unconditional support to the BJP in 2019 and it is continuing even now.\n\n\"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Chief Minister Saini told reporters at Sirsa while replying to queries on the withdrawal of support.\n\nHowever, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority and it has no moral right to stay in power.\n\nINLD's lone MLA Abhay Singh Chautala said that either the government should prove it has a majority or else \"Governor's rule should be imposed\".\n\nHitting out at the Congress, Saini said the opposition party's actions are only aimed at fulfilling the personal aspirations of some people. But the people of Haryana will not let the Congress' designs succeed, the chief minister said, adding the entire country is witnessing the \"misdeeds\" of the opposition party.\n\nLater in Karnal, Saini said Congress has been rejected by various sections and is sinking.\n\nAbout the three Independent MLAs, Saini said, \"They are able legislators. How did fall into the (Congress) trap.... Four days ago I called them and spoke to them,\" said Saini.\n\nFormer chief minister Khattar downplayed the developments.\"During election season, who is going where is not going to have much impact. Many MLAs are in touch with us also, so no one should worry about this,\" he told reporters in Karnal.\n\nIn Chandigarh, while replying to a question, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that the Saini government had won the trust vote on March 13.\n\n\"How can we say that the government is in a minority? It is intact and running as it was earlier,\" he told reporters.\n\nAsked if a no-confidence motion can be brought against the government, the Speaker said, \"Usually, when a no-confidence is brought, another one can only be brought six months after that. It is a technical matter.\"\n\nHaryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said the party will write to the governor stating that the Saini government is in a minority and that it should be dismissed, the President's Rule imposed in the state and fresh polls announced.\n\nThe opposition party also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nAsked about some JJP MLAs indicating support to the BJP after his party pulled out of the coalition government in March, Dushyant Chautala said notices have been issued to three of them and they have been asked to submit a reply.\n\nHe said his party MLAs are bound by whip and if anyone wants to extend support against the party line they will have to resign first.\n\nJJP MLAs Jogi Ram Sihag and Ram Niwas Surjakhera have extended support to the BJP in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. JJP's Devender Babli has also called a meeting of his supporters in Tohana on May 11 to decide on the future course of action. Sources said another JJP MLA Ram Karan Kala is also contemplating similar action.\n\nSaini had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister in March and the JJP's four-and-a-half-year-old post-poll alliance with BJP had come to an end.\n\nState Assembly polls in Haryana are due in October while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25 along with voting to the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana.\n\nSaini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41.", "source": {"uri":

State Congress leaders have sought a meeting with the governor. JJP had demanded President's rule and a no confidence motion, adding to the political uncertainty. In Haryana, the ruling BJP seems vulnerable amid an ongoing political upheaval after three independent MLAs withdrew support a few days ago. As the Congress spots an opportunity to topple the BJP government, an 'Operation Panja' could be in the works. Shadi Lal Kapoor, Secretary to the Leader of Opposition and former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, today wrote to the Haryana Governor, seeking a meeting with a Congress delegation tomorrow. The Congress is likely to demand a floor test since it believes the BJP government in minority now.\n\nThree independent MLAs -Somveer Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri, Randhir Singh Golan from Pundri and Dharampal Gondar - from Nilokheri announced their decision to withdraw support from the Nayab Singh Saini-led BJP government in Rohtak on Tuesday. They made this announcement in a press conference in the presence of former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana PCC chief Udai Bhan.\n\nSaini became the CM less than two months ago, replacing Manohar Lal Khattar. Reacting to the development, he said, \"I have received this information. Maybe Congress is engaged in fulfilling some people's wishes now. Congress has nothing to do with the wishes of the public.\"\n\nStating that the situation in Haryana is against the BJP and \"change is definite\", Hooda said: \"The BJP government has lost the majority. Among the list of 48 MLAs they had given, few MLAs have resigned because they are fighting the Lok Sabha election and some independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP and have extended their support to Congress. So the minority MLAs have no right.\"\n\nTo add to the BJP's predicament, its former ally JJP has said it will vote against the BJP. Former Haryana deputy CM and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala wrote to the governor today, asking for a floor test. He stated that if the government lacks the majority, President's rule should be immediately implemented in the state. He said that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against the government, his party will support the motion, and added that it was now up to the Congress to seek a floor test.\n\nThe BJP government had passed a floor test two months ago and many believe that another floor test can't happen within six months. However, it is up to the governor to decide.\n\nThe 90-member assembly now has an effective strength of 88 after former CM Manohar Lal Khattar and Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala resigned to contest in the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe BJP currently has 40 MLAs, Congress 30, JJP 10, and INLD and HLP (Gopal Kanda) one each. There are six independents. Saini said he was confident that the withdrawal of support by three Independents would have no bearing on the government's future. \"The public understands the intentions of such people,\" he said.\n\nRam Narain Yadav, retired additional secretary of the assembly, has told TOI that the Congress-led opposition would need to produce letters of support to show the government had lost its majority and seek a fresh trust vote. \"If the governor is convinced that the opposition has sufficient numbers, only then can he ask the government to go through a trial of strength again,\" he said. He said there was no bar on bringing a second no-confidence motion within six months of the first one.\n\nReportedly, the BJP's former ally Dushyant Chautala's JJP, which helped the BJP pass the floor test by abstaining the last time, might be facing a split in his party. Two MLAs from JJP - Ramniwas Surjakhera and Jogi Ram Sihag - recently defied Chautala to declare their support for BJP candidates in the Lok Sabha polls. The presence of a few more disgruntled MLAs in the JJP gives the BJP hope that should there be another floor test, it would sail through.\n\n(With inputs from TOI)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilokheri_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nilokheri Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somveer_Sangwan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Somveer Sangwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charkhi_Dadri_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charkhi Dadri district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udai_Bhan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Udai Bhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogi_Ram_Sihag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jogi Ram Sihag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranjit Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109986190,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-40518,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Independent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support to the ruling BJP in Haryana on Tuesday and announced that they would back the Congress, which claimed that the Saini government is reduced to a minority and demanded the imposition of President's rule.\n\nThe fast-paced political developments in the state come at a time when Lok Sabha polls are just a fortnight away and Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in October. Speaking to reporters in Hisar, Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala said if a no-confidence motion is brought against the Saini government, they will vote against the government.\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024: Read all the live updates here\n\n\"I want to tell Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda that going by the present numbers in the Assembly, when this government is in a minority, if a step is taken that this government is brought down during (Lok Sabha) elections, then we will fully consider to support them in this from outside\". \"Now, Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the BJP government,\" Chautala said.\n\nHe also ruled out reviving his party's alliance with the BJP. The two parties had snapped ties in March. \"I have made it quite clear that JJP will not go with BJP now,\" Chautala said and demanded that Saini should either prove majority or submit his resignation.\n\nThe 90-member Haryana assembly at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member. Independents are six. The government has the support of two of the Independent legislators.\n\n\"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Chief Minister Saini told reporters at Sirsa while replying to queries on the withdrawal of support. The chief minister was in Sirsa to campaign for BJP candidate Ashok Tanwar.\n\nHitting out at the Congress, Saini said the opposition party's actions are only aimed at fulfilling the personal aspirations of some people. But the people of Haryana will not let the Congress' designs succeed, the chief minister said, adding the entire country is witnessing the \"misdeeds\" of the opposition party.\n\n\"The Congress knows that it cannot fulfil the aspirations of people and misleads them. It tries to create confusion that the (state) government is in a minority. The government is in no trouble and it is functioning strongly,\" he asserted. In Chandigarh, while replying to a question, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that the Saini government had won the trust vote on March 13.\n\n\"How can we say that the government is in minority? It is intact and running as it was earlier,\" he told reporters. Asked if a no-confidence motion can be brought against the government, the Speaker said, \"Usually, when a no-confidence is brought, another one can only be brought six months after that. It is a technical matter.\"\n\nHaryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said the party will write to the governor stating that the Saini government is in a minority after the three Independent MLAs withdrew support to it and that it should be dismissed, President's Rule imposed in the state and fresh polls announced. It also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nAsked about some JJP MLAs indicating support to the BJP after his party pulled out of the coalition government in March, Chautala said notices have been issued to three of them and they have been asked to submit a reply.

Some of their (JJP's) MLAs are supporting someone else...let them go to the governor with their 10 MLAs,\" he said.\n\nAfter withdrawal of support by the three Independents, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority.\n\n\"On moral grounds, it should resign. President's rule should be imposed...we are demanding fresh elections in the state,\" he said.\n\nTaking on both the BJP and the JJP whose alliance ended after Saini replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as Chief Minister in March, Hooda said, \"They entered into agreement to break the alliance. People understand this.\" People know there is a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP (in the Lok Sabha polls), others are \"vote kaatu\" (vote-cutting) parties.\n\n\"When they (JJP) entered into a (post-poll) alliance (with BJP in 2019), I had said even then that it is not based on any policies, but selfish interests,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hooda, a former chief minister, said there is a wave blowing in favour of the Congress and exuded confidence that the INDIA bloc will win all 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana.\n\nJJP leader Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said that the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the \"minority\" BJP government.\n\nReacting to this, Hooda Wednesday said, \"They should write to the governor (that government is in a minority)\".\n\nIndependent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support to the ruling BJP in Haryana on Tuesday and announced that they would back the Congress.\n\nThe 90-member Haryana assembly at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant.

BJP's ex-ally Dushyant Chautala now wants to prove majority after 3 MLAs jump ship", "body": "'JJP has clearly said if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this Government, we will support the Motion,' Dushyant Chautala said read more\n\nHaryana's former deputy chief minister and ex-ally of Bharatiya Janata Party, Dushyant Chautala, has written to the Governor demanding a floor test in the Assembly after three independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP in the coalition government in the state.\n\nIn his letter to the Haryana Governor, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Chautala said the resignations of the independent and withdrawal of support by three independent MLAs have pushed the ruling BJP alliance to a minority status.\n\n\"The government that was formed two months back is now in the minority&mldr; Three Independent MLAs who were supporting them have withdrawn their support&mldr; JJP has clearly said if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this Government, we will support the Motion. We have also written to the Governor about it,\" Chautala said.\n\n\"Now, Congress has to take this step (seeking a Floor Test). The Governor has the power to order a Floor Test to see if the Government has the strength and if it doesn't have the majority immediately implement President's Rule in the state,\" the JJP leader further said.\n\nThe Nayab Singh Saini-led Haryana government had been reduced to a minority after three independent MLAs - Sombir Sangwan (from Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (from Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (from Nilokheri), cut support for the ruling BJP in the state.\n\nThey made the announcement during a press conference on Tuesday which was also attended by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly, and Udai Bhan, the state Congress chief.\n\nThe 90-seat Haryana Assembly's strength is reduced to 88 currently after two MLAs - former BJP CM Manohar Lal Khattar and independent MLA Ranjit Sinfh Chautala - resigned earlier to contest the Lok Sabha elections 2024.\n\nThe majority mark in the Haryana Assembly is currently at 45.\n\nBJP has 40 MLAs supported by three out of six independent lawmakers, signalling that the ruling coalition is short of two MLAs to have the majority.\n\nThe party also claimed on Tuesday that four JJP MLAs may offer \"tactical assistance to the government if needed\", taking its strength to 47.\n\nThe Congress party, meanwhile, claims 30 MLAs with its count increased by three independent candidates. If the JJP supports Congress, the grand old party's tally would increase to 43 MLAs. This scenario leaves two MLAs unaligned-one from the Haryana Lokhit Party and the other from the INLD.\n\nA couple of months back, the BJP severed ties with the JJP, whose 10 MLAs had helped it form the government in 2019. Of the JJP's 10 MLAs, at least six have distanced themselves from Chautala.\n\nAssembly polls in Haryana are due later this year. With the turn of political events, Haryana Congress president Udai Bhan demanded that state elections be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls on May 25.\n\n\"Saini has no right to stay in government for even a moment,\" Bhan had said.\n\nMeanwhile, CM Saini accused the Congress of engineering what had happened. \"Some MLAs have some ambitions. These days, Congress is apparently fulfilling the desires (of such people). People understand this. They also know who has what ambitions. The Congress has nothing to do with the needs of the people. They care only about their ambitions,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udai_Bhan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Udai Bhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-09-at-13.55.47_bc642019-2024-05-acbff7c2775e5da1325093aa973605d1-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2988, "textEnd": 2994}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Today also Haryana government has a majority and is safe. If you see the numbers, the government has the support of 47 MLAs and because of this, the govt is safe,\" he said.\n\nAttrey further said that under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress had moved a no-confidence motion earlier which was dismissed so another no-confidence motion can't be brought for the next 6 months. \"If we talk from the legal point of view, a no-confidence motion can't be moved against the Haryana government because earlier in the Vidhan Sabha Assembly, under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress had moved a no-confidence motion which was dismissed so another no-confidence motion can't be brought in for the next 6 months,\" he said.\n\nThe three MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Charkhi Dadri), Randhir Golan (Pundri), and Dharampal Gondar (Nilokheri) - said they have decided to withdraw support from the Saini government and extend support to the Congress during the elections. The development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said the BJP has lost the majority in the Haryana assembly. \"The situation in the state (Haryana) is against BJP, change is definite in the state. BJP govt has lost the majority. Among the list of 48 MLAs they had given, few MLAs have resigned because they are fighting the Lok Sabha election and some independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP and have extended their support to Congress. So the minority MLAs have no right,\" Deepender Hooda told ANI.\n\nNayab Singh Saini blamed the Congress for the decision of the MLAs. \"I have received this information. Maybe Congress is engaged in fulfilling some people's wishes now. Congress has nothing to do with the wishes of the public,\" Saini said.\n\nThe three independent MLAs made the announcement at a press conference in Rohtak in the presence of former Haryana CM Hooda. Randhir Golan, who is among the three MLAs who withdrew support, said there was high inflation and unemployment under the BJP government. \"For the last 4.5 years, we extended support to the BJP. Today unemployment and inflation are at their highest. Looking at this, we have withdrawn our support (from the government),\" he said.\n\nIn Haryana there are a total of 90 assembly seats, out of which BJP had 41, Congress 30, Jan Nayak Janata Party 10, Haryana Lokhit Party and Indian National Lok Dal 1 seat each and seven seats are represented by independents. Out of seven independent MLAs, earlier six supported the BJP. But now, three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support.\n\nCurrently, Karnal and Raniya seats that were represented by the BJP are vacant.

The three have withdrawn support from the Nayab Singh Saini-led BJP government, reducing it to a minority. However, the government remains in a safe zone for the time being as the opposition cannot call in the no-trust motion till mid-September, thanks to the rule that six months should elapse before a new trust motion can be introduced. The Saini government had won the confidence motion it brought on March 14.\n\nThe ruling BJP has the support of 43 MLAs in the 90-member House (current strength of 88). Apart from 40 of its own, it has the support of two independent MLAs and one MLA of the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) - Gopal Kanda. Since the majority mark is 45, the BJP is now two short of a majority.\n\nMeanwhile, it would also be unfair to say that the Opposition Congress has the majority despite these three MLAs extending their support. Presently, Congress has 30 MLAs. Three makes it 33. And although Dushyant Chautala has extended the support of its 10 Janayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs, it is a treacherous proposition. At least four JJP MLAs have rebelled against the party leadership and are inclined towards the BJP. In the case of a no-confidence motion, they are likely to favour the Saini government.\n\nAs a result, Chief Minister Saini has downplayed the crisis and said there was no threat to his government as it had ample support. He alleged that Congress was desperate for power and indulging in dirty politics.\n\nAt the same time, even though Congress is in no position to form a government, it will certainly like to build up the rhetoric around the BJP being a \"minority or illegal government\" and take some mileage out of it in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. Of the 10 seats in Haryana, Congress did not win even a single seat in 2019. Bhupinder Singh Hooda would like to have better figures this time.\n\nBesides, the assembly elections in the state are due later this year. It makes no sense for Congress to even try forming the government for a couple of months. Congress would serve its purpose better if it goes to the people highlighting the shortcomings of the BJP government which has been in power for the last 10 years.\n\nThe Congress on Wednesday demanded implementation of the President's Rule in the state.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandeep_yadav@news9live.com", "name": "Sandeep Yadav", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Haryana-New-CM-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-14", "textStart": 602, "textEnd": 610}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

In a letter to the governor, Chautala sought his intervention under Article 174, as the Nayab Singh Saini government does not command a majority.\n\n\"The Nayab Saini government was formed with the support of six Independents. While three have withdrawn support, one Independent MLA resigned from the House and his resignation was accepted on April 30.

He said 45 of the 88 legislators in the Assembly -- 30 of the Congress, 10 of the JJP, three independent legislators who have switched sides to the Congress, an independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, and INLD MLA Abhey Chautala were against the government.\n\n- Earlier, Independent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support for the BJP government and announced that they would back the Congress.\n\n- Amid the ongoing political developments in the state, Chief Minister Saini clarified that his government was not in any trouble. His predecessor, Manohar Lal Khattar, and colleagues claimed that many MLAs were in touch with the BJP and there was \"nothing to worry about\".\n\nCongress candidate from Rohtak Lok Sabha constituency, Deepender Singh Hooda, said that after the three independent MLAs withdrew their support, the government in the state has come into a minority and should resign immediately.\n\n- The crisis in the state comes within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\n- In the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the

They have now extended support to the Congress, reducing the Nayab Singh Saini government to a minority in the state assembly.\n\nIndependent MLAs Sombir Sangwan from Dadri, Randhir Singh Gollen from Pundri, and Dharampal Gonder from Nilokheri declared their stance at a press briefing in Rohtak. This announcement was made in the presence of Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and State Congress Chief Udai Bhan.\n\n\"The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government,\" Hooda said.\n\nJJP Calls For Haryana Government Shake-Up Amid BJP Alliance Challenges\n\nWhy the three MLAs have withdrawn the support?\n\nGonder said this decision was made due to various issues, including those concerning farmers, inflation, and unemployment.\n\nHow do numbers stack up?\n\nIn the 90-member assembly, the BJP has 40 MLAs and the magic number is 46. However, the current strength of the assembly is 88. So, the BJP requires two more MLAs to rule the state for six more months as the state polls are scheduled to be held in October.\n\nThe Congress has 30 seats.

The government is in no trouble and it is functioning strongly,\" he asserted.\n\nIn Chandigarh, while replying to a question, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that the Saini government had won the trust vote on March 13.\n\n\"How can we say that the government is in minority? It is intact and running as it was earlier,\" he told reporters Asked if a no-confidence motion can be brought against the government, the Speaker said, \"Usually, when a no-confidence is brought, another one can only be brought six months after that. It is a technical matter.\" Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said the party will write to the governor stating that the Saini government is in a minority after the three Independent MLAs withdrew support to it and that it should be dismissed, President's Rule imposed in the state and fresh polls announced.\n\nIt also asked the JJP, the INLD and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu to write similar letters to the governor to give credence to their claim of opposing the BJP.\n\nAked about some JJP MLAs indicating support to the BJP after his party pulled out of the coalition government in March, Chautala said notices have been issued to three of them and they have been asked to submit a reply.\n\nHe said his party MLAs are bound by whip and if anyone wants to extend support to anyone else they will have to resign first.\n\nSaini had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister in March and the JJP's four-and-a-half-year-old post-poll alliance with BJP had come to an end.\n\nState Assembly polls in Haryana are due in October while the Karnal Assembly bypoll is scheduled for May 25 along with voting to the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana.\n\nSaini, the MP from Kurukshetra in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is the BJP candidate for the bypolls and if he wins, the party's strength in the Assembly will rise to 41.

BJP government has lost the majority. Among the list of 48 MLAs they had given, few MLAs have resigned because they are fighting the Lok Sabha election and some independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP and have extended their support to Congress. So the minority MLAs have no right,\" Hooda said.\n\nThe recent withdrawal of support by independent MLAs from the Saini government in Haryana was reportedly due to their dissatisfaction over not being included in the administration.\n\nIndependent MLA Randhir Gollen said, \"We were elected as Independent as we honestly extended support to the BJP, but today, inflation and unemployment are at their peak, farmers and labourers are suffering. Seeing all this, we have withdrawn our support,\" reported PTI.\n\n\"Saini should tender his resignation as he does not have the right to stay even for a minute,\" said Congress party's Udai Bhan.\n\nHaryana CM Nayab Singh Saini Lashes Out at Congress\n\nHaryana CM Nayab Singh Saini strongly reacted to this development and slammed the Congress, saying, \"party is just fulfilling some people's wishes and has nothing to do with the public\".\n\n\"I have received this information.

The three MLAs are Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri. All of them decided to extend support to Congress. However, the BJP appears confident of retaining power, with former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP.\n\nThe development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar. In the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP, which had 41 MLAs initially, was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.

With the withdrawal of support, the Saini government in Haryana has reportedly reduced to minority. All three independent MLAs- Randhir Golam (Pundri), Dharmpal Gondar (Nilokheri) and Somveer Sangwan (Charkhi Dadri) have announced their support to Congress.\n\nLeader of Opposition and former Haryana CM Bhoopinder Singh Hooda met the three MLAs and welcomed the legislators into the Congress fold. The three MLAs reportedly said they weren't happy with the working of the Saini government and that's why they withdrew their support.\n\nThe number game has become tricky for the BJP in in Haryana assembly after the withdrawal of support by three independent legislators. Haryana Assembly has 90 seats and the majority mark is 46.\n\nBJP has 41 MLAs and they have the support of six independents with them. Now, after the withdrawal of support by three MLAs, the Nayab Singh Saini government in Haryana is left with only 44 MLAs, two short of the majority mark. The setback to the BJP in Haryana comes amid the ongoing Lok Sabha elections 2024. Haryana votes for 10 Lok Sabha seats on June 1 in the seventh and final phase.\n\nAmid the political storm in Haryana, the seven out of 10 disgruntled MLAs may announced their support to BJP government.

However, the move by independent MLAs shows the growing political clout of the Congress in the state.\n\nThree independent legislators -- Sombir Sangwan from Dadri, Randhir Singh Gollen from Pundri and Dharampal Gonder from Nilokheri -- announced on Tuesday evening that they were switching sides to support the Congress. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the leader of opposition in the Haryana assembly, and party's State unit chief Udai Bhan, were also at the press meet at Rohtak.\n\nHaryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta clarified that on the demand of the leader of opposition, Hooda, a majority test was conducted earlier on the floor of the assembly and, therefore, there was no need to conduct it for another six months. A day after being sworn in as the Haryana CM on March 12, Saini had won the trust vote.\n\nBJP sources said by the time the six-month cap is over, it will be time to face the assembly elections in the State.\n\nGround situation\n\nThe BJP, with its 40 MLAs in the 90-seat Haryana assembly, is two short of the majority figure as it continues to enjoy the support of the remaining three of the six independent MLAs. The current strength of the assembly is 88 owing to vacancies arising, including the resignation of former CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who is now contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Karnal.\n\nOn the other hand, the Congress has 30 legislators and with the support of three Independents its tally goes up to 33. For the Congress to get past the magic figure of 45, it has to have the entire support of 10 legislators of the JJP, and also from lone MLAs of Haryana Lokhit Party and the INLD as well.\n\nJJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister, Dushyant Chautala, who had been supporting the BJP for some years, said his party had extended support to the Congress given that the BJP government has lost the trust of the people of Haryana. \"The Congress has to decide if it will make a move or not,\" he said.\n\nDeepender Singh Hooda, son of Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Congress candidate from Rohtak Lok Sabha seat, said, the BJP government in Haryana is in the minority as of now. \"After this alliance broke, they (BJP) went to the Governor and gave a list of 48 MLAs. Out of 48, two MLAs, Ranjit Singh Chautala and Manohar Lal Khattar, who are contesting the Lok Sabha elections, have resigned. Today, their (BJP) number has come down to only 42. Naib Singh's government has no moral right to stay in power. They should resign on moral grounds and elections should be held again by imposing President's rule in the state impartially,\" he remarked.\n\n.\n\nAAP is contesting only from the Kurukshetra Lok Sabha constituency, while Congress has put up candidates for the rest of the nine seats. Interestingly, BSP which fought on all the seats in the previous election, has so far announced candidature in one seat only.\n\nSHARE Copy

The political crisis unfolded as three independent MLAs, who were earlier supporting the state government, have now withdrawn their support. While pulling out their support, the three legislators - Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Gollen and Dharampal Gonder - announced that they had decided to extend support to the Congress.\n\nThe MLAs made the startling announcement in a press conference in Haryana's Rohtak in the presence of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan. All three cited reasons such as high unemployment, inflation and misgovernance by the current chief minister as their reason behind pulling out the hands.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress claimed that the BJP had lost the majority in the Haryana assembly.\n\n\"The situation in the state (Haryana) is against BJP, change is definite in the state. BJP govt has lost the majority. Among the list of 48 MLAs they had given, few MLAs have resigned because they are fighting the Lok Sabha election and some independent MLAs withdrew their support to BJP and have extended their support to Congress. So the minority MLAs have no right,\" Deepender Hooda told ANI.\n\nHowever, the Bharatiya Janata Party has claimed that their government is safe with the required number of MLAs in support of Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini.\n\n\"Three independent MLAs extending their support to Congress won't impact Haryana govt. Today also Haryana govt has a majority and is safe. If you see the numbers, govt has the support of 47 MLAs and because of this, the govt is totally safe. If we talk from the legal point of view, a confidence motion can't be moved against the Haryana govt because earlier in the Vidhan Sabha Assembly, under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress had moved a no-confidence motion which was dismissed so another no-confidence motion can't be brought in for the next 6 months,\" Praveen Attrey, Media Secretary to Haryana CM said while speaking to the ANI.\n\nThe legislative assembly of Haryana has a total of 90 Vidhansabha constituencies. Currently, two of them are vacant as two MLAs - Manohar Lal Khattar and Ranjit Singh Chautala - resigned even before the completion of the term. The total strength thus stands at 88, out of which the majority marks stands at 45. Currently, the ruling NDA has the support of 42 members, with BJP itself having 40 MLAs, whereas, it also has the support of 1 independent and 1 HLP MLA.\n\nThe INDIA Alliance or the Congres Alliance has a total of 34 MLAs with it, with 30 MLAs of Congress and 4 independents supporting the party.\n\nHowever, in the opposition, Dushyant Chautala's JJP has 10 MLAs, and Abhay Chautala's INLD has 1. One independent MLA is not supporting any coalition.\n\nHaryana's political equations are not as easy as they seem. Earlier, when Nayab Singh Saini was throned the top post, a few JJP MLAs supported the government when it faced the no-confidence motion. Many political analysts believe that the BJP government can muster the support of as many as five MLAs if it is to face a similar no-confidence motion again.\n\nNotably, for the next four months, no further such motion can be placed inside the assembly. From a constitutional perspective, a no-confidence motion against the government cannot be brought against Deputy Singh Saini for the next six months after February 22.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udai_Bhan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Udai Bhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislative_assemblies_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State legislative assemblies of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepender_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepender Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranjit Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhay_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhay Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/05/07/article/image/Haryana Assembly numbers (1)-1715098808097.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-22", "textStart": 3492, "textEnd": 3503}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Earlier, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala wrote to Dattatreya saying that the Nayab Singh Saini government no longer commanded a majority and sought an immediate floor test. Since the Saini government secured its trust vote in March, and no vote of no-confidence motion can be brought in for six months.\n\nFormer chief minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been demanding the imposition of President's Rule in the state as, according to him, the Saini government had lost its majority. This claim was strongly denied by both Mr Saini and the BJP.\n\nHooda said the Congress has 30 MLAs, but in a reference to some JJP MLAs indicating their support in recent days to the BJP, he raised doubts whether all 10 JJP MLAs were supporting with their party. \"We are 30 MLAs... regarding the JJP, it would have been better had they paraded 10 MLAs before the Governor. There is no dispute about our MLAs. Some of their (JJP) MLAs are supporting someone else... let them go to the governor with their 10 MLAs,\" he said.\n\nAfter withdrawal of support by the three Independents, Hooda said the Saini government was in a minority. \"On moral grounds, it should resign. President's Rule should be imposed... we are demanding fresh elections in the state,\" he said.\n\nJJP leader Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said that the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the \"minority\" BJP government. Reacting to this, Hooda had said Wednesday: \"They should write to the Governor (that the government is in a minority)\".\n\nInsiders say that three MLAs belonging to the Dushyant Chautala-led JJP met former chief minister and BJP leader Manohar Lal Khattar in Panipat. Speaking to the media in Sirsa, Khattar said: \"The Opposition is doing vague calculations. During the floor test, if they can retain even 23 of their MLAs, it will be a big deal... I don't see any no-confidence motion being moved anytime soon, but if any such situation arises, we will have a floor test... Many JJP MLAs have given support to the BJP. This is what I'm saying, they need to think beyond what meets the eye...\"\n\nInsiders claim that any forward movement in Haryana will only take place after the results of the Lok Sabha elections are out on June 4.\n\nThe 90-member Haryana Assembly at present has an effective strength of 88, with Karnal and Rania Assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. The INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party have one member each.

The opposition argues that the government should resign on moral grounds and demands fresh elections.\n\nThe Congress, the JJP and the INLD have approached Governor Bandaru Dattatreya, stepping up their efforts to topple the Haryana's BJP government after it was reduced to a minority in the state assembly.\n\nIn separate letters to the Governor, the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) have sought a floor test in the assembly.\n\nThe Haryana Congress on Thursday sent a letter to the Governor's office seeking time on Friday to meet him and present a memorandum on the present political situation in the state.\n\nOn Wednesday, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala wrote to the governor, saying the Saini government no longer commands a majority and there should be an immediate floor test.\n\nINLD's Abhay Singh Chautala also wrote to the Governor on Thursday, stating that ''in view of the fact that the BJP government has lost its majority, the party demands that the government should be immediately asked to convene the Vidhan Sabha to hold a floor test to prove that it still enjoys its confidence''.\n\nEven as the opposition parties stepped up their efforts, three JJP MLAs are learnt to have met BJP leader and former Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Panipat.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Bhiwani, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the Congress has 30 MLAs but raised doubts whether all 10 JJP MLAs were onboard with their party, in a reference to some JJP MLAs indicating their support in recent days to the BJP. Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini maintained that his government is not in trouble.\n\nHe said on Thursday that his government won a confidence vote in March and if it comes to seeking the trust vote, ''I will do it again when the time comes''.\n\n''You ask Dushaynt Chautala how many MLAs he has got,'' Saini told reporters in Karnal, challenging the claim that his government has lost the majority in the House.\n\nHitting out at Dushyant Chautala, Saini said the former deputy chief minister has lost people's trust. ''In the Lok Sabha polls, people will know the candidates he has put up where they stand,'' the CM said.\n\nSaini's predecessor Khattar claimed that many MLAs are in touch with the BJP and there is ''nothing to worry about''.\n\n''Their arithmetic is not like they are thinking,'' said Khattar referring to opposition claiming that government is in a minority.\n\nSenior BJP leader Om Prakash Dhankar also said the state government is stable and there is no danger to it.\n\nThree Independent MLAs on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government and announced they would back the Congress. The government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member state assembly.\n\nHowever, the House at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member each, while the total number of Independent MLAs are six.\n\nIn its letter, the Congress said that a party delegation led by Deputy CLP leader Aftab Ahmed and B B Batra, chief whip CLP, wants to meet the governor on May 10.\n\nOn Thursday, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the ''minority'' dispensation should resign on moral grounds.\n\n''We have also sought time from the governor,'' Hooda said when asked to comment by reporters on the JJP writing a letter to the governor.\n\nHooda was campaigning in Bhiwani for party's Lok Sabha candidate Rao Dan Singh.\n\n''We are 30 MLAs...regarding JJP, it would have been better had they paraded 10 MLAs before the governor.\n\n''There is no dispute about our MLAs. Some of their (JJP's) MLAs are supporting someone else...let them go to the governor with their 10 MLAs,'' Hooda said.\n\nAfter withdrawal of support by the three Independents, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority.\n\n''On moral grounds, it should resign. President's rule should be imposed...we are demanding fresh elections in the state,'' the former chief minister said.\n\nIn his letter to the Governor, INLD's Abhay Chautala said, ''In the present case, Nayab Singh Saini government has clearly lost its majority and has no legal or moral right to remain in office.'' Abhay Chautala said that in case the Governor finds that in the present circumstances it is not possible to convene the assembly for the floor test then he may ''recommend President's rule'' in the state.\n\nTaking on both the BJP and the JJP whose alliance ended after Saini replaced Khattar as Chief Minister in March, Hooda said, ''They entered into an agreement to break the alliance. People understand this. People know there is a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP (in the Lok Sabha polls), others are 'vote kaatu' (vote-cutting) parties.'' JJP leader Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said that the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the ''minority'' BJP government.\n\nChautala had also said that if Hooda takes steps to topple the Saini government, his party would support the move.\n\nHowever, the BJP government appears safe for now. Under the rules, a no-trust motion against a government can't be moved within six months of the previous one. In this case, the BJP government in Haryana had faced the no-confidence motion in February.\n\nLater, after Nayab Saini took oath as chief minister, his government won the trust vote on March 13.\n\nThe assembly elections are due in Haryana in October this year.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

The independent MLAs joining Congress today show how the BJP has weakened...According to the current scenario, if steps are taken to corner the government during the elections, we will think about giving them (Congress) support from outside. Now, Congress will have to decide if they are going to take any step to corner the current BJP Govt or not...,\" Dushyant Chautala told ANI.\n\nEarlier on May 7, the Haryana government suffered a jolt when three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government pushing the government into a minority. The three MLAs are Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri. All of them decided to extend support to Congress.\n\nHowever, the BJP appears confident of retaining power with former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP.\n\nThe development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nIn the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP which had 41 MLAs initially was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.\n\nEarlier six out of seven Independent MLAs used to support the BJP. With three Independents withdrawing their support, the BJP at present, has the support of three Independents and one HLP MLA, making it a government of 43 MLAs.\n\nThe 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state go to the polls on May 25.

In such a scenario, the governor extends an invitation to the leader of the single-largest party -- currently the BJP -- to initiate a government for 10 days. During this period, the party is granted the opportunity to secure support from other parties. Should the party fail to garner sufficient support within the timeframe, the governor dissolves the government -- paving the way for a fresh election in the state.\n\nIn the 2019 assembly polls, the BJP had emerged as the single-largest party and formed an alliance with Dushyant Singh Chautala's Jannnayak Janata Party, which has 10 MLAs. Two months ago, the BJP snapped ties with the JJP. While the total strength of the House is 90, right now it is 88 as two MLAs resigned earlier to contest the general elections -- both on BJP tickets. This has brought the majority mark to 45.\n\nThe BJP has 40 of its own MLAs and has claimed support of four JJP MLAs, taking its tally to 44. Meanwhile, the Congress has 30 MLAs in the House and the support of the three Independents takes its total to 33 seats. No single party seems to have a majority in Haryana. Separately, assembly elections are scheduled in the state in October.\n\nThe three Independent MLAs who switched sides Tuesday -- Dharampal Gondher (Nilokheri), Randhir Golan (Pundri), and Sombir Sangwan (Dadri) -- announced their decision in the presence of former CM, the Congress's Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Rohtak. Soon after, Hooda said, \"This government should resign keeping in view the sentiments of the public. President's rule should be imposed in the state.\" Haryana Congress president Udai Bhan demanded that the assembly elections in the state be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls on May 25.\n\nIn response, CM Nayab Singh Saini accused the Congress of engineering the switch in support. According to the Indian Express, he said, \"Some MLAs have some ambitions. These days, the Congress is apparently fulfilling desires...People understand this...They also know who has what ambitions. The Congress has nothing to do with the needs of the people.\" To recall, Khattar resigned from the post of CM in March, paving the way for party colleague and state unit chief Saini to succeed him.\n\nMeanwhile, JJP leader Chautala on Wednesday said that his party will post vote against the BJP in case of a no-confidence motion. Notably, Chautala was deputy chief minister to BJP's Manohar Lal Khattar in the alliance government. Chautala also announced his support if the Congress wanted to \"bring down this government.\" \"The LoP must topple the government...We have whip; all our MLAs are bound to it. They will follow the party's decision,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udai_Bhan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Udai Bhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilokheri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nilokheri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nilokheri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l15920240312120502.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2312, "textEnd": 2318}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Hence, the majority mark is 45 and both the BJP and Congress have the support of 43 MLAs. Two independent MLAs have so far been equidistance from both the BJP and the Congress.\n\nVoting for two assembly by-polls along with that of Lok Sabha constituencies will take place on May 25 in the state.\n\nThe Congress not having a clear majority may be a reason why the party is not staking claim to form the government. A senior Congress leader said they were also apprehensive about whether all 10 JJP MLAs would support the Congress or not. The fear is that if the floor test is carried out, some JJP MLAs may support the BJP against the party whip. Moreover, the Congress is apprehensive that some of its MLAs may also switch sides and join the BJP.\n\nThe Congress is also not in a position to move a no-confidence motion as Haryana assembly rules do not allow two trust motions within six months.\n\nOn March 13, Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda had moved a no-confidence motion against Saini, who had the support of 48 MLAs. At the time, the BJP had 41 MLAs, and received support from six independent MLAs and one from the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP), to register 47 votes. The 10 JJP MLAs had abstained from the voting, helping the BJP to win the trust vote easily.\n\nIn the present situation, the BJP has claimed that apart from 43, it has the support of three JJP MLAs whose names it did not disclose. The JJP had issued notices to three MLAs for \"anti-party\" activities when they spoke against party leader and former deputy chief minister, Dushyant Chautala. These three MLAs have so far not revealed their stand. Khattar, in fact, told reporters on Tuesday that they were confident of proving the majority if the governor asked them to do so as they have the support of MLAs from other parties.\n\nHooda admitted to reporters on Wednesday that it cannot bring a trust vote against Saini because of the rules and asked Saini to prove his majority on the floor of the house on \"moral\" grounds. On Thursday, the party wrote to the governor asking for an appointment to discuss the prevailing \"political crisis\" in the state. The JJP also asked the governor to call a state assembly session to conduct the trust vote saying that Saini has lost the majority.\n\nUnlike any previous instance of the opposition moving in fast gear to topple the incumbent government, the Congress and the JJP have been slow, possibly because the two parties are wary of each other.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, three independent MLAs also extended support to the Congress. The Congress, however, did not write to the governor seeking a trust vote immediately.\n\nThe Congress and the JJP seem to be waiting for the other to take the initiative and are not willing to break the status quo unilaterally by going to the governor.\n\nOn Wednesday, for example, Hooda asked Chautala to take the initiative to parade his 10 MLAs before the governor and seek a trust vote. \"After he takes his MLAs to the governor's house, I will send ours to Raj Bhawan led by MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra,\" Hooda said. And, on Thursday, Chautala asked Hooda to join him in parading the MLAs before the governor. Hooda did not respond.\n\nIn the absence of either party ready to make a show of strength, the governor may not be inclined to call the chief minister to prove his majority.\n\nEven if the Congress and JJP MLAs are paraded before the governor, there is no surety over Dattatreya asking Saini to prove his majority within a certain timeframe. The Governor, who is the ceremonial head of the legislative, is not bound by rules to decide within a certain timeframe on the claims of the ruling party having lost its majority.\n\nThe Supreme Court in separate rulings has said that the governor can take \"reasonable\" time to decide on such issues without defining the reasonable time.\n\nFrom the sequence of events since Tuesday, it appears that Congress may not be much interested in the Saini government falling before the Lok Sabha polls on May 25. The BJP holds all 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana and the Congress is aiming to wrest at least half of these seats from the ruling party. Congress leaders aware of the development said that the party does not want to get involved in government formation during the Lok Sabha campaign period but wants to extract as much political mileage as possible from the current uncertainty.\n\nSo far, Hooda has demanded President's Rule in the state but refrained from staking claim to form the government.\n\n\"We know forming a government with 30 MLAs for less than six months would be a risky affair. We cannot trust the JJP which was part of the BJP government for four-and-half years,\" said a senior Congress leader who asked not to be named.\n\nThe state assembly elections in Haryana are slated for December 2024. The Congress believes that the MLAs leaving the BJP camp would help the party in the assembly polls. And, for that to happen, the party is willing to wait.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/Congress-candidate-Deepender-Singh-Hooda-was-accom_1715276884995_1715276899881.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 1026, "textEnd": 1032, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 1648, "textEnd": 1656}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member state assembly.\n\nHowever, the House at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member each, while the total number of Independent MLAs are six.\n\nIn its letter, the Congress said that a party delegation led by Deputy CLP leader Aftab Ahmed and B B Batra, chief whip CLP, wants to meet the governor on May 10.\n\nOn Thursday, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the \"minority\" dispensation should resign on moral grounds.\n\n\"We have also sought time from the governor,\" Hooda said when asked to comment by reporters on the JJP writing a letter to the governor.\n\nHooda was campaigning in Bhiwani for party's Lok Sabha candidate Rao Dan Singh.\n\n\"We are 30 MLAs...regarding JJP, it would have been better had they paraded 10 MLAs before the governor.\n\n\"There is no dispute about our MLAs. Some of their (JJP's) MLAs are supporting someone else...let them go to the governor with their 10 MLAs,\" Hooda said.\n\nAfter withdrawal of support by the three Independents, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority.\n\n\"On moral grounds, it should resign. President's rule should be imposed...we are demanding fresh elections in the state,\" the former chief minister said.\n\nIn his letter to the Governor, INLD's Abhay Chautala said, \"In the present case, Nayab Singh Saini government has clearly lost its majority and has no legal or moral right to remain in office.\" Abhay Chautala said that in case the Governor finds that in the present circumstances it is not possible to convene the assembly for the floor test then he may \"recommend President's rule\" in the state.\n\nTaking on both the BJP and the JJP whose alliance ended after Saini replaced Khattar as Chief Minister in March, Hooda said, \"They entered into an agreement to break the alliance. People understand this. People know there is a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP (in the Lok Sabha polls), others are 'vote kaatu' (vote-cutting) parties.\" JJP leader Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said that the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the \"minority\" BJP government.\n\nChautala had also said that if Hooda takes steps to topple the Saini government, his party would support the move.\n\nHowever, the BJP government appears safe for now. Under the rules, a no-trust motion against a government can't be moved within six months of the previous one. In this case, the BJP government in Haryana had faced the no-confidence motion in February.\n\nLater, after Nayab Saini took oath as chief minister, his government won the trust vote on March 13.\n\nThe assembly elections are due in Haryana in October this year.

He said that his government is not in trouble and is working strongly. MLAs Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Singh Gollen, and Dharampal Gonder announced their decision to support Congress in a press conference. Here are key developments:\n\n1. CM Saini was campaigning for the BJP's Sirsa Lok Sabha candidate, Ashok Tanwar, when he spoke to the reporters in Sirsa. He said, \" When the Congress government had difficulties in the Lok Sabha, they started fulfilling the requests of specific groups. The BJP government is operating at maximum capacity. The wishes of Congress will not be fulfilled by the people. The people of Congress believe in corruption, but the BJP and PM Modi support development.\"\n\n2. The government, which has the support of two other MLAs, is now falling short of the majority by two seats. In the 90-member Haryana Assembly, the BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress has 30, and the JJP holds 10 MLAs in the house.\n\n3. Dushyant Chautala, leader of the JJP, announced on Wednesday that his party would oppose their ex-ally, the BJPin a no-confidence motion. The JJP was in coalition with the BJP in October of 2019 but parted ways in March of this year.\n\n4. The Congress State Chief, Udan Bhai, said that the BJP earlier had the support of the JJP and independents, but now the JJP has withdrew the backing and the independents are also leaving. Speaking at a press conference, Udan Bhai said, \"The three Independent MLAs have extended their support to the Congress party.\"\n\nHe added that the Saini government is currently a minority one. The Congress leader stated that Saini had no right to remain, not even for a minute, and that he should submit his resignation.\n\n5. After Manohar Lal Khattar resigned as Chief Minister in the state, Saini won a vote of confidence through voice voting on March 13 in the Haryana assembly. But despite this, the Saini-led BJP government's grip on power has recently been challenged by defections within its coalition.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirsa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sirsa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sirsa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashok_Tanwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashok Tanwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/08/1402225-solar-2024-05-08t134528.852.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 2016, "textEnd": 2024}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Congress is now racing against time to make the most of the situation and cobble together the numbers required to topple the Nayab Singh Saini government months before state polls.\n\nBehind the crisis is the decision of three Independent MLAs to switch from the BJP camp to the Congress side last evening. MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) announced their decision to withdraw support to the BJP government at a press meet in Rohtak yesterday. They were accompanied by Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Congress's Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and state Congress chief Udai Bhan.\n\nAddressing the media, Mr Hooda said, \"The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government.\"\n\nChief Minister Saini, who took over the top post just about two months back, had a guarded response. \"When I heard about it, I knew that moment the Congress is trying to fulfil their wishes. Everyone has a wish. But the people know. They know the Congress has got nothing to do with the wishes of people, but is only focused on fulfilling their wishes,\" he said. The Chief Minister did not elaborate on how the BJP plans to counter the threat to its government.\n\nIn a significant remark, Haryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta has said a majority test had earlier been conducted on the demand of Mr Hooda and there is no need to conduct another for six months. The Nayab Singh Saini government cleared a trust vote soon after he took over in March.\n\nThe JJP Factor\n\nAdding a twist to the Haryana political upheaval, the BJP's former ally Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) has offered support to the Congress. JJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala has said the government has lost the trust of the people. \"We will support a move to bring down the government. The Congress has to decide if it will make a move or not,\" he said. This comes less than two months after the BJP parted ways with JJP, which has 10 MLAs, and cobbled together enough numbers to cross the majority mark.\n\nHow The Numbers Stack Up\n\nThe 90-seat Haryana Assembly currently has 88 members. This means the majority mark is 45. The BJP has 40 MLAs of its own and is supported by three out of 6 Independent MLAs. This makes it 43, two short of the magic figure. The Congress has 30 legislators and three Independents now support it. If the JJP backs it, the Congress will have the support of 43 MLAs. This leaves two MLAs -- one from Haryana Lokhit Party and the other from INLD.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe Chautala Family Factor\n\nAn interesting subplot playing out amid the Haryana government crisis is linked to the Chautala clan that once dominated the state's political landscape before a string of poll setbacks, convictions and a split reduced INLD to a one-man party in the Assembly. Currently, INLD general secretary Abhay Chautala is the party's lone MLA in the Assembly. Now that the JJP, led by Mr Chautala's estranged nephew Dushyant Chautala has offered support to the Congress, the question is will Abhay Chautala remain on the same side or join ranks with BJP.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saikat_kumar_bose@ndtv.com", "name": "Saikat Kumar Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "gurpreet_singh_chhina@ndtv.com", "name": "Gurpreet Singh Chhina", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udai_Bhan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Udai Bhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Chand_Gupta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gian Chand Gupta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhay_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhay Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/kilkm28_bhupinder-hooda-nayab-singh-saini-split_625x300_08_May_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738?ver-20240506.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

They withdrew their support from the BJP.

The three legislators announced their support while addressing the media in the presence of Leader of Opposition in Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state unit Congress president Chaudhary Udaibhan.\n\nThe three MLAs have sent letters withdrawing their support from the government to the Governor. The legislators submitted that the public was tried of the BJP, and now there was no justification in giving opportunity to the BJP because every section is unhappy with unemployment, inflation, increasing crime, family identity and property identities in the government.

The MLAs stated that now the public's expectations are only from the Congress.\n\nThree Independent MLAs in Haryana Extend Support to Congress:\n\nBhupinder Hooda, meanwhile, expressed his gratitude to the three legislators for their support and said they had taken this decision, keeping in mind public sentiments. \"Their right decision, taken at the right time, will definitely bear fruit. The Congress' victory is certain in the Lok Sabha and upcoming Assembly elections,\" he said.\n\n\"BJP leaders and workers themselves are fed up with this government. This is the reason why many people are leaving the BJP and joining the Congress. Till now, more than 100 big leaders, including MLAs, former MLAs, MPs and former MPs, have joined the Congress from other parties in the last one and a half years,\" Hooda added.\n\nFollowing the resignations of Independent MLA Ranjit Chautala and former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar from the 90-member Haryana Assembly, the BJP now has only 40 MLAs out of 88. After the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) with 10 legislators withdrew their support in March, the BJP enjoyed the support of five Independent MLAs and the Haryana Lokhit Party legislator Gopal Kanda.\n\nNow, three Independent MLAs have extended support to the Congress. Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini secured the trust vote after assuming the role of Chief Minister in March. He will also be contesting the Karnal Assembly by-election on May 25.

Three Independent MLAs, who were with them, also withdrew support and conveyed the same to the Governor. The JJP has clearly stated that in the event of a No Confidence Motion against this government, we will support it. We have also written to the Governor, clearing our stand. Now, the onus is on the Congress to take this step (seek a floor test). They have to decide if they would do what's necessary to corner and bring down this government.\"\n\nOn May 7, the Haryana government suffered a big jolt after three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government, pushing the dispensation into a minority. The three MLAs were Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri.

They withdrew their support from the BJP.\n\nResponding to the development, senior Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the BJP government has lost majority after the withdrawal of support from the JJP and three Independents.\n\n\"The Assembly elections should be conducted immediately by imposing President's Rule in Haryana, because today not only just the public but also the people who voted and supported the BJP are unhappy with the policies of the government,\" he told the media here.\n\nThe three legislators announced their support while addressing the media in the presence of Leader of Opposition in Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state unit Congress president Chaudhary Udaibhan.\n\nThe three MLAs have sent letters withdrawing their support from the government to the Governor.\n\nThe legislators submitted that the public was tried of the BJP, and now there was no justification in giving opportunity to the BJP because every section is unhappy with unemployment, inflation, increasing crime, family identity and property identities in the government.\n\nThey jointly said every class, including farmers, labourers, employees and traders are agitating today.\n\nThe Independent MLAs added they tried to warn the BJP on different occasions while they were in the government but the BJP did not give up its stubbornness. The MLAs stated that now the public's expectations are only from the Congress.\n\nBhupinder Hooda, meanwhile, expressed his gratitude to the three legislators for their support and said they had taken this decision, keeping in mind public sentiments.\n\n\"Their right decision, taken at the right time, will definitely bear fruit. The Congress' victory is certain in the Lok Sabha and upcoming Assembly elections,\" he said.\n\n\"BJP leaders and workers themselves are fed up with this government. This is the reason why many people are leaving the BJP and joining the Congress. Till now, more than 100 big leaders, including MLAs, former MLAs, MPs and former MPs, have joined the Congress from other parties in the last one and a half years,\" Hooda added.\n\nFollowing the resignations of Independent MLA Ranjit Chautala and former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar from the 90-member Haryana Assembly, the BJP now has only 40 MLAs out of 88.\n\nAfter the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) with 10 legislators withdrew their support in March, the BJP enjoyed the support of five Independent MLAs and the Haryana Lokhit Party legislator Gopal Kanda.\n\nNow, three Independent MLAs have extended support to the Congress.\n\nChief Minister Nayab Singh Saini secured the trust vote after assuming the role of Chief Minister in March.

Everyone has a wish. But the people know. They know the Congress has got nothing to do with the wishes of people, but only with fulfilling their personal wishes,\" Saini said. According to NDTV, Saini downplayed the situation as not alarming.\n\nThree Independent MLAs, Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri), on Tuesday, withdrew support to the government and announced they would back the Congress, reducing the Nayab Singh Saini government to a minority in the state assembly.\n\nThe opposition leader, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, expressed his gratitude to the three MLAs for their support and said they have taken this decision while keeping public sentiments in mind. The leader of the opposition said there is a wave in favour of Congress in the country, including Haryana, and that the Independent MLAs have made this decision with respect to the sentiments of the people. He claimed people had made up their minds to form the Congress government in the state. The government, now backed by only two other Independents, falls short of the majority mark in the 88-member House.\n\nSome Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs have recently indicated support for the BJP, though the JJP pulled out of the coalition government in March. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House.\n\nJJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said Hooda should initiate the process to \"bring down the government which has lost trust of people\". He also said Hooda should immediately meet the governor and apprise him of the situation. The Congress said in a statement that the three MLAs had already sent letters to the governor saying they had withdrawn their support from the government.\n\nTalking to PTI over the phone, Chautala said, \"Hooda says the government is in a minority. He is the Leader of Opposition and should immediately meet the governor and apprise him of the developments.\"\n\nWhen asked whether JJP will extend support to the Congress, Chautala said, \"I am not saying JJP is willing to support and form a government with the Congress. At least the government that has lost trust of people, Hooda should initiate the process to bring it down.\"\n\nHe also said that in addition to meeting the governor, Hooda should also open a channel of communication with the JJP.\n\nMeanwhile, Haryana AAP president Sushil Gupta, who is contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Kurukshetra with Congress' support, also said the BJP government is in the minority. \"I request the governor that this government should be dismissed immediately,\" he said, adding that Chief Minister Saini has no right to continue and should step down.\n\n(With PTI Inputs)", "source": {"uri": "onmanorama.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OnManorama"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_families_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political families of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurukshetra", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurukshetra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kurukshetra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/kerala/top-news/images/2024/3/11/nayab-saini.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The developments come ahead of the Lok Sabha polls to all 10 seats in the state on May 25, with Assembly elections to follow towards the end of the year. The BJP insists its government led by Chief Minister Nayab Saini is intact.\n\nThe Congress led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda moved a no-confidence motion against the Saini government as recently as March 13. CM Saini won it with a voice vote.\n\nWith the JJP's 10 MLAs having parted ways, the BJP had 41 MLAs at the time, along with six Independent MLAs and one MLA of the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) backing it, putting its numbers at 48 in a House of 90. The Congress had 30 MLAs, the INLD one, while one Independent, Balraj Kundu, who has remained non-committal all through the ups and downs in Haryana, abstained. After the JJP issued a whip, none of its MLAs voted, helping the BJP easily win.\n\nAs per rules, a no-confidence motion cannot be moved within six months of a previous one. Asked about this, Hooda agreed that the motion could not be moved at this point, but asserted that \"the Chief Minister should resign on moral grounds, as his government has lost majority\".\n\nThe situation in March versus now\n\nToday, the strength of the House is 88, after Manohar Lal Khattar and Ranjit Singh resigned from their respective Assembly segments of Karnal and Rania to become the BJP's Lok Sabha candidates from Karnal and Hisar, respectively.\n\nAt current strength, the BJP needs 45 votes for a majority. With Khattar's resignation, it has 40 MLAs, plus the support of two Independents and the HLP MLA, taking its total to 43. The BJP has also claimed the support of three of the JJP's 10 MLAs, who have distanced themselves from Dushyant Chautala and been served notice for \"anti-party activities\". Counting the three, the BJP government has the support of 46 MLAs, just 1 more than a simple majority. Even if they get disqualified for defection, the House strength will come down to 85, and the majority mark to 43. The BJP has 43 as of now.\n\nBut the Congress has claimed that several other MLAs are in touch with it. As has the BJP.\n\nCan the Opposition stake claim?\n\nIt will first have to seek an appointment with the Governor to stake claim to form the government. The Congress, given it is the largest Opposition party, has to do it but is yet to initiate such a move. On Wednesday, while offering his support to the Congress should it make such a move, Dushyant said, \"It's up to Leader of the Opposition Hooda to make the move to topple the government.\"\n\nHooda told The Indian Express that Dushyant too could take the initiative. \"He is saying these things after staying in the BJP-led government for four-and-a-half years. If he isn't the BJP's B-Team, he should meet the Governor and parade his 10 MLAs, and then I shall send ours to the Raj Bhavan, led by MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra.\"\n\nEven if both the Congress and JJP meet the Governor and parade their respective MLAs to stake a claim, there is no guarantee regarding what the Governor will do. Even if the Governor directs the state government to prove its majority within a specific time period, the possibility that some JJP MLAs would either defect or abstain from voting remains high. In other words, the BJP may again be able to prove its majority.\n\nPlus, the Congress's whole focus now is the Lok Sabha polls, due on May 25. The BJP currently holds all 10 seats, and is campaigning intensely to retain them.\n\nThe Haryana Assembly elections are not so far away either, scheduled for October. There is a possibility that once the Lok Sabha polls are over, the Opposition may press the issue again to mount pressure on the BJP ahead of the Vidhan Sabha polls.\n\nHow is the BJP looking at the scenario?\n\nHaryana BJP leaders are confident their government is \"intact\", and that if the need arises, \"other MLAs will support us\". Khattar told mediapersons, \"The Congress and JJP shouldn't worry about us. Instead, they should first set their own houses in order. There is no threat to our government. It will continue to serve the people. We shall win an absolute majority in the next Assembly elections, so that such a situation never arises again.\"\n\nVidhan Sabha Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said, \"Officially, I have not received any intimation from any MLA. It is only in the media that there are reports that three Independent MLAs have decided to support the Congress. Usually, when a no-confidence motion is moved, the next one can only be moved after six months, although the Governor, as a constitutional authority, can take any decision as and when the need arises. If he gives us any directions, we will follow those.\"\n\nFormer home minister Anil Vij, who has been angry with the BJP since it replaced Khattar with Saini and he did not find place in the government, said, \"I'm saddened that the Independent MLAs have withdrawn their support today, but Hooda Sahib's wish will never be fulfilled, as we have many arrows in our quiver.\"\n\nBut why is it still damaging for BJP?\n\nEven if the BJP government survives, the fact that MLAs are leaving it for the Opposition may strengthen the public perception that the pendulum is swinging towards the Congress.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "varinder_bhatia@indianexpress.com", "name": "Varinder Bhatia", "type":

Three Independent MLAs, who were with them, also withdrew support and conveyed the same to the Governor. The JJP has clearly stated that in the event of a No Confidence Motion against this government, we will support it. We have also written to the Governor, clearing our stand. Now, the onus is on the Congress to take this step (seek a floor test). They have to decide if they would do what's necessary to corner and bring down this government.\"\n\nOn May 7, the Haryana government suffered a big jolt after three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government, pushing the dispensation into a minority. The three MLAs were Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri. All of them decided to extend support to the Congress.\n\nHowever, the BJP appeared confident of retaining power, with former chief minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that several leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with his party.\n\nThe development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months after Nayab Saini took over as CM, replacing Khattar.\n\nIn the House of 90 members, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP, which had 41 MLAs initially, were reduced to 39 after the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.\n\nSix of the seven Independent MLAs support the incumbent BJP earlier. However, with three Independents withdrawing support, the BJP, at present, has the support of only three Independents and one HLP MLA, taking its strength in the Assembly to 43 MLAs.\n\nAll 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state would go to the polls in the penultimate phase, on May 25.

He further added that if a floor test were conducted today, JJP MLAs would vote to overthrow the government.\n\nThree independent candidates, who earlier sided with the BJP, have now withdrawn their support and extended it to the Congress. According to reports, former CM Hooda and Congress state chief Uday Bhan have informed that MLA Sombir Sangwan from Dadri, MLA Dharampal Gondar from Nilokheri, and Randhir Golan from Pundri have declared support to the Congress.\n\nIn terms of the number strength in the assembly, the government was reduced to the minority. However, it does not mean that the government will collapse. At present there is no threat to the government in Haryana. Saini took oath as chief minister on March 12 this year after the floor test in the assembly. According to the rule, there must be a gap of 6 months between two floor tests. In such a situation, the Opposition cannot bring a no-confidence motion till September 2024 and assembly elections are to be held in Haryana in October-November this year. This means the BJP government in the state is safe.\n\nAlso Read: Haryana: Is CM Nayab Singh Saini in trouble? Can Hooda-led Congress topple BJP govt?

The Haryana Congress on Thursday sent a letter to the governor's office seeking time on Friday to meet him and present a memorandum on the present political situation in the state.\n\nIn a separate letter on Wednesday, Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala wrote to the governor, saying the Saini government no longer commands a majority and there should be an immediate floor test.\n\nThree Independent MLAs on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government and announced they would back the Congress. The government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member state assembly.\n\nHowever, the House at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member each, while the total number of Independent MLAs are six.\n\nIn its letter, the Congress said that a party delegation led by Deputy CLP leader Aftab Ahmed and B B Batra, chief whip CLP, wants to meet the governor on May 10.\n\nChief Minister Saini again asserted that his government was not in trouble.\n\nOn Thursday, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the \"minority\" dispensation should resign on moral grounds.\n\n\"We have also sought time from the governor,\" Hooda said when asked to comment on the JJP writing a letter to the governor.\n\nHooda was campaigning in Bhiwani for party's Lok Sabha candidate Rao Dan Singh.\n\nReplying to another question, Hooda raised doubts whether all 10 JJP MLAs were onboard with their party, in a reference to some JJP MLAs indicating their support in recent days to the BJP.\n\n\"We are 30 MLAs...regarding JJP, it would have been better had they paraded 10 MLAs before the governor.\n\n\"There is no dispute about our MLAs. Some of their (JJP's) MLAs are supporting someone else...let them go to the governor with their 10 MLAs,\" he said.\n\nAfter withdrawal of support by the three Independents, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority.\n\n\"On moral grounds, it should resign. President's rule should be imposed...we are demanding fresh elections in the state,\" the former chief minister said.\n\nTaking on both the BJP and the JJP whose alliance ended after Saini replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as Chief Minister in March, Hooda said, \"They entered into agreement to break the alliance. People understand this.\" People know there is a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP (in the Lok Sabha polls), others are \"vote kaatu\" (vote-cutting) parties.\n\nJJP leader Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said that the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the \"minority\" BJP government.\n\nChautala also said that if Hooda takes steps to bring down the Saini government, his party would support the move.\n\nHowever, the BJP government appears safe for now. According to prevailing norms, a no-trust motion against a government can't be moved within six months of the previous one. In this case, the BJP government in Haryana had faced the no-confidence motion in February.\n\nThe assembly elections are due in Haryana in October this year.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao_Dan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rao Dan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaudhary_Aftab_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chaudhary Aftab Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhiwani_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhiwani district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/May/1715092643_nayab.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1494, "textEnd": 1500}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Mr. Chautala's move comes as there's chaos in the political scene due to three independent MLAs withdrawing their support and increasing tensions within the ruling BJP coalition.\n\nIn a letter to the Governor of Haryana, Bandaru Dattatreya, Mr Chautala mentioned that recent resignations and withdrawals of support had put the ruling BJP alliance in a risky position of possibly becoming a minority.\n\nMr Chautala wrote to the Governor. \"I request you to instruct the appropriate authority to immediately organize a floor test to confirm the government's majority,\"\n\nThe demand for a floor test follows the recent decision of three Independent MLAs to switch their allegiance from the BJP faction to the Congress faction. On Tuesday, MLAs Sombir Sangwan (representing Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (from Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (of Nilokheri) announced their withdrawal of support for the BJP government during a press conference in Rohtak. They were accompanied by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, and Udai Bhan, the state Congress chief.\n\nMr Chautala, Leader of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and a former BJP ally, clearly stated his party's readiness to support an alternative government, hinting at a potential alliance with the Congress.\n\nMr Chautala stated, \"The government formed two months ago is now in the minority because one MLA from the BJP and an Independent MLA who supported them have resigned -- additionally, three independent MLAs who were backing them withdrawn their support and wrote to the Governor. JJP has clarified that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this government, we will support it,\".\n\n\"We have informed the Governor about this. Now, it's up to the Congress to take action (by seeking a Floor Test). The Governor has the authority to order a Floor Test to determine the government's strength, and if it lacks the majority, immediate implementation of President's Rule in the state,\" he added.\n\nThe Haryana Assembly, with 90 seats, currently has 88 members, with the majority mark at 45. The BJP has 40 MLAs, backed by three out of six independent candidates, falling short of the majority by two MLAs. The Congress has 30 MLAs, supported by three independent candidates. If the JJP supports the Congress, their total would reach 43 MLAs.

They were among 48 legislators who had supported the Saini-led BJP govt in a trust vote in the assembly on March 12. However, there is no immediate threat to the Saini led govt in Haryana even as it has effectively become a minority govt.\n\nThe BJP, however, claimed that its government was safe in Haryana. \"The government is totally safe and stable from all points,\" state parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar said.\n\nCM Nayab Singh Saini also was confident that his govt would not be affected. \"I have come to know that few independent MLAs who had 'some desires' announced support to Congress party. Public understands the intentions of such persons and it would not have any impact on our government,\" Saini said.\n\nThe 90-member Haryana assembly has an effective strength of 88 at present after the resignations of former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala. The BJP right now has 40 MLAs, Congress has 30 MLAs, JJP 10, INLD and HLP (Gopal Kanda) one each and there are six independents. In the current scenario, BJP requires 45 legislators for majority in the 88-member House.\n\nAs BJP has 40 seats, it would require five more legislators for support. It still has support of two independent legislators - Nayan Pal Rawat (Prithla) and Rakesh Daulatabad (Badshahpur) - and HLP legislator Gopal Kanda, taking the BJP count to 43 right now.\n\nTwo JJP MLAs Ramniwas Surjakhera from Narwana (reserved) constituency and Jogi Ram Sihag (Barwala) - recently announced their support for the BJP candidates in the Lok Sabha polls against the party line.\n\nNo danger to Saini govt in case of no-trust motion: Experts\n\nSeveral MLAs of Dushyant Chautala-led JJP have been expressing displeasure against their party leadership and are not supporting their party's candidates in the Lok Sabha polls and this might work in favour of BJP at the time of any floor test. Interestingly in March, Dushyant had issued a whip asking his 10 MLAs to remain absent from the assembly session on trust vote, allowing the BJP to easily sail through the floor test with its own 41 MLAs.\n\nAccording to legal and legislative experts, even if a few MLAs remain absent from assembly proceedings on a no-trust motion, Saini would be able to survive and continue leading the BJP govt.\n\nAccording to Ram Narain Yadav, retired additional secretary of Haryana Vidhan Sabha, to bring any motion for the Saini govt to prove confidence in the House, the opposition will have to prove before the governor with the letters from a majority MLAs that the current government has lost numbers in the House. \"If the governor is convinced that the opposition has sufficient numbers, only then he can ask the government to prove confidence in the House,\" Yadav added.\n\nRefuting that that noconfidence motion cannot be brought within a period of six months from the last motion, Ram Narain Yadav, who has also served as an adviser to Punjab state assembly, said that it was only a perception. Actually there is no bar on such motion and the only condition is that the governor should be convinced that the ruling party has lost majority in the House, Yadav added.\n\nThe announcement of the three independent MLAs came as a major shot in the arm for the Congress just before the Lok Sabha elections in the state. Hooda called for immediate assembly elections in Haryana, saying that the BJP had lost its majority in Haryana.\n\n\"Now the BJP government has lost majority after the withdrawal of support from JJP and independents. Therefore, assembly elections should be conducted by immediately imposing President's rule in Haryana, because today not only the public but also the people who voted and supported BJP, are unhappy with the policies of the government,\" he said.\n\nHaryana PCC president Udai Bhan echoed his stand, saying: \"With the withdrawal of support by 3 MLAs and JJP's exit from the government, it is clear that a minority government is running the state. In such a situation, BJP has no right to remain in power. The government should face assembly elections.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, with three Independents retracting their support, the BJP currently only has the backing of three Independents and one HLP MLA, totaling 43 MLAs, sustaining its government.\n\nThe 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state go to the polls on May 25.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charkhi_Dadri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charkhi Dadri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charkhi Dadri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilokheri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nilokheri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nilokheri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109972835,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-21780,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 320, "textEnd": 326, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

As per the current strength of the House, the majority mark is 45.\n\nThe ruling BJP currently has 40 members, and with three MLAs withdrawing their support, its number has fallen to 43 in the House. After the decision of three Independents, the BJP has the support of two Independents, besides the support of the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) MLA Gopal Kanda. In March, after taking oath as new Chief Minister of the State, the Saini-led BJP government won the trust vote with six Independents and the lone MLA of the HLP extending their support to the BJP. In all, seven Independents had won in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, the BJP emerged as the single-largest party by winning 40 seats in the Assembly polls, but it fell short of six seats to form the government on its own. The BJP and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), which secured 10 seats in the polls decided to come together to form the government. In March, the BJP and JJP parted ways, after strained relations.\n\nAlso read | 3 JJP leaders join BJP in Haryana ahead of May 25 polls\n\nThe principal opposition Congress currently has 30 MLAs while Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has one member, and the JJP has 10 MLAs.\n\nIn Rohtak, the three Independent MLAs, Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri), said they were withdrawing support from the government, and were extending their support to the Congress. They made the announcement in the presence of Haryana Congress President Chaudhary Udaibhan and the Leader of Opposition in the Haryana State Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda.\n\nThe Independent MLAs jointly said the people had seen the workings of the BJP, and now there was no justification for giving another opportunity to the party. They said every section of society is hit by unemployment, inflation, and increasing crime under the present government's regime.\n\n'Sole objective of fighting this election is to save and redeem the soul of the nation'\n\nMr. Udaibhan said, \"With the withdrawal of support by the three MLAs and Jannayak Janta Party's (JJP) exit from the government, it is clear that a minority government is running the State. In such a situation, the BJP has no moral right to remain in power. The government should face Assembly election. This should be conducted by immediately imposing President's rule in Haryana.\"\n\nMr. Hooda said the MLAs have taken this decision keeping in mind the public sentiments. \"Their right decision, taken at the right time, will definitely bear fruit. Congress's victory is certain in the Lok Sabha and upcoming Assembly election.\"\n\nHaryana has a 90-member State Assembly, which at present has an effective strength of 88 members.

Now, after the decision of three Independents, the BJP has the support of two Independents, besides the support of the HLP MLA Gopal Kanda.\n\nThe principal Opposition Congress has 30 MLAs while Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has one member, and the JJP has 10 MLAs.\n\nThe Assembly election in Haryana are due in October-November later this year.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopal_Goyal_Kanda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gopal Goyal Kanda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/gcoi05/article68150424.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI03_13_2024_000167A.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The Haryana Congress on Thursday sent a letter to the governor's office seeking time on Friday to meet him and present a memorandum on the present political situation in the state.\n\nIn a separate letter on Wednesday, Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala wrote to the governor, saying the Saini government no longer commands a majority and there should be an immediate floor test.\n\nThree Independent MLAs on Tuesday withdrew support to the BJP government and announced they would back the Congress. The government which has the support of two other Independents is now two short of the majority mark in the 90-member state assembly.\n\nHowever, the House at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member each, while the total number of Independent MLAs are six.\n\nIn its letter, the Congress said that a party delegation led by Deputy CLP leader Aftab Ahmed and B B Batra, chief whip CLP, wants to meet the governor on May 10.\n\nChief Minister Saini again asserted that his government was not in trouble.\n\nOn Thursday, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the \"minority\" dispensation should resign on moral grounds.\n\n\"We have also sought time from the governor,\" Hooda said when asked to comment on the JJP writing a letter to the governor.\n\nHooda was campaigning in Bhiwani for party's Lok Sabha candidate Rao Dan Singh.\n\nReplying to another question, Hooda raised doubts whether all 10 JJP MLAs were onboard with their party, in a reference to some JJP MLAs indicating their support in recent days to the BJP.\n\n\"We are 30 MLAs...regarding JJP, it would have been better had they paraded 10 MLAs before the governor.\n\n\"There is no dispute about our MLAs. Some of their (JJP's) MLAs are supporting someone else...let them go to the governor with their 10 MLAs,\" he said.\n\nAfter withdrawal of support by the three Independents, Hooda said the Saini government is in a minority.\n\n\"On moral grounds, it should resign. President's rule should be imposed...we are demanding fresh elections in the state,\" the former chief minister said.\n\nTaking on both the BJP and the JJP whose alliance ended after Saini replaced Manohar Lal Khattar as Chief Minister in March, Hooda said, \"They entered into agreement to break the alliance. People understand this.\" People know there is a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP (in the Lok Sabha polls), others are \"vote kaatu\" (vote-cutting) parties.\n\nJJP leader Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said that the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the \"minority\" BJP government.\n\nChautala also said that if Hooda takes steps to bring down the Saini government, his party would support the move.\n\nHowever, the BJP government appears safe for now. According to prevailing norms, a no-trust motion against a government can't be moved within six months of the previous one. In this case, the BJP government in Haryana had faced the no-confidence motion in February.\n\nThe assembly elections are due in Haryana in October this year.

They have now extended their support to the Congress amid the Lok Sabha Elections 2024.\n\nThe development came amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of Haryana after replacing Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nIs the Haryana government under threat now? Will the Congress be able to topple the BJP government in Haryana? What happens next? Will this impact the Lok Sabha Elections 2024? Check out below:\n\nThe Haryana assembly has 90 members. A political party needs the support of 46 MLAs to cross the halfway mark in the Haryana assembly and form a government in the state.\n\nNow, the current party position in the assembly shows that the BJP has 41 MLAs. The Haryana BJP has the support of the lone Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) MLA and at least three independent MLAs (earlier, it had six independent MLAs in support).\n\nIn total, the ruling BJP has the support of 45 MLAs - just one short of crossing the halfway mark. Even with one less MLA, the BJP won't be able to form government in the state.\n\nThe Congress has 30 MLAs in the Haryana Assembly. With the support of three MLAs, its tally touches 33. This is 13 MLAs short of the majority mark.\n\nSo, neither the Congress nor the BJP will be able to form a government in Haryana in this scenario.\n\nHaryana may now witness a hung assembly - where no party has the majority's support to form the government.\n\nIf a state sees a hung assembly, then the Governor invites the leaders of the single largest party - in this case BJP - to form a temporary government for 10 days. The governor also gives that political party 10 days to gather support from other parties and prove the majority.\n\nIf the party is not able to prove a majority within these 10 days, then the government is dissolved by the governor and a re-election is conducted in the state.\n\nMilestone Alert!

The Haryana assembly elections are due in October this year.\n\nHowever, Parveen Attrey, media secretary to the Haryana Government, countered this, stating that the Nayab Singh Saini government still has the support of 47 MLAs. To come to this figure, he also listed the names of four MLAs of the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), which had withdrawn its support to the Saini government in March.\n\n\"We have 40 MLAs of our own, and we have the support of the Haryana Lokhit Party's Gopal Kanda, two Independents Rakesh Daulatabad (Badshahpur) and Nayan Pal Rawat (Prithla) and four JJP MLAs, Devender Babli (Tohana), Jogi Ram Sihag (Barwala), Ram Kumar Gautam (Narnaund) and Ram Niwas Surjakhera (Narwana),\" claimed Attrey.\n\nAttrey also noted that the Congress, under Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had brought a no-confidence motion against Saini's government on 23 February this year, and no fresh motion could be brought before a lapse of six months from that date.\n\nHooda, however, told ThePrint that the issue was not about a floor test but about morality.\n\n\"After the withdrawal of support by the three MLAs, the Nayab Singh Saini government has lost the moral authority to remain in power,\" he said over the phone. \"The Governor should immediately dismiss the government and impose President's Rule besides ordering early elections to the state assembly to respect the people's mandate.\"\n\nAlso Read: After BJP snubs Kuldeep Bishnoi for Hisar, backlash in Haryana's Adampur.

On 13 March, Saini won the confidence motion on 13 March, and the government continued with the backing of 47 MLAs -- 40 from the BJP, 6 Independents, and HLP's Kanda. Subsequently, Independent MLA Ranjit Singh resigned and was announced as the BJP candidate for the Hisar Lok Sabha seat, leaving the government with support from 46 members in the effective House of 88.\n\nWith Tuesday's episode, the Nayab Singh Saini government is left with the support of 43 MLAs -- BJP 40, Independents 2, and HLP 1 -- leaving it two short of the majority mark.\n\nDuring his Rohtak press conference, Hooda claimed that Haryana residents were fed up with the BJP's policies and the three Independent MLAs resigned in response. He also said that since the election announcement, almost 100 BJP leaders, including 40 MLAs, ex-MLAs, and ex-MPs, joined the Congress, reflecting a desire for change in leadership.", "source":

However, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini asserted that his Government is not in any trouble. His predecessor and party colleague M L Khattar also claimed that many MLAs are in touch with the BJP and there is \"nothing to worry \".\n\nIndependent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support to the ruling BJP in Haryana on Tuesday and announced that they would back the Congress.\n\nThe fast-paced political developments in the State come at a time when Lok Sabha polls are just a fortnight away and Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in October.\n\nSpeaking to media in Hisar, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala said if a no-confidence motion is brought in the Assembly, they will vote against the Saini Government. \"I want to tell Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda that going by the present numbers in the Assembly, when this Government is in a minority, if a step is taken that this government is brought down during (Lok Sabha) elections, then we will fully consider to support them in this from outside\".\n\n\"Now, the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the BJP government,\" Chautala said.\n\nReacting to this, Congress leader Hooda said, \"They should write to the Governor (that Government is in a minority)\".\n\nDushyant Chautala also ruled out reviving his party's alliance with the BJP. The two parties had snapped ties in March. \"I have made it quite clear that JJP will not go with BJP now,\" Chautala said and demanded that Saini should either prove majority or submit his resignation.\n\nThe 90-member Haryana Assembly at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania Assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10 in the House. INLD and Haryana Lokhit Party has one member. Independents are six. The Government has the support of two of the Independent legislators.\n\nIndependent MLA Nayan Pal Rawat said he had given unconditional support to the BJP in 2019 and it is continuing even now. \"The Government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Chief Minister Saini told reporters at Sirsa while replying to queries on the withdrawal of support.\n\nHowever, Hooda said the Saini Government is in a minority and it has no moral right to stay in power.\n\nINLD's lone MLA Abhay Singh Chautala said either the Government should prove it has a majority or else \"Governor's rule should be imposed\".\n\nHitting out at the Congress, Saini said the Opposition party's actions are only aimed at fulfilling the personal aspirations of some people. But the people of Haryana will not let the Congress' designs succeed, the chief minister said, adding the entire country is witnessing the \"misdeeds\" of the Opposition party.\n\nLater in Karnal, Saini said Congress has been rejected by various sections and is sinking. About the three Independent MLAs, Saini said, \"They are able legislators. How did they fall into the (Congress) trap.... Four days ago I called them and spoke to them,\" said Saini.\n\nFormer Chief Minister ML Khattar downplayed the developments.\"During election season, who is going where is not going to have much impact. Many MLAs are in touch with us also, so no one should worry about this,\" he told reporters in Karnal.\n\nIn Chandigarh, while replying to a question, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said the Saini Government had won the trust vote on March 13. \"How can we say that the Government is in a minority? It is intact and running as it was earlier,\" he told reporters.\n\nAsked if a no-confidence motion can be brought against the Government, the Speaker said, \"Usually, when a no-confidence motion is brought, another one can only be brought six months after that. It is a technical matter.\"\n\nHaryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said the party will write to the Governor stating that the Saini Government is in a minority and that it should be dismissed, the

Mr Chautala's move comes amidst a political upheaval sparked by the withdrawal of support from three independent MLAs and mounting tensions within the ruling BJP coalition.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Governor of Haryana Bandaru Dattatreya, Mr Chautala said that the recent resignations and withdrawals of support have left the ruling BJP alliance teetering on the brink of a minority status.\n\n\"I urge you to direct the appropriate authority to immediately call for a floor test to determine majority of government,\" Mr Chautala's letter to the Governor.\n\nThe call for a floor test stems from the recent switch of three Independent MLAs from the BJP faction to the Congress faction. On Tuesday, MLAs Sombir Sangwan (representing Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (from Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (of Nilokheri) declared their intention to cut support for the BJP administration during a press conference held in Rohtak. They were joined by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, and Udai Bhan, the state Congress chief.\n\nMr Chautala, leader of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) which is a former ally of the BJP, did not mince words in expressing his party's readiness to throw its weight behind an alternative government, signalling a potential alliance with the Congress.\n\n\"The government that was formed two months back is now in the minority because two of the MLAs who supported them - one from the BJP and the other an Independent MLA - have resigned. Three Independent MLAs who were supporting them have withdrawn their support and have written to the Governor. JJP has clearly said that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this government, we will support the motion,\" Mr Chautala said.\n\n\"We have also written to the Governor about it.

BJP commands 40 MLAs supported by three out of six independent candidates, meaning the ruling coalition is short of two MLAs to hit the majority. The Congress party boasts 30 MLAs with its count bolstered by three independent candidates. Should the JJP lend its support, the Congress's tally would rise to 43 MLAs.

But since the BJP had recently dumped the JJP and its then chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and independent MLA Ranjit Chautala had resigned - who are contesting Lok Sabha elections from Karnal and Hisar, respectively, the House strength now stands at 88.\n\nBJP Left With 40 MLAs\n\nTo further put the number in perspective - the BJP now has 40 MLAs with the support of two independents and an ally Haryana Lokhit Party sole MLA Gopal Kanda - that makes it to 43 out of 88.\n\nThe principal opposition Congress on the other hand has 30 MLAs and (now) the collective opposition with three independents plus INLD's lone MLA Abhay Chautala and an independent MLA Balraj Kundu stands at 35. It is also pertinent to note that at least three of JJP MLAs have also been seen openly siding with BJP post BJP's good-bye to its former ally JJP.\n\nNow much depends on the standing and voting of 10 JJP in case of no-trust motion or parading of the MLAs before Governor. Since the Congress had brought a no-trust move during the recent budget session, it can move another motion only in the next session which would be about four months from now. The state has its assembly elections due around September this year. Hence, no immediate threat!\n\nMLAs Who Withdrew Their Support From BJP\n\nMeanwhile, the three MLAs who withdrew support were- Charkhi Dadri MLA, Somveer Sangwan, Pundri MLA, Randhir Golan and Nilokheri MLA, Dharampal Gondar who also announced that they had withdrawn their support from BJP and now supported Congress. They made this announcement at a press conference which was also addressed by Congress state chief Udai Bhan and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Rohtak.\n\nThe MLAs trio held that every section of the society was unhappy with unemployment, inflation, increasing crime and the rules to have family ID, property ID in the BJP government.\n\nHooda On Imposing President's Rule In The State\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Hooda claimed that now with these MLAs withdrawing their support from the ruling party, the BJP had lost the majority and therefore the assembly elections should be held by immediately imposing President's rule in the state.\n\nHaryana Congress president Udai Bhan also said that \"with the withdrawal of support by the three MLAs and JJP's exit from the government, it was clear that a minority government was running the state. In such a situation, BJP has no right to remain in power and the government should face assembly elections,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free

Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharampal Gonder from Nilokheri, and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Dadri announced their decision during a press conference in Rohtak. Sangwan said that Rakesh Daultabad from Badshahpur was also expected to join them but was unable to reach the venue in time.\n\nAddressing the media, Dharam Pal Gondher expressed disappointment with the BJP government's handling of various issues.\n\n\"At the time when they needed our support to form the government we were called again and again...We had decided that till the time Manoharlal Khattar was in power, we would support. We are sad that he is not in power anymore...In the interest of the farmers we withdraw the support from the government,\" he said.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, Golan said the rising unemployment and inflation during the BJP's tenure in Haryana were key factors in their decision to withdraw support.\n\n\"For the last 4.5 years, we extended support to the BJP. Today unemployment and inflation are at their highest. Looking at this, we have withdrawn our support\".\n\nFormer Haryana chief minister and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda welcomed their saying it reflects the lack of trust in the current government and the growing support for Congress among the people.\n\n\"Their decision is right the right decision taken at the right time. It is in the interest of the people...There is a wave of Congress. I welcome them,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the presser, party's state unit chief Udai Bhan said, \"The three Independent MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Singh Gollen and Dharampal Gonder -- have withdrawn their support to the BJP government and extended their support to the Congress.\"\n\n\"I also want to say that present strength of (90-member) Haryana Assembly is 88, of which the BJP has 40 members. The BJP government earlier had support of JJP MLAs and Independents, but JJP had also withdrawn support and now Independents are also leaving.\"\n\n\"Nayab Singh Saini government is now a minority government.

In a letter to the Raj Bhavan, Shadi Lal Kapoor, secretary to the Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, wrote that a Congress delegation led by Deputy Leader of CLP Aftab Ahmed and party chief whip Bharat Bhushan Batra wants to submit a memorandum on the current political situation in Haryana.\n\nIn the 90-member Haryana assembly, the two MLAs -- former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Cabinet minister Ranjit Singh -- have already resigned from their seats as they are BJP candidates from Karnal and Hisar, respectively.\n\nThe Nayab Singh Saini government earlier enjoyed the support of 41 BJP MLAs, six out of seven Independents and the lone MLA of the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) Gopal Kanda.\n\nAfter the resignation by Khattar and Singh, the effective strength of the House came down to 88, with 46 MLAs supporting the government. On Tuesday, three Independent MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri, Randhir Singh Gollen from Pundri, and Dharampal Gonder from Nilokheri -- announced their support to the Congress.\n\nCurrently, the party-wise position in the Haryana assembly stands as such -- BJP (40), Congress (30), JJP (10), Independents (6), INLD (1) and HLP (1).\n\n\"Recent developments have unfolded when three of the six Independent MLAs who previously extended their support to the government in March 2024 have now announced the withdrawal of their support,\" Dushyant wrote.\n\nThe former deputy chief minister said that in the present circumstances, the JJP has a clear stance that it was not supporting the government and was open to extending support to any other political party for government formation.\n\nHighlighting Article 174 of the Constitution which provides the Governor the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve the state assembly, Dushyant said that in the SR Bommai Vs Union of India 1994 case, the Supreme Court has emphasised that the Governor has a Constitutional obligation to act judiciously and impartially in such matters and can call for the floor test to determine the majority of the government in the House.\n\n\"Considering the gravity of the current circumstances and the urgent need to reinstate stability and uphold democratic norms in Haryana, I respectfully implore Your Excellency to invoke your Constitutional prerogative as per Article 174 of the Constitution. I urge you to direct the appropriate authority to immediately call for floor test to determine the majority of the government. If the government fails to do so, it is essential for Your Excellency to fulfil your constitutional duty by imposing President's rule,\" Dushyant wrote in the letter.\n\nIn a press conference at Hisar, the JJP leader had announced Wednesday that his party would support any move by the Congress to topple the BJP government in Haryana and also extend outside support to the opposition-led government.\n\nHe had further said that the Saini government has now lost the moral right to stay in power and that Saini should either prove his majority on the House floor or submit his resignation on moral grounds.\n\nContacted by The Print Wednesday, Haryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta had said that he did not have any official information on the three Independent MLAs withdrawing support from the government.\n\n\"Whatever I know about the withdrawal of support is from the media reports. Officially, neither the MLAs have given me any information, nor the Congress leaders have sent any communication,\" he said.\n\n\"Generally, when a no-confidence motion is moved in the state assembly, the next motion can be moved only after six months. However, the governor can take any decision as a constitutional authority. If any orders come from the governor, he would go by that,\" Gupta added.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushil_manav@theprint.in",

With the House strength reduced to 88, the majority mark is 45. Technically, the BJP government has the support of 43 MLAs now, though it claimed on Tuesday that four Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs too may offer \"tactical assistance to the government if needed\", taking its strength to 47.\n\nThe three Independent MLAs who switched sides Tuesday -- Dharampal Gondher (Nilokheri), Randhir Golan (Pundri) and Sombir Sangwan (Dadri) - announced their decision in the presence of former Congress chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Rohtak.\n\nSoon after, Hooda said: \"This government should resign keeping in view the sentiments of the public. President's rule should be imposed in the state.\"\n\nHaryana BJP president Udai Bhan demanded that the Assembly elections in the state - due at the end of this year -- be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls on May 25. \"Saini has no right to stay in government for even a moment.\"\n\nCM Saini accused the Congress of engineering what had happened. \"Some MLAs have some ambitions. These days, the Congress is apparently fulfilling desires (of such people). People understand this. They also know who has what ambitions. The Congress has nothing to do with the needs of the people. They care only about their ambitions,\" he said.\n\nWhile the total strength of the House is 90, right now it is 88 as two MLAs resigned earlier to contest the Lok Sabha polls, both on BJP tickets. While former BJP CM Manohar Lal Khattar is the candidate from the Karnal Lok Sabha seat, Ranjit Singh Chautala, earlier an Independent MLA, is contesting on the BJP ticket from Hisar.\n\nTwo months ago, the BJP snapped ties with the JJP of Dushyant Chautala, whose 10 MLAs had helped it form the government in 2019. Of the JJP's 10 MLAs, at least six have distanced themselves from Chautala.\n\nThe Congress has 30 MLAs in the House. The support of the three Independents takes its tally to 33.\n\nRejecting the Congress's claims of the BJP government losing its majority, Saini's media secretary Praveen Attrey told The Indian Express that apart from the BJP's own 40 MLAs, the party had the support of two Independent MLAs, Nayan Pal Rawat and Rakesh Daultabad; Gopal Kanda of the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP); and four JJP MLAs, Devender Singh Babli, Ram Kumar Gautam, Jogi Ram Sihag and Ram Niwas Surjakhera.\n\n\"The BJP government thus has the support of 47 MLAs against the simple majority mark of 45,\" Attrey added.\n\nGolan, one of the Independents who moved from the BJP to the Congress, said: \"We kept supporting the BJP government honestly over the past four-and-a-half years. But today, inflation and unemployment have touched new heights, while farmers, labourers, traders, employees... everyone... is upset because of the concept of family ID and property ID.\" The IDs were launched by the Khattar government as one card for families to access government benefits.\n\nGolan said it was wrong to see their decision as \"opportunism\", and said it was actually \"a reflection of the public's voice\".\n\nHe also pointed out that Sangwan, among the Independents who crossed sides Tuesday, had earlier withdrawn support to the then BJP-JJP government during the farmer protests of 2020-21.\n\n\"All of us opposed the government in the Vidhan Sabha that time (farmer agitation). While we supported the good things of the government, we raised our voice on other issues in the Vidhan Sabha,\" Golan said, denying any \"pressure\" and underlining that they were \"Independent\".\n\nSangwan, who also talked about his opposition to the Khattar government during the farmer protests, claimed that one more MLA was expected to join them but could not due to some reasons.\n\nGondher, the third Independent now in the Congress corner, said Golan, Sangwan, he and another Independent MLA, Nayan Pal Rawat, had decided to support the BJP government as long as Khattar was the CM, indicating that the party's abrupt replacement of Khattar with Saini did not go down well. \"When our Senapati (Khattar) went away, it hurt us.\"\n\nPraising the decision of the three MLAs, Hooda said it showed that people had lost confidence in the current regime. \"They have taken the right decision at the right time... People have made up their mind to vote in a Congress government in the state.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This comes two days after three independent legislators withdrew their support to the Bharatiya Janata Party's government in the state and extended \"outside\" support to the Congress. To recall, after the 2019 assembly polls, the BJP entered into an alliance with Chautala's Jannayak Janata Party to form the government in Haryana. The two parties snapped their ties two months ago.\n\nHaryana may face a hung assembly scenario -- where no single party holds a majority to govern. In such a scenario, the governor extends an invitation to the leader of the single-largest party -- currently the BJP -- to initiate a government for 10 days. During this period, the party is granted the opportunity to secure support from other parties. Should the party fail to garner sufficient support within the timeframe, the governor dissolves the government -- paving the way for a fresh election in the state.\n\nIn the 2019 assembly polls, the BJP had emerged as the single-largest party and formed an alliance with the JJP, which has 10 MLAs. Two months ago, the BJP snapped ties with the JJP. While the total strength of the House is 90, right now it is 88 as two MLAs resigned earlier to contest the general elections -- both on BJP tickets. This has brought the majority mark to 45.\n\nThe BJP has 40 of its own MLAs and has claimed support of four JJP MLAs, taking its tally to 44. Meanwhile, the Congress has 30 MLAs in the House and the support of the three Independents takes its total to 33 seats. No single party seems to have a majority in Haryana. Separately, assembly elections are scheduled in the state in October.\n\nIn March, Manohar Lal Khattar resigned from the post of chief minister of Haryana, paving the way for party colleague and state unit chief Nayab Singh Saini to succeed him. Chautala was deputy chief minister to Khattar in the alliance government.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chautala announced that the he would support \"Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda\" if the latter initiates a move to topple the state government. The three Independent MLAs who switched sides Tuesday -- Dharampal Gondher (Nilokheri), Randhir Golan (Pundri), and Sombir Sangwan (Dadri) -- announced their decision in the presence of former CM Hooda in Rohtak. Soon after, Hooda said, \"This government should resign keeping in view the sentiments of the public. President's rule should be imposed in the state.\"\n\nAccording to reports, both the Congress and the JJP were waiting for each other to initiate action for a floor test. Reports suggested that the Congress is sceptical about collaborating with the JJP over its earlier alliance with the BJP. After submitting the letter to the governor, the JJP leader said, \"We have also written to the Governor about it.

The MLAs, namely Sombir Sangwan from Dadri, Randhir Singh Gollen from Pundri, and Dharampal Gonder from Nilokheri, made their announcement in a press conference held in Rohtak. Their decision to back the Congress has effectively reduced the state government to a minority in the 90-member assembly, which currently has 88 members due to vacancies.\n\nThe BJP, which holds 40 seats, is now two members short of the majority mark, despite having the support of two other Independents. This shift comes amidst signals of support for the BJP from some Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs, despite the JJP's withdrawal from the coalition in March. The Congress and JJP hold 30 and 10 seats respectively.\n\nAt the press conference, attended by Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan, the Independent MLAs voiced their discontent with the current government. They cited issues such as farmer distress, inflation, and unemployment as reasons for their withdrawal of support. \"The government should resign. President's rule should be imposed in the state and elections held. This is an anti-people government,\" Hooda stated.\n\nJJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala urged Hooda to initiate steps to dismantle the government which he claimed had lost the people's trust. He also suggested that Hooda should meet with the governor to discuss the situation further.\n\nThe Congress has confirmed that letters of withdrawal have been sent to the governor by the three MLAs. During their announcement, Gonder expressed their collective decision to support Congress was influenced by various societal issues including those affecting farmers and rising unemployment.\n\nUdai Bhan highlighted that with JJP withdrawing its support earlier and now with Independents leaving, Nayab Singh Saini's government has indeed become a minority and called for Saini's resignation.\n\nWith assembly elections in Haryana scheduled for October, Hooda thanked the three MLAs for their support and remarked on a favorable wave towards Congress in Haryana and across the country. He emphasized that their decision was in alignment with public sentiment favoring change.\n\nDespite these developments, Digvijay Chautala clarified over a phone interview that while he acknowledges the government's minority status as pointed out by Hooda, he did not confirm JJP's readiness to support Congress in forming a new government. He emphasized the need for Hooda to engage with both the governor and potentially with JJP to facilitate governmental change.\n\nAddressing concerns over unemployment and inflation at the press conference, Gollen reflected on their past support for BJP being driven by honesty but acknowledged that current societal challenges necessitated a change in allegiance. Sangwan also mentioned his opposition to certain policies during the farmers' agitation and his commitment to supporting Congress in future electoral endeavors.\n\nIn light of these political shifts, Haryana AAP president Sushil Gupta also commented on the situation, advocating for immediate dismissal of the Saini-led government due to its minority status.

Officially, neither the MLAs have given any information to me, nor the Congress leaders have sent any communication,\" he said.\n\n\"Generally, when a no-confidence motion is moved in the state assembly, the next motion can be moved only after six months. However, the governor can take any decision as a constitutional authority. If any orders come from the governor, he would go by that,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, on 23 February, the Congress led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda moved a no-confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government led by Manohar Lal Khattar. The motion was defeated in a voice vote.\n\nLater, on 12 March, the BJP replaced Khattar with Saini as Haryana CM, and a day later, Saini successfully moved a confidence motion.", "source": {"uri":

They said they are now backing the Congress.\n\n''It is evident that the BJP government in Haryana no longer commands a majority,'' former deputy chief minister and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Chautala said in his letter to the governor on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini maintained that his government is not in trouble.\n\nHe told reporters in Karnal on Thursday that his government won a confidence vote in March and \"if it comes to seeking the trust vote, I will do it again when the time comes\".\n\n''You ask Dushaynt Chautala how many MLAs he has got,'' he said, challenging the claim that his government has lost the majority in the House.\n\nHis predecessor M L Khattar claimed that many MLAs are in touch with the BJP and there is ''nothing to worry about''.\n\nIn the letter, Chautala drew Dattatreya's attention to the \"current political turmoil in the state\" and urged him to direct the appropriate authority to immediately call for a floor test.\n\nBJP's former ally JJP had told reporters on Wednesday that it is ready to help the Congress topple the government.\n\nIndependent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support to the ruling BJP in Haryana on Tuesday.\n\nThe 90-member Haryana assembly at present has an effective strength of 88 with Karnal and Rania assembly seats being vacant. The BJP has 40 MLAs, the Congress 30 and the JJP 10. The Indian National Lok Dal and Haryana Lokhit Party have one member. There are six Independents.\n\nChautala wrote that after the Saini government demonstrated its majority in the Vidhan Sabha with the support of several Independent MLAs, Independent legislator Ranjit Singh Chautala resigned.\n\nGiven these developments, including the withdrawal of support by the three Independents, it is evident that the incumbent government no longer commands a majority in the assembly, Chautala said.\n\nReferring to Article 174 of the Constitution, the JJP leader said that the article \"confers upon the Governor the authority to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the legislative assembly\". Chautala mentioned the landmark case S R Bommai case and said the Supreme Court had clarified the \"Governor's discretion in determining the majority of a government\".\n\n\"The court emphasised that a Governor has a constitutional obligation to act judiciously and impartially in such matters and can call for a floor test to determine a government's majority,'' he said in the letter.\n\nConsidering the gravity of the current circumstances and the \"urgent need to reinstate stability and uphold democratic norms in Haryana\", Chautala urged the Governor to invoke his constitutional prerogative as per Article 174.\n\nCalling for an \"immediate floor test\", the JJP leader said, if the government fails to do so, it is essential for the Governor to fulfil his constitutional duty by imposing President's Rule in the state. \"This action is imperative to ensure the continued governance of the state in accordance with constitutional norms,'' he mentioned.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chautala had urged the Congress to take steps to bring down the Saini government.\n\nCurrently, the Saini government has the support of two of the Independent legislators.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type":

This development comes just two days after three Independent MLAs withdrew their support from the BJP government, pledging their support to the Congress party.\n\nIn his letter, he urges the Governor to call for a Floor Test immediately to make the Government prove its majority and impose President's Rule if the Government fails to do so. \"Given the developments and the clear stance of the party, i.e., JJP, which does not extend its support to the present government and is open to backing any other political party for government formation, it is evident that the incumbent government no longer commands a majority in the legislative assembly,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"Considering the current political situation in the state, it is clear that the present state government is in a minority. In view of this, I have written a letter to the Governor of Haryana, requesting him to convene a floor test in the Legislative Assembly. We do not support the current government, and our doors are open to support any other political party in forming the government in Haryana,\" said Chautala.\n\nHe further said that now it's up to Congress to take this step by seeking a floor test, and the Governor has the authority to order a floor test to determine if the Government has the necessary strength. If it fails to demonstrate majority support, the Governor can then promptly impose the President's Rule in the state.\n\n\"The government that was formed two months back is now in the minority because two of the MLAs who supported them - one from the BJP and the other an Independent MLA - have resigned. Three Independent MLAs who were supporting them have withdrawn their support. JJP has clearly said that if a No Confidence Motion is brought against this Government, we will support the Motion. We have also written to the Governor about it. Now, Congress has to take this step (seeking a Floor Test)...The Governor has the power to order a Floor Test to see if the Government has the strength and if it doesn't have the majority immediately implement the President's Rule in the state,\" he said.\n\nThe demand for a floor test arises from the recent defection of three Independent MLAs from the BJP faction to the Congress faction.\n\nThree independent candidates, who earlier sided with the BJP, have now withdrawn their support and extended it to the Congress. According to reports, former CM Hooda and Congress state chief Uday Bhan have informed that MLA Sombir Sangwan from Dadri, MLA Dharampal Gondar from Nilokheri, and Randhir Golan from Pundri have declared support to the Congress.\n\nChautala has also announced that his party would vote against the Nayab Singh Saini-led government in case a no-confidence motion is moved by the Leader of Opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Chautala said, \"If the BJP government is toppled quickly, they would provide support from the outside to facilitate the government's downfall.\" He emphasised that it is now up to the Congress to decide whether they will take steps to topple the BJP government.\n\nChautala clarified that they would support from the outside as long as their whip has the power, and their MLAs would vote according to the whip's instructions. He further added that if a floor test were conducted today, JJP MLAs would vote to overthrow the government.\n\nNotably, JJP, an offshoot of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), holds 10 seats in the 90-seat Haryana assembly. In October 2019, the party entered into an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to establish a coalition government. However, the partnership dissolved in March of this year.\n\nAlso Read: Haryana political crisis: JJP to vote against BJP govt if no-confidence motion moved, says Dushyant Chautala", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arushi_jaiswal@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Arushi Jaiswal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legislative assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/05/dushyant-chautala-1-1715239522.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 3689, "textEnd": 3701}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He told reporters in Karnal that his Government won a confidence vote in March and \"if it comes to seeking the trust vote, I will do it again when the time comes\".\n\nThe BJP currently has 40 MLAs in the Assembly, shy of the majority mark of 45 in the now 88-member House. Technically, the BJP Government has the support of 43 MLAs (including Independents) now, though it claimed on Tuesday that four JJP MLAs too may offer \"tactical assistance to the Government if needed\", taking its strength to 47.\n\nThe JJP had pulled out of the BJP coalition Government in March 2024. Of the JJP's 10 MLAs, at least six have distanced themselves from Chautala.\n\nThe Congress has 30 MLAs in the House. The support of the three Independents takes its tally to 33.\n\nChautala drew Dattatreya's attention to the \"current political turmoil in the State\" and urged him to direct the appropriate authority to immediately call for a floor test. The JJP said it is ready to help the Congress topple the Government. Independent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri) and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support to the ruling BJP in Haryana on Tuesday.\n\nSaini's predecessor ML Khattar claimed that many MLAs are in touch with the BJP and there is \"nothing to worry about\".\n\nChautala wrote that after the Saini Government demonstrated its majority in the Vidhan Sabha with the support of several Independent MLAs, Independent legislator Ranjit Singh Chautala resigned. Given these developments, including the withdrawal of support by the three Independents, it is evident that the incumbent Government no longer commands a majority in the Assembly, Chautala said.\n\nReferring to Article 174 of the Constitution, the JJP leader said the article \"confers upon the Governor the authority to summon, prorogue, and dissolve the legislative Assembly\". Chautala mentioned the landmark case S R Bommai case and said the Supreme Court had clarified the \"Governor's discretion in determining the majority of a Government\".\n\n\"The court emphasised that a Governor has a constitutional obligation to act judiciously and impartially in such matters and can call for a floor test to determine a Government's majority,\" he said in the letter.", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pioneer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Haryana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Haryana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saini", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislative_assemblies_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislative assemblies of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranjit Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2024/story/images/big/testing-times-ahead-for-bjp-in-haryana-2024-05-10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He blamed the Congress for creating the confusion that his government is in trouble.\n\n\"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Saini told reporters at Sirsa when asked to comment on the withdrawal of support.

This action follows political turmoil triggered by the withdrawal of support by three independent MLAs and increasing strains within the ruling BJP coalition.\n\nIn a letter directed to Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya, Mr. Chautala expressed that recent resignations and withdrawals of support have pushed the ruling BJP alliance dangerously close to a minority status.\n\nMr. Chautala urged the Governor to direct the appropriate authority to immediately call for a floor test to determine the majority of the government.\n\nThe demand for a floor test arises from the recent defection of three Independent MLAs from the BJP faction to the Congress faction. On Tuesday, MLAs Sombir Sangwan (representing Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (from Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (of Nilokheri) announced their decision to withdraw support for the BJP government during a press conference held in Rohtak. They were accompanied by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, and Udai Bhan, the state Congress chief.\n\nAlso Read: Asaduddin Owaisi Challenges PM Modi; Says 'Not Just 15 Seconds, Take An Hour'\n\nMr. Chautala, the leader of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), formerly allied with the BJP, was straightforward in indicating his party's readiness to support an alternative government, hinting at a possible alliance with the Congress.\n\nMr. Chautala explained that the government formed just two months ago is now in a minority position due to resignations and withdrawals of support. He noted that two supporting MLAs, one from the BJP and one Independent, have resigned, while three Independent MLAs have withdrawn their support and communicated this to the Governor. Mr. Chautala stated that the JJP is clear in its stance: if a No Confidence Motion is initiated against this government, they will support it.\n\nMr. Chautala also mentioned that they had informed the Governor about the situation. He emphasized that it's now the Congress's responsibility to take the necessary steps for a Floor Test. He added that the Governor has the authority to order a Floor Test to determine the government's strength, and if it's found lacking majority, President's Rule should be implemented in the state.\n\nCurrently, the Haryana Assembly, comprising 90 seats, has 88 members, with the majority mark set at 45. The BJP holds 40 MLAs, backed by three out of six independent candidates, falling short of two MLAs to reach the majority mark. The Congress party has 30 MLAs, with its count further bolstered by three independent candidates. If the JJP extends its support, the Congress's tally would increase to 43 MLAs.

The government needs the support of two more members to continue holding the reins of the government. The three independent MLAs who withdrew support said they would back the Congress in the Lok Sabha 2024 polls.\n\nHow do numbers look in the Haryana Assembly? The BJP has 40 members in the current Assembly (after the resignation of Manohar Lal Khattar as Karnal MP). Since three Independent MLAs withdrew their support, the saffron party now enjoys the backing of only two. That's 42! Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) MLA Gopal Kanda also extended his support to the BJP, pushing the BJP's number to 43 - two short of majority.\n\nCongress has 30 MLAs. Since a political realignment had occurred amid BJP-JJP differences, Dushyant Chautala is willing to extend his party's support to the grand old party. \"I want to tell Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda that going by the present numbers in the Assembly, if a step is taken that this government is brought down during (Lok Sabha) elections, then we will fully consider to support them in this. Now, the Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the BJP government,\" Dushyant Singh Chautala said.\n\nWith JJP's 10 MLAs and three Independents, Congress would hold 43 MLAs in its kitty.\n\nIndependent MLA Balraj Kundu also claims to be opposing the government. If he extends support to Congress, the party will have 44 MLAs - one short of the crossing the half-way mark.\n\nDoes Om Prakash Chautala hold the key? Om Prakash Chautala-led Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has just one MLA in the Assembly. If INLD supports the BJP, it would result in a hung Assembly with 44 MLAs on both sides. But if Om Prakash Chautala supports the Congress, the grand-old party needs to show the letter of support to the Governor to form the next government.\n\nHow is Congress working this out? With the support of three Independent MLAs, JJP's 10 legislators and if independent Balraj Kundu, too, extends his support to the grand-old party, Congress will have to reach out to INLD to pull them to its side.\n\nCongress is, however, seeking the imposition of a President's Rule and fresh Assembly elections in Haryana. It has also requested that JJP and others write to the governor.\n\n\"We are going to write to the Governor that three Independent MLAs have withdrawn support, and they have extended support to our party... the government is in the minority, and they have no right to stay in power. We will demand that the government be dismissed, President's Rule be imposed, and fresh elections be held,\" Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said.\n\n\"Likewise, the JJP should also write a letter stating that the government be dismissed. INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu, who claim to be opposing the government, should also write similar letters to the Governor,\" senior Congress leader BB Batra added.\n\nMilestone Alert!

The Legislative Assembly elections will also be held later this year.\n\nChautala on Wednesday demanded that Saini should resign on moral grounds. \"The three independents have sent their withdrawal of support to the governor,\" he said. \"We shall also urge the governor and even send it in writing to him seeking directions to the state government to prove majority.\"\n\nThe Congress' Haryana unit, meanwhile, said that it will write to the governor seeking imposition of President's Rule followed by Assembly elections, reported PTI.\n\nSenior Congress leader BB Batra said the Jannayak Janta Party, which was an ally of the BJP in Haryana till March, should also write to the governor clarifying that they were not supporting the present government.\n\nOn the other hand, the Haryana chief minister has asserted that his government is not in trouble and working strongly.\n\nOn March 12, Saini took oath as the chief minister of Haryana on Tuesday, hours after his predecessor Khattar and all the ministers in his Cabinet resigned from their posts.\n\nA day later, he won the floor test in the state Assembly.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"},

They don't know how many leaders of the other parties will stand with us...\"\n\nThree independent MLAs withdrew their support to the BJP in Haryana amid the Lok Sabha polls and within two months of Nayab Singh Saini taking over as Chief Minister of the state.\n\nThe three MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan (Charkhi Dadri), Randhir Golan (Pundri),and Dharampal Gondar (Nilokheri) - had said they have decided to withdraw support from the Saini government and extend support to the Congress during the elections.\n\nIn the House of 90, the BJP has 39 MLAs, the Congress has 30, the Jan Nayak Janata Party has 10, the Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has one, and the Indian National Lok Dal has one, along with seven Independents.\n\nThe BJP which had 41 MLAs initially was reduced to 39 when the Karnal and Rania seats fell vacant following the resignation of two MLAs.\n\nEarlier six out of seven Independent MLAs used to support the BJP. With three Independents withdrawing their support, the BJP at present, has the support of three Independents and one HLP MLA, making it a government of 43 MLAs.

It is for the Congress party to initiate a step. Also, other Opposition MLAs who want to change the BJP government, to topple the present government that has lost majority, should also write to the governor. We have written to the governor seeking a floor test. The current strength of the House is 88 and the government has to reach the majority mark of 45. His Excellency the Governor has to get the floor test conducted. We shall see how many MLAs support the government or Opposition,\" Chautala, a former BJP ally, said on Thursday.\n\nAccusing the BJP of horse-trading, Chautala said, \"We used to think that horse-trading has stopped but BJP has relaunched it in the state in a different manner. At a time when the whip is issued, all party MLAs have to duly follow it and vote accordingly. I would reiterate that the previous no-confidence motion was moved against the government led by Manohar Lal Khattar. It is for the governor to see if he can get the floor test conducted and to see if the present government has a majority or not. If the government fails to prove its majority on the floor of the House, President's rule should be imposed.\"\n\nIn the 88-member Haryana Assembly, BJP currently has 40 MLAs, Congress 30 and JJP 10. There are six Independents and one MLA each from the Indian National Lok Dal and the Haryana Lokhit Party. The two seats of Karnal and Rania Assembly constituencies are vacant after Manohar Lal Khattar and Ranjit Singh resigned to become the BJP's Lok Sabha candidates from Karnal and Hisar, respectively.\n\nIn his letter to the governor, Chautala mentioned that after Saini assumed office in March 2024, the government had demonstrated its majority in the Vidhan Sabha with the support of several Independent MLAs. \"Subsequently, one Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala resigned and his resignation was accepted on 30th April, 2024. Recent developments have unfolded with three out of the six Independent MLAs who previously extended their support to the government in March 2024, withdrawing their backing,\" the letter states.\n\n\"Given these developments and the clear stance of my party, JJP, which does not extend its support to the present government and is open to backing any other political party for government formation, it is evident that the incumbent government no longer commands a majority in the legislative assembly,\" it adds.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bhupinder Singh Hooda had told The Indian Express that if Chautala writes to the governor and parades his MLAs in front of the governor, then Hooda would also send a Congress delegation led by Rohtak MLA Batra and seek a floor test for the present government.\n\n\"We are also seeking an appointment with the governor.

A past master at outmanoeuvring rivals - and party colleagues - he had reportedly convinced four Independent MLAs to withdraw support to the BJP government and extend the same to the Congress, over personal meetings.\n\nHowever, word got out, and only three made it to the Rohtak press conference led by Hooda, and announced they had switched sides.\n\nOne more, and the Nayab Singh Saini-led government could have found itself short of a majority. Right now, with 40 BJP MLAs, two Independents and one Haryana Lokhit Party legislator backing it, the Saini government has a strength of 43, plus claims support of four Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) MLAs, in a House whose effective strength is 88. Even if the JJP moves for the disqualification of these four, the BJP would still make the majority mark of 43, in a House with its strength reduced to 84.\n\nSources said that the game was not over yet and Hooda was still in touch with other Independent MLAs and the JJP's 10 MLAs, whose loyalties to Dushyant Chautala are suspect.\n\nOne of the Independent MLAs now with the Congress, Sombir Sangwan, told The Indian Express: \"Wait till June 4... As soon as the Lok Sabha election results are out, many BJP MLAs will also be ready to shift sides.\"\n\nEven if the Saini government survives, the Assembly elections are less than five months away and Hooda has successfully sent out the impression that \"there is an environment in favour of the Congress in the state\", a leader pointed out. \"Independent MLAs go to an opposition party only when they think that a change of government is certain,\" says Sampat Singh, a Congress leader and a six-time former MLA.\n\nCongress sources said that the three Independent MLAs who have announced support to the party would be considered for Congress tickets from their constituencies. Sangwan indicated he would be more than glad to get one: \"If the Congress gives a ticket, I will accept it and contest.\"\n\nCongress supporters also pointed out that apart from adding to the party numbers (the Congress has 30 MLAs in the House), the Independents bring with them the support of different caste groups. While Sangwan is a Jat, Dharampal Gondher belongs to a Scheduled Caste, and Randhir Golan comes from the Ror community.\n\nAt a personal level, the development consolidates Hooda's position as the foremost Congress leader in Haryana, after having already managed to get the lion's share in the distribution of tickets for the Lok Sabha elections. For nearly a year, rivals Kumari Selja, Randeep Surjewala and Kiran Choudhry have been trying to outsmart Hooda, having joined hands for the purpose.\n\nWhat Hooda perhaps did not account for was the statement by JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, former BJP ally and ex-deputy CM, on Wednesday that he was ready to support the Congress if Hooda initiated a move to topple the state government. On Thursday, Dushyant shot off a letter to the Governor seeking a floor test.\n\nImplying that the JJP is \"the BJP's B-team\", Hooda had replied to Chautala's statement saying that he should parade his MLAs before the Governor if he is so keen to topple the government, and that he would do the same then for the Congress. Privately, Hooda's supporters said they were apprehensive that Chautala's \"game plan\" was \"to \"divide the votes of Opposition\". And that Hooda would rather have President's rule than try forming a government for the few months left before the elections if such a scenario emerges.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sukhbir_siwach@indianexpress.com", "name": "Sukhbir Siwach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rohtak"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiran_Choudhry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiran Choudhry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selja_Kumari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selja Kumari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randeep_Surjewala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randeep Surjewala"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/hooda-pulse.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1288, "textEnd": 1294}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

That takes it to 43, two short of the majority mark of 45 in assembly that currently has a strength of 88.\n\nThe Congress has 30 lawmakers, the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) has 10, and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has one. In addition, one independent legislator -- Balraj Kundu from Meham -- has not made his position clear.\n\nIf they all oppose the government, there will have 45 votes against the state government.\n\nAll eyes will be on the JJP, a former ally of the BJP which pulled support from the erstwhile Manohar Lal Khattar government in a dramatic move in March, prompting the BJP to appoint Saini as the chief minister.\n\nJJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said that Hooda should meet the governor and claim that the government was in a minority. \"Now, we are in Opposition and the JJP will work to topple this government. Hooda should talk to JJP and independents and stake claim to form new government,\" he added.\n\nFamily members of two JJP legislators -- Ram Karan Kala and Ishwar Singh -- have joined the Congress while a third, Jogi Ram Sihag, has announced that he would campaign for the BJP. If the JJP abstains, it will help the ruling party.\n\nSaini won the trust vote in a special session of the assembly on March 13, a day after being appointed in place of his mentor Manohar Lal Khattar. The maximum period between two sessions of the assembly cannot exceed six months, which means that the governor will have to summon the House before September 13. At that time, Saini could face a floor test -- just weeks before assembly elections are scheduled in the state. To be sure, if the BJP wins the assembly by-election on May 25, then his government will gain a majority of one in the 90-member House.\n\nBut Sangwan said that another independent, Rakesh Daultabad from Badshahpur, will join the dissidents soon.\n\nGonder said that the five independents had made a commitment to Khattar, not Saini.\n\n\" As our commander was ousted from power, we have nothing to do with Nayab Singh Saini. We have decided to support the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls and assembly elections too. The farmers and sarpanches [village chiefs] were mounting pressure on us to support the Congress,\" he added.\n\nSangwan said that he supported the Congress's non-confidence motion against the Khattar government during the farmers' stir and backed Saini in the trust vote as he made a promise to Khattar.\n\n\"On some occasions, we backed both the Congress and the BJP inside and outside the assembly, according to prevailing situations. Now, we will support Hooda sahab and more independent MLAs will join them soon,\" he added.\n\nDaultabad could not be reached for comment.\n\nHaryana BJP leader, Jawahar Yadav said that there was no danger to the BJP government. \" The government has the numbers. The Nayab Saini government won a vote of confidence on March 13. If a situation arises where the government has to prove its majority, we will do it emphatically on the floor of the House,'' Yadav said.\n\nCM Nayab Saini said that these MLAs have decided to support Congress by assuming that their personal aspirations will be fulfilled there.\n\nGolan said that anger against the BJP government was simmering and they have decided to back Congress on the advice given by public. \"Every section of the society is upset from BJP rule. We want Hooda led Congress government in Haryana,\" he added.\n\nThe Congress remained tight-lipped over the issue, with functionaries suggesting that the party leadership was focusing on the Lok Sabha campaign.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party",

Congress has sought time to meet the Governor.\n\nIn the letter to the Haryana governor, Chautala whose party the JJP pulled out of the coalition with the ruling BJP in March, said that when the present Chief Minister (Naib Saini) assumed office in March 2024, the government demonstrated its majority in the Vidhan Sabha with the support of several Independent MLAs. One Independeni MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala resigned and his resignation was accepted on 30th April 2024.\n\nIn the letter, Dushyant said, \"recent developments have unfolded with three out of the six independent MLAs who previously extended their support to the government in March 2024, withdrawing their backing\". The JJP chief referred to three Independent MLAs Sombir Sangwan (Dadri), Randhir Singh Gollen (Pundri), and Dharampal Gonder (Nilokheri) withdrew support to the Naib Singh Saini led BJP government and extended \"external support\" to the Congress. Significantly, the three Independent MLAs made the announcement at a presser alongside former CM and Congress veteran Bhupinder Singh Hooda thereby putting the BJP government on the backfoot.\n\nDushyant Chautala's letter to the Governor seeking a floor test has only added to the Naib Singh Saini led BJP government's woes.\n\n\"Given these developments and the clear stance of my party i.e. JJP which does not extend its support to the present government and is open to backing any other political party for government formation. it is evident that the incumbent government no longer commands a majority in the legislative assembly,\" Dushyant wrote in his letter to the Governor.\n\nWhile referring to Article I74 of the Constitution of India which confers upon the Governor the authority to summon, prorogue and dissolve the legislative assembly, the JJP chief urged Dattatreya to pass directions to the appropriate authority to conduct a floor test to determine the majority of the government.\n\n\"If the government fails to do so, it is essential for your excellency to fulfill your constitutional duty by imposing President's rule in the state. This action is imperative to ensure the continued governance in the State in accordance with constitutional norms. I trust in your Excellency's wisdom and commitment to upholding the sanctity of democracy and rule of of law in our beloved state. Your prompt action in this matter is earnestly solicited for the welfare and prosperity of the people of Haryana,\" added the JJP chief.\n\nIn a recent interview, Dushyant Chautala had stated that he will extend support to the Congress if the grand old party moved a no-confidence motion against the Naib Saini led BJP government. All eyes are now on the two other two independents other than the rebels withdrawing support to the BJP government. In the 88-member current strength Haryana assembly, the BJP has 40 MLAs while the Congress and the JJP has 30 and 10 MLAs respectively. The BJP is three short of the majority mark.\n\nHaryana CM Naib Saini has targeted the opposition over the present political crisis in the state. Taking a dig at Bhupendra Hooda and Dushyant Chautala at a presser, CM Naib Saini said, \"These people (Bhupendra Hooda, Dushyant Chautala) are daydreaming. The public has rejected them. Such people are not going to come to power. These people work to promote corruption, exploit the public and harass people. When Haryana assembly elections will be held in September, the BJP government will be formed in the state with a big majority.\"\n\nReferring to once coalition partner Dushyant Chautala, CM Naib Saini said, \"What happened in the Haryana assembly? Everyone has seen this. What MLAs does Dushyant Chautala have that he is talking about minority? Dushyant Chautala should see for himself whether he has any MLAs or not. If needed, we will get the vote of confidence once again.\"", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nawab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislative_assemblies_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State legislative assemblies of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranjit Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/09-05-2024/1200-675-21425850-thumbnail-16x9-har-aspera.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The two alliance partners had severed their ties on March 12 after remaining in power for over four years, thus making the BJP dependent on the support of six Independent MLAs and lone Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) legislator Gopal Kanda.\n\nThe Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who was instrumental in getting the three Independent MLs to withdraw support to the BJP, said chief minister Nayab Singh Saini should resign because the BJP has lost the mandate. \"We demand the imposition of President's rule in the state,'' he added.\n\nHis son Deepender Hooda, a Rajya Sabha MP, said the BJP government is now in the minority. The five-year term of the present assembly ends on November 3 and the elections are expected to be held in October.\n\nCan a motion of no confidence be brought before six months?\n\nSince the intervening period between holding two sessions of the state assembly, as per the Constitution, should not be less than six months, the governor will have to summon the House before September 13.\n\n\"However, the six-month stipulation need not apply if a motion of no confidence motion is sought by the opposition. There has been instance when multiple no confidence motions have been brought in the legislatures well before the six months of the motion being first moved,\" said former additional secretary of Haryana assembly, Ram Narain Yadav.\n\nExperts said that the Governor can also use his discretionary powers under Article 163 (1) and ask the government to prove its majority.\n\nConstitutional experts also said that there is a difference between seeking vote of confidence (which chief minister Nayab Saini sought on March 13) and a motion of no confidence (which the opposition moved in February's budget session).\n\nPresent situation in House\n\nAs of now, the BJP has 40 MLAs in the 88-member assembly. Of the 90 seats in the House, Karnal and Rania assembly seats have fallen vacant due to the resignation of former chief minister ML Khattar and independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chutala.\n\nSo, going by the 88 MLAs in the House, the BJP would need 45 to pass the floor test. The BJP with 40 MLAs can still count on the support of Independent MLAs from Prithla and Badshahpur, Nayan Pal Rawat and Rakesh Daulatabad besides Gopal Kanda of the HLP. However, even then it would get them to the 43 mark, two short of a simple majority.\n\nComplicated equation\n\nOf the 10 JJP MLAs, family members of two legislators, including Ram Karan Kala and Ishwar Singh, have joined the Congress while Jogi Ram Sihag has announced that he would campaign for the BJP. A couple of JJP MLAs like Devender Babli and Ram Kumar Gautam who are exploring ticket opportunities for the assembly elections are in touch with the BJP leadership.\n\nPolitical experts said the JJP which had abstained from voting during the March 13 vote of confidence sought by the newly formed Nayab Singh Saini government can again resort to abstention. Even if three JJP MLAs abstain from voting in the House, it would bring down the number of MLAs present and vote to 85 and make it easy for the BJP to win the trust vote with even 43 MLAs.\n\nHaryana BJP leader Jawahar Yadav said there was no danger to the BJP government. \" The government has the numbers. The Nayab Saini government won a vote of confidence on March 13. If a situation arises where the government has to prove its majority, we will do it emphatically on the floor of the House,'' Yadav said.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Congress leader Bhupender Hooda has also sought time from the governor to demand an assembly session to prove the Saini government's majority.BJP is confident of securing its government in Haryana, even as JJP and Congress has sought the governor's intervention for a floor test of the Nayab Saini-led government.

Till a few months ago, he was deputy chief minister in the BJP-JJP alliance government in Haryana.\n\nSimilarly, Congress leader Bhupender Hooda also said he has sought time from the governor and would demand that an assembly session be called so that the Saini government would prove its majority on the floor of the House.\n\nPolitical temperature has risen in Haryana after three independent MLAs withdrew their support from the BJP government there. The MLAs had made the announcement in the presence of Hooda, the leader of the opposition in the assembly.\n\nHooda took a dig at Chautala saying that first he should ensure that all 10 MLAs of JJP are with him or not.

This move comes after three Independent MLAs withdrew their support from the BJP government and pledged their support to the Congress party.\n\nIn a letter to Governor Bandaru Dattatreya, Chautala urged for an immediate floor test to be conducted, stating, \"Given the developments and the clear stance of the JJP, which does not support the present government and is open to backing any other political party for government formation, it is evident that the incumbent government no longer commands a majority in the legislative assembly.\"\n\nChautala emphasized that the current political situation in Haryana indicates that the present state government is in the minority. He stated, \"We do not support the current government, and our doors are open to support any other political party in forming the government in Haryana.\"\n\nChautala further explained that it is now up to the Congress to initiate a floor test.

He stated that the JJP would provide support from the outside to facilitate the government's downfall.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the JJP, an offshoot of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), holds 10 seats in the 90-seat Haryana assembly.

In the 90-member State Assembly, which currently has an effective strength of 88, the BJP government led by Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini appears to be in a minority with 43 MLAs by its side -- it needs 45 for a majority. But BJP leaders assert that their government is under 'no threat' and if there be any need, 'other MLAs' will support them -- an indicator of support from disgruntled MLAs of the JJP. The Congress and the JJP have come out all guns blazing at the BJP, but appear to be moving with a guarded approach by putting the onus to initiate the process of bringing down the incumbent government on each other. Both parties have asked Governor Bandaru Dattatreya to intervene. While the Congress has demanded immediate Assembly polls under President's rule, the JJP has asked the Governor to seek an immediate 'floor test' to determine the majority of the incumbent government in the Legislative Assembly.\n\nThe Congress and the JJP are trying to consolidate their base in the midst of the general election and in the run-up to the Assembly election, which is due to be held in normal course in October. At least two of the 10 JJP MLAs have declared their support to BJP candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, and it is getting hard for the JJP to keep its flock together. After parting ways with the BJP, the JJP, which draws its support largely from the agrarian class, primarily the Jat community, has upped the ante against its former partner. In March this year, when the BJP replaced Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini, it indicated the party's strategy to sharpen its caste-based politics pivoting towards the non-Jat constituency. Haryana witnessed a violent pro-Jat quota stir in the year 2016 and the agitation left Jats and non-Jats pitted against each other, straining inter-community relations. The Congress appears to be channelising its energy to form the next government for a full term of five years, instead of focusing on any possibility of a short-term gain. The political turmoil has cast a long shadow of doubt on the Saini government's legislative majority.

According to sources, a few of Chautala's MLAs are said to be in touch with the BJP.\n\nThe MLAs met the former Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday afternoon, said sources. The meeting was held at the home of Minister of State Mahipal Dhanda in Panipat. Four JJP MLAs were present during the meeting with Manohar Lal Khattar and Mahipal Dhanda.\n\nMeanwhile, Dushyant Chautala on Thursday said that he has written to the Governor and sought a floor test in the state assembly. In a message on social media platform X, Chautala said his party does not support the current government, however, they are open to support any other party who is willing to form government in the state.\n\n\"In various constituencies, we have seen JJP MLAs working with BJP leaders. If they shift party, they also have to face infighting by the BJP's local cadre and it remains to be seen whether they would be accepted or not,\" said JJP's chief media coordinator, Deepkamal Saharan.\n\nThe political crisis in the BJP-led government in Haryana stemmed earlier this week when party MLAs Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Singh Gollen and Dharampal Gonder stopped supporting the BJP government. Following this, a press conference was held by Chautala where he claimed that the BJP government now has a minority.\n\n\"If the BJP government is in minority, we will support it from outside. Now Congress has to think whether it will take any step to topple the government or not. As opposition, we are in favour of toppling the government.

According to reports, JJP's Devender Singh Babli, Jogi Ram Sihag and Ramniwas Surjakhera reached Dhanda's residence in their respective vehicles.\n\nHowever, Dhanda later clarified that the JJP MLAs had come to meet his family to inquire about the well-being of his ailing nephew. Amid the political crisis in Haryana brought on by the withdrawal of support to the BJP government by three Independent MLAs, former deputy chief minister and JJP supremo, Dushyant Chautala, wrote to Governor Bandaru Dattatreya on Thursday, seeking his urgent intervention in ending the prevailing political deadlock and impose President's Rule if the incumbent was unable to prove its majority in the Assembly.\n\nEarlier in the day, the JJP chief renewed his offer of 'outside support' to the Congress in bringing down the incumbent BJP government. On May 7, the Haryana government suffered a big jolt after three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government, pushing the dispensation into a minority. The three MLAs were Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Charkhi Dadri.

During the floor test, if they can retain even 23 of their MLAs, it will be a big deal...

All 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state go to the polls on May 25. In the 90-member assembly, two seats are vacant, of which Karnal is going for by-elections on May 25.\n\nThe BJP has 40 members, and has the support of two independents -- Nayan Pal Rawat from Prithla and Rakesh Daulatabad from Badshahpur -- and Gopal Kanda of the Haryana Lokhit Party. That takes it to 43, two short of the majority mark of 45 in the assembly that currently has a strength of 88.\n\nThe Congress has 30 lawmakers, the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) has 10, and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has one. In addition, one independent legislator -- Balraj Kundu from Meham -- has not made his position clear.\n\nIf they all oppose the government, there will be 45 votes against the state government.\n\nINLD also wrote to the governor demanding a floor test or imposition of President's rule in the state\n\nQuestion marks hang over the JJP and its ability to command the support of all 10 of its legislators.\n\nAt least three MLAs - Barwala MLA Jogi Ram Sihag, Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam and Tohana MLA Devender Babli - are exploring ticket opportunities for the assembly elections and are in touch with the BJP leadership, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nAt a meeting at Khattar's in Panipat on Thursday, three JJP lawmakers -- Sihag, Babli and Narwana MLA Ram Niwas -- showed up.\n\nHooda also hinted at the possibility, and said that the JJP should parade all its 10 legislators before the governor.\n\n\"If the JJP parades all 10 MLAs before the governor, it will prove beyond doubt that the BJP does not have the numbers...The state government is in minority now,'' Hooda said, adding that the Congress was ready to parade its 30 lawmakers before the governor.\n\nDeputy Congress legislature party leader, Aftab Ahmed, and chief whip Bharat Bhushan Batra will lead the party delegation to meet Dattatreya possibly on Friday and present a memorandum demanding President's Rule in the state.\n\nCongress leaders said that party would never stake a claim to form the government with the JJP as it considers the latter a liability. \"The widespread resentment and protests being faced by the JJP leadership during the Lok Sabha poll campaign has made the JJP a liability. Why would we attempt to be seen as joining forces with the JJP, a party which is facing strong anti-incumbency in the state?'' a Congress leader asked, requesting anonymity.\n\nIn the middle of the turmoil, all eyes are on the governor. Through a series of judgments, including the Constitution bench rulings in SR Bommai (1994), Nebam Rebia (2016) and Subhash Desai (Maharashtra political crisis in 2023) cases, the Supreme Court has maintained that the governor has the authority to call for a floor test if it is clear from the materials at his disposal that a floor test is necessary to determine if the government is worthy of the House's confidence.\n\n\"In a situation where the governor has reasons to believe that the chief minister and his council of ministers have lost the confidence of the House, it is open to the governor to require the chief minister and his council of ministers to prove their majority in the House, by a floor test,\" the Nebam Rebia judgment held.\n\nFollowing these precedents, in Shivraj Singh Chouhan Vs Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Assembly (2020), the apex court further clarified that the power under Article 174 of the Constitution to summon the House and to prorogue it is one which is exercised by the governor on the aid and advice of the council of ministers.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The reason: Disinclination of the Congress to join hands with the JJP, a former BJP ally, and serious doubts on JJP leadership's ability to keep their flock together.\n\nThe Congress has a strength of 30 MLAs and the JJP has 10 MLAs in the House. Three Independent MLAs who were backing the BJP in the assembly on Tuesday announced the withdrawal of their support, triggering a political upheaval.\n\nLeader of Opposition in Haryana assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday told HT that if the JJP is not the B-team of the ruling BJP, it should immediately write to the governor articulating its opposition to the continuation of the minority government.\n\n\"If the JJP writes to the governor that they will not support the BJP in the assembly, a Congress delegation will meet the governor to seek a vote of no confidence against the BJP ministry. This government is now in minority,'' Hooda said.\n\nOn a question of whether the Congress would shake hands with the JJP to form the government, Hooda said that the President's rule should be imposed in the state and an election should be held.\n\nFormer BJP ally and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala while speaking to HT said that the Congress being the single largest opposition party in the House should make the first move and meet the governor. \"If the Leader of Opposition thinks that the BJP government needs to be brought down, the JJP will extend its support to bring it down,'' Dushyant said.\n\nPolitical experts said that Congress would not like to stake a claim to form the government with the support of the JJP as it considers the latter a liability. \"The resentment and protests being faced by the JJP leadership during the Lok Sabha poll campaign makes the JJP a liability. Why would the Congress attempt to be seen as joining forces with the JJP, a party which is facing strong anti-incumbency in the state?,'' said a Congress leader.\n\nProf Ashutosh Kumar, a political scientist at Panjab University, Chandigarh, said that the Opposition would be keen to weaken the government rather toppling it. The longer the BJP stays in chair, the higher would be the anti-incumbency sentiment against it. The focus would be on the forthcoming Assembly elections where there would be a bipolar contest, Prof Kumar said.\n\n\"Congress won't bring down the BJP government as its strategy would be to weaken the government in public perception. The Congress would like the present government to be in doldrums and pay the price of being the incumbent. It is a perception game. The withdrawal of the support of Independent MLAs to the ruling BJP is good optics for the Congress given its timing,'' he said.\n\nProf Kumar also said that Hooda being instrumental in getting the three Independents withdraw support from the BJP would strengthen his position in the faction-ridden Congress.\n\nThe assembly arithmetic\n\nPolitical analysts said that since one JJP MLA Jogi Ram Sihag has announced that he would campaign for the BJP and at least two JJP MLAs - Devender Babli and Ram Kumar Gautam who are exploring ticket opportunities for the assembly elections are in touch with the BJP leadership, a JJP whip to vote against the BJP during a floor test, may actually not yield desired results for the Opposition.\n\nAs of now, the BJP has 40 MLAs in the 88-member assembly. Of the 90 seats in the House, Karnal and Rania assembly seats have fallen vacant due to the resignation of former chief minister ML Khattar and independent MLA Ranjit Singh respectively.\n\nSo going by the 88 MLAs in the House, the BJP would need 45 to pass the floor test. The BJP with 40 MLAs can still count on the support of Independent MLA from Prithla and Badshahpur, Nayan Pal Rawat and Rakesh Daulatabad respectively besides Gopal Kanda of the Haryana Lokhit Party. However, even then it would get the BJP to the 43 mark, two short of a simple majority. However, if three JJP MLAs choose to abstain from voting, then the BJP would only need 43 votes to win the floor test out of 85 MLAs present and voting. \"It would be a huge letdown for the Congress if the BJP manages to win the floor test,'' said a party leader not willing to be named.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [],

Of the 48, two MLAs have resigned and are contesting the Lok Sabha elections. Three more MLAs have withdrawn support from the BJP and extended support to the Congress. So, this government practically is now of 42 or 43 MLAs and in a minority, as the half-way mark is 45,\" Hooda said.\n\n\"We expect the chief minister to resign on moral grounds immediately or the Governor should recommend imposition of President's Rule as the Lok Sabha election is in the works and in 10-12 days, people will cast votes,\" Hooda further said. He told News18 that it was important that the Governor must take the \"right constitutional steps\" in this regard. The BJP has been saying that a no-confidence motion cannot be brought within six months of the last one in February and the Haryana elections are anyways due later in October this year.\n\n\"These are technical grounds. They have lost the confidence of the people. They have lost the confidence of the MLAs. Right now, elections are in process in Haryana.

Either the chief minister proves his majority or submit his resignation. We will meet the governor and urge him to direct Nayab Singh Saini to prove his majority,\" he added.\n\n\"Now, Congress has to think whether they will take a step to bring down the BJP government,\" Chautala said.\n\nFormer chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the JJP was working as the BJP's B team and, therefore, Chautala should write to the governor and say they will oppose the BJP government, if a non-confidence motion is moved.\n\n\"The BJP government is in minority and 45 MLAs are presently against this government,\" Hooda said in Rohtak.\n\nFor his part, Saini - who took oath as chief minister in March, replacing his mentor Manohar Lal Khattar - asserted that his government was safe.\n\n\"The government is not in any trouble, it is working strongly,\" Saini told reporters in Sirsa.\n\n\"The Congress knows that it cannot fulfil the aspirations of people and misleads them. It tries to create a state of confusion that the (state) government is in minority. The government is in no trouble and it is functioning strongly,\" he added.\n\nThe latest chapter of the crisis that sparked off in March began on Tuesday after three independent lawmakers -- Randhir Golan from Pundri, Dharmpal Gonder from Nilokheri and Sombir Singh Sangwan from Dadri -- said they had decided to back Hooda of the Congress and written to governor Bandaru Dattatreya pulling their support from the Saini government.\n\n\"We are withdrawing support to the government. We are extending our support to the Congress,\" Gonder said.\n\nAssembly elections are scheduled in the state in October-November this year. All 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state go to the polls on May 25.\n\nIn the 90-member assembly, two seats are vacant, of which Karnal is going for by-elections on May 25.\n\nThe BJP has 40 members, and has the support of two independents -- Nayan Pal Rawat from Prithla and Rakesh Daulatabad from Badshahpur -- and Gopal Kanda of the Haryana Lokhit Party. That takes it to 43, two short of the majority mark of 45 in the assembly that currently has a strength of 88.\n\nThe Congress has 30 lawmakers, the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) has 10, and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has one. In addition, one independent legislator -- Balraj Kundu from Meham -- has not made his position clear.\n\nIf they all oppose the government, there will be 45 votes against the state government.\n\nINLD's lone lawmaker Abhay Singh Chautala said that either the government should prove it had a majority or else \"governor's rule should be imposed\".\n\nIn the middle of the uncertainty, all eyes are on the governor.\n\nThrough a series of judgments, including the Constitution bench rulings in SR Bommai (1994), Nebam Rebia (2016) and Subhash Desai (Maharashtra political crisis, in 2023) cases, the Supreme Court has maintained that the governor has the authority to call for a floor test if it is clear from the materials at his disposal that a floor test is necessary to determine if the government is worthy of the House's confidence.\n\n\"In a situation where the governor has reasons to believe that the chief minister and his council of ministers have lost the confidence of the House, it is open to the governor to require the chief minister and his council of ministers to prove their majority in the House, by a floor test,\" the Nebam Rebia judgment held.\n\nFollowing these precedents, in Shivraj Singh Chouhan Vs Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Assembly (2020), the apex court further clarified that the power under Article 174 of the Constitution to summon the House and to prorogue it is one which is exercised by the governor on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. \"But in a situation where the governor has reasons to believe that the council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, has lost the confidence of the House, constitutional propriety requires that the issue be resolved by calling for a floor test. The governor in calling for a floor test cannot be construed to have acted beyond the bounds of constitutional authority,\" it underlined.\n\nThe continuous existence of that confidence is crucial to the legitimacy and hence survival of the government, the court said in the 2020 judgment, adding it is a matter which can brook no delay since the authority of the government presided over by the chief minister depends on the council of ministers continuing to have the faith of the legislative body as a collective entity.\n\nSaini won the trust vote in a special session of the assembly on March 13, a day after being appointed in place of Khattar. The maximum period between two sessions of the assembly cannot exceed six months, which means that the governor will have to summon the House before September 13. At that time, Saini could face a no-confidence motion -- just weeks before assembly elections are scheduled in the state.\n\nHaryana Congress chief Udai Bhan said the party will write to the governor stating that the Saini government is in a minority and that it should be dismissed, the President's Rule imposed in the state and fresh polls announced.\n\n\"Likewise, the JJP should also write a letter that the government be dismissed. INLD's Abhay Singh Chautala and Independent MLA Balraj Kundu, who claim to be opposing the government, should also write similar letters to the governor,\" he added.\n\nBut the BJP indicated that it was in no mood to give up without a fight.\n\nIn Chandigarh, while replying to a question, Haryana speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that the Saini government won the trust vote on March 13.\"How can we say that the government is in a minority? It is intact and running as it was earlier,\" he told reporters.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here is why: While the Haryana assembly has 90 members, its two seats had fallen vacant diminishing its strength to 88 -- after the former chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and an independent MLA Ranjit Chautala resigned recently to contest the Lok Sabha seats of Karnal and Hisar, respectively.\n\nAt this point, BJP needs to have 45 members to win the no-trust motion. It has 40 MLAs of its own and the support of two independents, besides that of Haryana Lokhit Party's (HLP's) sole MLA Gopal Kanda bringing the numbers to 43.\n\nThe Congress, on the other hand, has 30 MLAs of its own; it also has the backing of four independents and the sole Indian National Lok Dal MLA Abhay Chautala raising the numbers to 35. In case support of JJP's 10 MLAs is forthcoming, it would add up to 45 which means a majority in the House of 88.\n\nBJP would need some JJP or independent MLAs to abstain to win\n\nBut, notably, the catch here is there are some JJP MLAs, who have been seen siding with the Congress or the BJP after the BJP dumped the JJP about two months ago. And if JJP issues a whip to vote against the BJP in an event of a no-trust move, the BJP would need some of the independents or JJP MLAs to abstain, so as to have a reduced number of MLAs present on the floor of the House, to win with even 43 legislators.\n\nMeanwhile, even though Speaker Gianchand Gupta has told newspersons that he had received no communication in writing about any MLAs withdrawing support or any no-trust move that might be in the offing, there was no threat to the BJP government.\n\nDushyant Chuatala has, meanwhile, asked all Opposition parties to unite and move the no-trust motion; he has further asked chief minister Nayab Saini to prove his government's majority on the floor of the House or resign.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopal_Goyal_Kanda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gopal Goyal Kanda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhay_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhay Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohar_Lal_Khattar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manohar Lal Khattar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisar_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hisar (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hisar (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-05/70914cbc-6ba7-4257-a9b3-c348ed92adf2/Dushyant_Chautala.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Congress will have to decide if they are going to take any steps to corner the current BJP government or not.\"\n\nHe further added, \"the governor has the power to order a floor test to see if the government has the strength and if it doesn't have the majority, immediately implement President's Rule in the state.\"\n\nBJP's estranged ally JJP is ready to support Congress-led opposition's bid to topple the Nayab Singh Saini government in Haryana, Chautala declared on Wednesday, simultaneously firing a warning to his MLA colleagues that defying a whip and siding with the saffron party would invite disqualification.\n\nEarlier this week, three Independent MLAs withdrew support from the BJP-led coalition, reducing its strength to 43 in what is effectively an 88-member assembly after the resignations last March by ex-CM Manohar Lal Khattar and Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala.\n\nMeanwhile, Saini insisted there was no threat to his govt and it would complete its tenure without a hitch. \"We weren't a minority government earlier and are not a minority now,\" he said in Sirsa.\n\nHaryana is due for state elections in October. Although the BJP government technically appears safe for now, three Independents withdrawing support could affect the party's prospects in the Lok Sabha poll.\n\nThe state will vote in the fifth phase on May 25, with BJP facing the challenge of retai- ning all 10 seats it won in 2019.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Congress demands dismissal, President's rule, and immediate polls. Hooda suggests CM resignation. Focus on assembly strength and potential no-confidence motion.As the BJP government in Haryana is facing questions on its majority in the state assembly after three independent MLAs withdrew support to the regime, opposition Congress on Wednesday demanded that the government be dismissed, President's rule be imposed, and assembly polls be held.\n\nWhile Congress is yet to signal any move to bring a no-confidence motion, its regional rival and estranged BJP ally Jannayak Janata Party (JPP) leader Dushyant Chautala said his party will support it if Congress brings a no-confidence motion but didn't elaborate why JPP is not bringing its own motion.\n\n\"The BJP government in Haryana has lost its majority after the withdrawal of support by some independent MLAs who have now extended their support to Congress. Since the state government has been reduced to a minority, it should be immediately sacked and President's rule be imposed in the state. The assembly elections should also be held immediately,\" Bhupinder Singh Hooda, leader of the opposition in the state assembly, told ET.\n\nAsked about chief minister Nayab Singh Saini still claiming majority support, Hooda said, \"The chief minister knows very well that his government is now in minority. The governor should advise him to tender his resignation. If the CM still insists his government has the majority, the Raj Bhavan should ask the CM to parade the supporting MLAs to show what he is claiming.\"\n\nOn whether Congress will move a no-trust motion, Hooda merely said it can be decided when the next assembly session will be convened.\n\nAmid the intensifying political battle and claims and counter claims, the focus is on the number game in the 90-member Haryana assembly whose current effective strength is 88. While BJP has 40 MLAs, Congress has 30 and JJP has 10. With the support of the two independent MLAs, the strength of the BJP-led government is now at 42, which technically marks a shortage of 3 from the majority mark of 45. What will be crucial is whether the opposition parties, especially JJP, will hold on to their MLAs amid BJP's all-out bid to find ways to make up for the loss .\n\nThe state government had overcome a Congress no-confidence motion in February. Some experts said the opposition party can propose another such motion only after a gap of six months. Some others argued that since there was a change of the chief minister after the last no-confidence motion, it is technically a new government which has not faced any no-confidence motion so far.\n\nThere is also a political question of whether the opposition should go all-out to eject a government which is at the fag end of its tenure and thus shift the focus away from incumbency issues.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Bhavan,_Chennai", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raj Bhavan, Chennai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109958236,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-6858,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He also put the ball in Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda's court, promising to support the Leader of Opposition (LoP) if he went for toppling the BJP government. In an interview with The Indian Express, Dushyant spoke on a range of issues related to the prevailing political crisis in the state. Excerpts:\n\nThe BJP is in turmoil, with Haryana's political scenario changing within the last 24 hours. Three Independent MLAs withdrew support from the ruling party and announced their support for the Opposition. It shows how weak the BJP has become. And it is because of the weakness of Chief Minister Nayab Saini. When I was part of the government with Manohar Lal Khattar, all Independent MLAs remained in support. We ran the government for about 4.5 years without any problem. If three MLAs withdraw support within 50 days of the new government's formation, it is a matter of serious concern. This government is in minority, and the CM should resign on moral grounds.\n\nWhy did you say you will support Congress if Bhupinder Hooda initiates steps to topple the government?\n\nI have said that I will support the Congress \"from outside\" if the Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda initiates steps to topple the government. He is the LoP and Congress is the largest Opposition party. He has to approach the Governor and move forward. As part of the Opposition, we'll stand with them. Today, this government does not have a majority, which is why the CM should resign. We shall also be writing to the Governor and do our bit, but Bhupinder Hooda has to initiate it. We'll be part of a collective Opposition and vote against the present government.\n\nBhupinder Hooda says if Dushyant is serious, he should first parade all his MLAs in front of the Governor. Would you do so?\n\nWhy should I do so? He (Hooda) is the LoP, he should initiate it. I'll write to the Governor and seek imposition of President's rule. If Hooda doesn't take the initiative, it will only be because of the ED and CBI cases he is facing.\n\nWhat are you doing about your own MLAs, who are canvassing for other parties - be it BJP or Congress?\n\nAll the MLAs are currently with the JJP. A whip was issued (during the March 13 no-confidence motion) and none of them voted, even though some were there in the House, who walked out and did not vote. JJP's MLAs can't violate the whip while being a member of the party. Three of my MLAs have been found on stage with other political parties. The party has issued them show cause notices for anti-party activities. We have their visuals, videos and posters too. They have to reply to the notices. There is a procedure that is followed in such matters. Neither of them has replied so far. Once they do, and if their replies are found unsatisfactory, we shall write to the Vidhan Sabha Speaker and seek their disqualification.\n\nIf they want to canvass or go to other political parties, they will first have to resign from the Vidhan Sabha. The party shall take whatever action is required on these MLAs. I again reiterate that if a floor test happens, the party (JJP) will issue a whip and I will show you all 10 JJP MLAs standing in a queue and voting against the present government. If you have contested and won on a party symbol, you will have to follow the party line. People who voted for you are watching. If you don't want to continue, you will have to resign from the Vidhan Sabha membership and move on. This Vidhan Sabha's tenure is till October 28, and all JJP MLAs will have to follow the party's line till then.\n\nWhy didn't your MLAs vote in the last no-confidence motion? Can another no-confidence motion be moved?\n\nThe previous no-confidence motion was moved against the previous government (led by Khattar). It lapsed when the new government was formed. Thus, a no-confidence motion can be moved against the current government. That day (March 13), when the motion was moved, there was a JJP rally. That's why the whip was issued, asking MLAs to be present at the rally. But I can assure you that if there is a floor test now, each of the JJP MLA shall vote according to the party whip, and ensure the government's fall.\n\nWhy do you say the CM is \"weak\"?\n\nAfter the first Cabinet meeting, the new CM said that he has prepared a 94-day action plan. He made it clear then that he is the CM for only 94 days. That was when it became clear how weak an administrator he is. I have been touring the state continuously. The crop is awaiting procurement. It has been since over 22 days when farmers haven't been paid their dues for their mustard crop, and 17 days for their wheat crop. It shows a failure of monitoring.\n\nWhy didn't any issue arise in the previous four years? We had created an automated system. Procurement was prompt, farmers used to get their payment within 48 hours. As of today, there are nearly 10 lakh wheat bags lying unattended at Uchana Mandi. This shows how poor the monitoring is.

He said there is no threat to the Nayab Singh Saini-led Government as it has a majority, adding that technically, the situation is the same as it was about two months ago in March when Saini had secured the majority in the Assembly after assuming power. Even today, BJP has 40 MLAs, Congress has 30 MLAs, 10 are of JJP, six are independent, and one MLA is of HLP and one MLA from INLD, he added. The Speaker said the Governor can summon the House and call for a floor test to prove whether the government has the numbers or not. Gupta pointed out that when the House is in session, it is the Speaker who can call for a floor test. Once the Governor's communication comes to the Speaker office, the decision will be taken as per the situation, he added. In an interview with 'The Pioneer', the Speaker talks about current political situations arising in the State in the aftermath of withdrawal of support to the BJP-led Government by three independent legislators.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of support to the Government by three independent MLAs, do you think, Nayab Singh Saini led Government in Haryana is in the minority?\n\nThrough newspapers, I learned that three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support to the Government. But I cannot comment on media reports on whether the Nayab Singh Saini-led Government has lost the majority or not. I have not received any official information regarding withdrawal of support to the government by three independent MLAs. Technically, the situation is the same as it was about two months ago in March 2024 when Saini had secured the majority in the Vidhan Sabha Assembly after assuming power.\n\nAfter three independent MLAs withdrew support to the Government, CM Saini -led Govt now has support of only 43 out of 88 MLAs. What is your role as a speaker now?\n\nI can't comment on who has numbers...who does not have numbers..., which parties support whom...; who supports whom... Only the CM can say. As no official information has been received regarding the withdrawal of support to the government so far so I can't say anything now. Only the Vidhan Sabha Assembly decides whether the current Government has majority or not. Moreover, as per rule, the Governor can summon the House and call for a floor test to prove whether the government has the numbers. Once the Governor's communication comes to us, the decision will be taken as per the situation. When the House is in session, it is the Speaker who can call for a floor test. But when the Assembly is not in session, the Governor's residuary powers under Article 163 allow him to call for a floor test.\n\nAccording to information, three MLAs have sent letters withdrawing their support from the government to the Governor. Have they sent such letters to you (Speaker)?\n\nThey may have sent such letters to the Governor. But I have not received any such letter so far.\n\nThe opposition says the Government has lost majority and either the Chief Minister should prove majority or resign on moral grounds. What would you say?\n\nIt is wrong to say that the Nayab Singh Saini led Government is in the minority. As per the latest information, the current government is in majority. The current situation is the same as it was two months ago in March when Saini had secured a majority in the House. A decision cannot be taken only on the opposition's demand.\n\nJannayak Janata Party has announced its support to the Congress if it takes steps to bring down Nayab Saini Government. What would you say?\n\nParties may claim anything. But when issues come to the Assembly, I will take action accordingly. As a Panchkula MLA, I would like to say that Senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda seems to be in a hurry. The Lok Sabha election is on. One should wait till the results are declared. I am confident that the BJP will perform exceptionally well in this election.\n\nIn Himachal Pradesh, three Independent MLAs had resigned but the speaker has not accepted their resignation yet. Your comment\n\nI cannot comment on the Himachal Pradesh issue. The Speaker can examine whether a resignation was by free will. In Haryana, after Independent MLA and Haryana Minister Ranjit Singh Chautala resigned, I gave him adequate time to explain whether the resignation was given by free will or not. Finally, I have made a decision regarding his resignation within 40 days.", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pioneer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manoj_kumar@dailypioneer.com", "name": "Manoj Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayab_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nayab Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislative_assemblies_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State legislative assemblies of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Chand_Gupta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gian Chand Gupta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Lok_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Lok Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranjit Singh Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhupinder Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchkula", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panchkula"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Panchkula"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Himachal Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The BJP has 40 MLAs and has support from two independents as well as Haryana Lokhit Party MLA Gopal Kanda.\n\nThe Congress has 30 MLAs in the Haryana Assembly and support from three independents. The Jannayak Janta Party has 10 members in the House.\n\nChautala said on Wednesday he would support the Congress if the party decided to topple the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state. \"It is now for Congress to think if it will take a step to topple the BJP government,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Congress MLA BB Batra said his party would also seek an appointment with the Haryana governor and demand a floor test, The Indian Express reported.\n\nThe developments come weeks before voting for the Lok Sabha election in Haryana, which is slated for May 25.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randhir_Singh_Gollen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randhir Singh Gollen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pundri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Lokhit_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Lokhit Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haryana Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/200599-tfkinsaopi-1715247882.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 1907, "textEnd": 1913}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It now has 43 MLAs in an 88-seat House and is two short of an absolute majority.\n\nIt is only proper, therefore, that it takes early steps to prove its majority on the floor of the House and assert its legitimacy before proceeding with matters of governance in the state.\n\nIronically, there won't be many who will beat their chests at the fact that the party that has been conducting Operation Lotus to topple elected governments in state after state is now getting a taste of its own medicine. Although it is perhaps several years since a BJP government is threatened by defections, it cannot afford to ignore the crisis altogether either, especially since its former ally, the Jannayak Janta Party with 10 MLAs, has declared that it will vote against the government in the Assembly.\n\nHaryana is due to have an Assembly election later this year. The BJP came to power for the first time in the state in 2014, winning 47 seats in a 90-member Assembly. Until then the political stage here had been shared by the Congress and various offshoots of the party once headed by Choudhary Devi Lal.\n\nThe BJP could not muster the numbers in the elections in 2019 but managed to hold on to power with the support of the JJP, led by Dushyant Chautala, the great-grandson of Devi Lal.\n\nRecently, the party effected a leadership change in the state. It replaced Manohar Lal Khattar who was its face since 2014 with Mr Saini.\n\nIt was part of the election management strategy of the BJP which calculated that the anti-incumbency feelings against the Khattar leadership could be neutralised by a largely unknown new face. Such a strategy has been seen to work in several other states.\n\nIt is not yet clear if the Saini government will sail through a confidence vote in the Assembly but the fact remains that the three Independents have chosen to break free from NDA. Which is headed by BJP that claims it will return to power in the Centre winning more than 400 of the Lok Sabha's 543 seats.\n\nDoes this gesture by the Independents have more to it than meets the eye? It is a question that the BJP must ask itself seriously.\n\nGrandstanding during election campaigns is not unusual but the Haryana development must cause the party to keep its ear to the ground.

Hitherto the flow of big and small political defectors had been in the other direction -- from opposition groups to the BJP.\n\nThere were reports of police chasing away Muslim voters from polling booths in a constituency in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. Elsewhere names of some voters had allegedly disappeared from the voters' list.\n\nIn the fray on Tuesday were 94 seats spread over 12 states, including all 26 seats in Gujarat where Mr Modi and his home minister cast their votes.\n\nThe day's contests included five seats in Bihar, four in West Bengal, 11 in Maharashtra, seven in Chhatt\u00adisgarh, 10 in Uttar Pradesh, 14 in Karnataka and nine in Madhya Pradesh, where Congress defector and BJP candidate Jyotiraditya Scindia was in the race. Of these states, Karnataka and West Bengal are ruled by the opposition. The fate of 285 seats is now sealed.\n\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI) ordered X, formerly Twitter, to take down an animated video posted by BJP Karnataka but avoided directly sending a notice to the BJP. The video features caricatures of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, advancing the party's recent messaging that the Congress is diverting funds and resources away from lower caste Hindus towards Muslims.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, the post had garnered over nine million views, and had not yet been taken down, reports said.\n\nThe Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee had on May 5 complained that the video violated the code of conduct, and Manoj Kumar Meena, the chief electoral officer of the state, subsequently ordered X to take the post down.\n\nIn a setback to the ruling BJP in Haryana amid the Lok Sabha election, three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support to the Nayab Singh Saini-led government in the state, reports said.\n\nThe three MLAs -- Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Gollen and Dharampal Gonder -- made the announcement at a press conference held in Rohtak in the presence of senior Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan.\n\nAfter their presser, Mr Hooda claimed that the Saini government had lost its majority. Their extension of support to the Congress, he claimed, proved that there is a wave for the party in the state and that \"we are poised to perform well in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls\".\n\nMr Saini took over state reins two months ago in March after the BJP broke off its alliance with the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party and dissolved the government under chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.\n\nOn the other hand, the Indian stock market has been experiencing strong bouts of volatility in recent sessions, leaving investors perplexed, reports said. Analysts have linked the fall to problems Mr Modi is facing in his third term bid.\n\nThe India VIX index, which measures volatility in the Indian stock market, has surged nearly 33pc in just four sessions in May so far, following a meagre 0.30pc rise in April and a significant 18pc fall in March.\n\nOn Tuesday, after opening higher, Indian stock market benchmarks, the Sensex and the Nifty 50 soon fell almost a per cent each on an all-round selloff. Both indices, however, pared losses and ended about half a percent lower each.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jawed_naqvi@dawn.com", "name":

Chautala has promised to back Congress if a no-trust motion against the BJP government is brought, but has not given notice for one. Congress is cautiously examining whether Chautala can keep his party's 10 MLAs united or if a section is available to BJP. BJP inducting defectors presents a new challenge for its leaders, as they may only have a chance in the assembly elections. Game for Haryana Throne has Just Begun\n\nBJP's estranged ally in Haryana, Dushyant Chautala-led JJP, has been on a verbal overdrive ever since three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Saini government. He has promised to back turf-rival Congress if the latter brings a no-trust motion against the BJP government, but did not say why JJP won't bring it itself. Also, Chautala's party is yet to give notice for a no-trust motion. While Congress is looking for an opening, it is treading cautiously as political circles are already debating whether Chautala can keep his party's 10 MLAs united or whether a section of them is available to BJP in the event of a number crunch. A little bird says another section of JJP MLAs is talking to Congress for a pre-assembly poll deal.\n\nDefectors More Than Eager to Prove a Point\n\nWith BJP inducting defectors, a new challenge has cropped up for its leaders. As ticket distribution for Lok Sabha elections is over, some of the new faces are aware that they will get a chance only in the assembly elections. Still, many of them want to be assigned some responsibility. A few of the inductees were panelists and spokespersons in their previous parties and are now actively trying to convince their new bosses that they should be sent on TV debates. BJP is wary of the obvious criticism from the public that just a few days ago these politicians were attacking the saffron party and its policies.\n\nAfterall, it's a Political League\n\nMaharashtra's Opposition parties have turned alleged shifting of industries to Gujarat a major campaign issue, with Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat taking this to a different level. He pointed out how Hardik Pandya, a Gujarati and the erstwhile captain of Gujarat Titans, was made captain of Mumbai Indians, replacing Rohit Sharma, a Mumbaikar. Opinion in Congress is divided about his claim.

If it does not resign, then the Governor should take cognizance of the matter and impose President's rule in Haryana and conduct elections.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannayak_Janta_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannayak Janta Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushyant_Chautala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dushyant Chautala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandaru_Dattatreya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandaru Dattatreya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohtak_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohtak Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepender_Singh_Hooda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepender Singh Hooda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President's rule"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/05/09/41eadcc68ebf5517c3ecb2a6f189a24a1715241986708566_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546162", "eventUri": "eng-9546162", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

He was among the seven legislators, who extended support to Manohar Lal Khattar and soon he was appointed as chairman of Haryana forest development corporation.\n\nIn Kaithal, Randhir Gollen contested the election as an Independent from Pundri, after losing the last election on a BJP ticket.\n\nOut of 1,36,303 votes, Gollen polled 41,008 votes (31%) in his favour, followed by Congress' Satbir Bhana and BJP's Ved Pal Advocate was pushed to third. There was a margin of over 20,000 votes between Gollen and Ved Pal.\n\nSimilarly, Sombir Sangwan also managed to push Dangal girl Babita Kumari Phogat, representing the BJP, to third position. Of 1,25,909 votes polled, Sangwan bagged 43,849 (35%), while Phogat was limited to just 24,786 (20%).\n\nConstituency Profile\n\nKarnal Lok Sabha has nine assembly segments - Indri (BJP), Nilokheri (Ind), Karnal (BJP), Gharounda (BJP), Assandh (INC), Panipat City (BJP), Panipat Rural (BJP), Israna (INC) and Samalkha (INC). Here, BJP has five MLAs and Congress have three and one Independent--Gonder.\n\nOn the seat that is considered Punjabi dominant, Khattar will be taking on Congress' Divyanshu Budhiraja, both from the same community.\n\nIn Kurukshetra constituency, BJP MLAs represent Thanesar (Subhash Sudha), Pehowa (Sandeep Singh), Kalayat (Kamlesh Dhanda) and Kaithal (Leela Ram), while its former ally JJP won Shahbad (Ram Karan) and Guhla (Ishwar Singh), Congress's Bishan Lal Saini is MLA from Radaur and Mewa Singh from Ladwa.\n\nWith Gollen's decision, the opposition could have the support of five MLAs. Sons of both JJP legislators - Ram Karan and Ishwar Singh -- recently joined the Congress.\n\nThe seat currently held by chief minister Nayab Saini has nearly 22% of the OBC population with considerable voters from Jat, followed by Punjabi and Baniya communities.\n\nBJP has fielded two-time MP from the seat Naveen Jindal, AAP's state president Sushil Gupta is INDIA bloc's candidate, while INLD's lone MLA Abhay Chautala is also testing waters this time.\n\nOn Bhiwani-Mahendragarh Lok Sabha seat, there are four Assembly segments in Mahendergarh district - Mahendergarh (INC), Ateli (BJP), Narnaul (BJP), Nangal Chaudhary (BJP), three in Bhiwani -- Bhiwani (BJP), Tosham (INC) and Loharu (BJP) besides two legislative constituencies of Charkhi Dadri district -- Badhra (JJP) and Dadri (IND).\n\nBJP that represents five of nine assembly segments, has reposed confidence in two-time MP Dharambir Singh, while Congress' Mahendergarh MLA is the Lok Sabha nominee from the seat.",

Some people may have problems, but the state government has no problems and the people of the state will not let the Congress party fulfil its wishes. They rely on corruption while we rely on development,\" the Chief Minister said.\n\nThe Haryana government suffered a jolt on Tuesday when three independent MLAs withdrew support from the Nayab Saini government pushing the government into a minority. However, the BJP appears confident of retaining power with former Chief Minister Manhora Lal Khattar claiming that leaders of the Congress and the JJP were in touch with the BJP.\n\n\"This political battle will go long, many people are in touch with us, be it from Congress or JJP. They should take care of their home first... We will make sure that in the next election (of state assembly), we get a full majority so that such situations don't arise,\" the former Haryana CM said.\n\nMeanwhile, at his press conference, Haryana CM Nayab Saini targeted the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi accusing them of spreading confusion and said 'Ye jooth ka silsila ab nahi chalega, Ab Modi Ji ki guarantee chalegi.'\n\nStepping up his attacks on Rahul Gandhi, Nayab Singh Saini said, \"He (Rahul Gandhi) says that will end poverty in one click. He should first take a look at the work done by his ancestors.\" Elaborating further, the Haryana Chief Minister claimed, \"In the 1970s, Indira Gandhi had said that they would remove poverty but it still hasn't been removed.\"\n\nCriticising Rahul Gandhi for spreading confusion, Saini said, \"Rahul Gandhi also told another lie that he will transfer one lakh in the accounts of the poor. If one does the calculation, it amounts to \u20b950 lakh crore. The country's budget is \u20b946 lakh crore. The country wants to ask where will he bring the money from. They (Congress party and Rahul Gandhi) are spreading confusion by telling such lies.\"\n\nHe added further, \"Today, the people have understood the Congress and will not believe them. 'Ye jooth ka silsila ab nahi chalega, Ab Modi Ji ki guarantee chalegi.' (the series of lies will not work now, only PM Modi's guarantees will work).\"\n\nLauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, \"PM Narendra Modi transferred \u20b93.5 lakh crore to the accounts of the farmers under the PM Kisan Samman Nisdhi... He gave Ayushman Cards to the poor worth \u20b95 lakh...\"\n\nSpeaking at the press conference, Nayab Singh Saini also said, \"We will make PM Narendra Modi Prime Minister for the third time. Congress lies to us. It did not do any work in its ruling tenure... PM Modi has empowered women, strengthened farmers and gained the trust of youth in the last 10 years. Now, Congress has no issues.

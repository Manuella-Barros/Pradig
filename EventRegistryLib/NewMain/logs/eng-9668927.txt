It also found she breached internal policies by retaliating against complainants and failing to maintain confidentiality about the matter.\n\nArchibald continues to deny those allegations, and her supporters maintain she was removed from the job for trying to challenge the organization's status quo.\n\nThe Assembly of First Nations said it won't comment until the matter is resolved through a legal process.\n\nThe organization works as an advocacy body for some 630 First Nations chiefs across Canada, and is largely funded by the federal government, which relies on the AFN for help to consult on bills that will affect First Nations Peoples and communities.\n\nAsked about the forensic audit, Anandasangaree said there are accountability mechanisms built into funding agreements with the federal government, \"and the AFN is no different.\"\n\nBut the way the federal government approaches its relationship with the assembly is built on the \"element of trust,\" he said.\n\n\"The primary conversation is not about accountability. The primary focus is about the relationship and we are very confident that relationship is strong.\"\n\nAnandasangaree said previous governments had policies that required First Nations to release audited financial statements about salaries and expenses, saying their entire preoccupation was on accountability.\n\n\"Which really says, 'We don't trust our partners, and therefore, every dollar that goes out, we want to make sure that the bar of accountability is so high that it is virtually impossible to meet,'\" he said.\n\n\"So in order for us to reset the relationship and go toward true partnership, we do need to trust each other and the processes that we have within our department.\"\n\nAt the AFN's upcoming annual general assembly in July, a plenary is scheduled on the draft agenda about the audited financial statements.\n\nAnother is scheduled for a March 2022 resolution passed by chiefs that called for an investigation and audit of the Assembly of First Nations' financial and management policies.\n\nThat resolution called for a review of the assembly's financial policies and practices, to review conflicts of interest with the national chief's office, the executive committee and the secretariat, and to make recommendations to ensure greater transparency and accountability.\n\nIt also called for the assembly to hire an independent auditor to review the past 10 years of financial activity, \"with particular attention to recent AFN salary payouts and contracts,\" and to conduct a digital investigation into alleged breaches of communication.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

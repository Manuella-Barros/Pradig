While workers were able to secure favorable contracts with many Las Vegas Strip casino hotels last year, members on Friday are set to strike at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, where employees have been working without a contract since the agreement expired last year.\n\nBy Katie Ann McCarver (contact)\n\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 | 5:35 p.m.\n\nHundreds of Las Vegas hospitality workers are scheduled to participate in the Culinary Union's first official strike in more than two decades, as the organization continues to negotiate with Virgin Hotels Las Vegas for a new five-year contract.\n\nThe strike will kick off with a complete work stoppage and 24-hour picket lines Friday at 5 a.m., and lasting until Sunday at 4:59 a.m., the union announced Wednesday evening. It's the first strike by the Culinary and Bartenders Unions at the Virgin Hotels property in Las Vegas. The two sides are scheduled to be back at the negotiating table May 14, according to a release.\n\n\"When there is an active picket line outside of a casino, there is a labor dispute, and so the Culinary Union is already urging customers and community allies to not cross the picket line at the Virgin Las Vegas and will be encouraging visitors to cancel their reservation, check out of the property, and choose a union accommodation,\" the release said.\n\nUnion members from properties on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown are slated to join the hundreds of Virgin guest-room attendants, food servers, bartenders and other hospitality workers participating in the Culinary Union's first strike in 22 years, per the release.\n\nThe last strike in 2002 lasted for 10 days and won workers a strong contract at the Golden Gate, the release said.\n\nThe union has amassed supplies and materials for \"24/7 strike stations,\" for this weekend's strike, which the release said will impact all major areas of operations at Virgin, from housekeeping to food and beverage, including unionized restaurants like Casa Calavera, The Shag Room and more, the release said.\n\n\"We are fighting for a new union contract that includes better wages, less workload, and for the same rights that every other casino has on the Strip,\" Alain Lopez, a food server at Virgin and Culinary Union member, said in the release. \"We are going on strike at the Virgin Las Vegas to make sure that one job should be enough!\"\n\nIt's been almost a year since union workers' contract expired at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, said Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union, in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"Workers at Virgin Las Vegas deserve fair wage increases and they are organized and ready to strike for it,\" Pappageorge said in the release. \"As Virgin Las Vegas workers go on strike ... the Culinary Union has their back every step of the way and we will win.\"\n\nFriday's strike will come on the heels of the Culinary and Bartenders Unions voting to authorize a citywide strike in September 2023, before securing historic contracts for tens of thousands of workers with major players on the Strip -- including Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts.\n\nSince then, hospitality workers have also locked down new contracts at a slew of downtown and independent properties, including the Golden Nugget, the Rio, the El Cortez and more, according to the Culinary Union website.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visited Culinary Union headquarters this year to commend the organization for what it's won for Las Vegas hospitality workers.\n\nAccording to Wednesday's release, new Culinary contracts at resorts around Las Vegas include the union's largest-ever wage increase, reduced workloads, job safety and technology protections and more.\n\n\"I'm ready to strike because I'm fighting for me, my family, and my co-workers,\" Isabel Gonzalez, a guest-room attendant at Virgin and a Culinary Union member of 14 years, said in a statement. \"I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win ... great wage increases, health care, and job security for my family. My co-workers and I ... are united to win higher wages and to get a contract so that one job should be enough.\"\n\nContract negotiations for Virgin are all that remain, the release said Wednesday.\n\n\"Nothing in our nine decades has been easily won and our good jobs weren't simply handed to us,\" Pappageorge said in a statement. \"We made hospitality jobs in Las Vegas family-sustaining jobs with decades of sacrifice and strength, and we will continue to win what we deserve -- a great union job with fair wages, job security, and the best health care benefits so that Virgin Las Vegas workers can continue to provide for their families.\"", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Ultimately, the union fights for better working conditions for the 700 hospitality workers at Virgin Las Vegas.\n\nThe call for the strike marks a historic moment as the property has never been subject to a strike from the Culinary and Bartenders Union before. The strike is planned to start at 5 AM on Friday, May 10 and continue through Sunday, May 12 at 4:59 AM.\n\nAlthough the union had organized a main table negotiation with Virgin Las Vegas on Tuesday, at the time of writing, there's no information suggesting that the discussions had a positive outcome. During the time of the strike, the union urges \"the community and customers to support workers and to not patronize or cross picketing happening on strike lines.\"\n\nThe negotiations and potential strike come at a time when workers at Virgin Hotel Las Vegas expect a new 5-year union contract. With the strike, the Culinary Union seeks to ensure better working conditions for the venue's employees. If the strike takes place as planned, it is expected to impact all areas of the venue's operations, including departments such as food and beverage, housekeeping and even restaurants. Unionized restaurants at Virgin Las Vegas include The Bar at Commons Club, Juice Bar, Casa Calavera, Funny Library Coffee Shop, The Shag Room and The Kitchen at Commons Club.\n\nTed Pappageorge, the Culinary Union's secretary-treasurer, spoke about the expired contract for the workers at Virgin Las Vegas. He said that after the contract expired on June 1, 2023, it has now been nearly a year and those employees still do not have a new contract in place. Pappageorge encouraged community members and customers not to cross the strike line and show support for the employees who are on strike.\n\nAdditionally, the secretary-treasurer said that Virgin Las Vegas employees deserve fair wages and better job security and they are ready to go on a strike to achieve this goal. \"As Virgin Las Vegas workers go on strike on Friday, May 10th, the Culinary Union has their back every step of the way and we will win,\" added Pappageorge.\n\n\"It's been nearly one year since the contract at Virgin Las Vegas expired on June 1, 2023 and workers are still working without a contract, that's why the Culinary Union has called for a 48-hour strike at the Virgin Las Vegas and urge the community and customers to not cross the strike line.\"\n\nHe spoke about the Culinary Union's extensive efforts over nearly nine decades that helped ensure the well-being and potential growth of workers across Nevada.

The decision to strike comes amidst ongoing negotiations for a five-year union contract, with workers at the Virgin Las Vegas property currently operating without a contract since its expiration on June 1, 2023.\n\nA spokesperson for Culinary Workers Union Local 226 shared a statement on Wednesday evening, which reads: \"The Culinary Union is already urging customers and community allies to not cross the picket line at the Virgin Las Vegas and will be encouraging visitors to cancel their reservation, check out of the property, and choose a union accommodation.\n\n\"Last year, members of the Culinary and Bartenders Unions voted to authorize a citywide strike after tens of thousands of hospitality workers packed the Thomas and Mack Center in September 2023 to cast their votes. Contracts for over 50,000 workers have since been settled and workers have won the best contract ever. Contract negotiations for one casino property remain: The Virgin Las Vegas contract which expired June 1, 2023, and the extension was terminated.\"\n\nVirgin Hotels representatives did not immediately respond to local media requests for comment on the impending strike action. However, Virgin President Cliff Atkinson had earlier expressed confidence in the ongoing negotiations with the Culinary Union, assuring that recent changes to casino operations would not impact hospitality workers and affirming the resort's commitment to bargaining in good faith.\n\nIf the strike proceeds as planned, it will affect various facets of operations at the off-Strip resort, impacting guest room attendants, cocktail and food servers, porters, bellmen, cooks, bartenders, laundry, and kitchen workers.

This will be the first Culinary Union strike in 22 years -- the last strike occurred in 2002 at the Golden Gate in Downtown Las Vegas, and lasted for 10 days before the union was able to secure a new contract. This strike will affect areas of operation across the hotel, including its housekeeping, food and beverage departments, and the unionized restaurants including Casa Calavera, Funny Library Coffee Shop, Juice Bar, the Bar at Commons Club, the Kitchen at Commons Club, and the Shag Room. To support the workers during the strike, the Culinary Union has amassed an $11 million strike fund.\n\nThe last collective bargaining agreement at Virgin Hotels expired on June 1, 2023, and since then, the union has not been able to secure a new contract. While many of the conditions of the agreement remain in effect after expiration, including wages and benefit protections, the no-strike provisions are no longer valid. For the new contract, the union aims to secure wage increases, protections around new technology replacing workers, an increased commitment to worker safety, adjustments to daily room cleaning requirements for housekeepers, and more. The original strike deadline for Virgin Hotels, along with 28 other properties, was February 5, 2024.\n\nAt a press briefing held Thursday, May 9, Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer for Culinary Union, said that negotiations with the other properties were successful and ended in new contracts, with Virgin Hotels being the last outstanding hotel. After the February deadline passed, the union, along with the workers on the bargaining committee, decided to continue its negotiations with Virgin Hotels. \"Unfortunately, those discussions have been unfruitful and the negotiating committee has made a decision to go on strike tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.\" Pappageorge said.\n\nIn response to the Culinary Union's strike announcement, Virgin Hotels issued a press release alleging that the union is not bargaining in good faith. The release alleges that hotel management has put forward \"sincere efforts to meet and negotiate,\" including offering mediation, but has not been able to come to an agreement with the union. According to the release, Virgin Hotels has also decided to take legal action by filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nAt the press briefing, Pappageorge confirmed that the Culinary and Bar Unions have no plans to meet with the hotel leadership in advance of the strike. \"We don't need a mediator to explain to workers the value of zero,\" Pappageorge said. \"Workers are not stupid. They're very smart and it's just another slap in the face from this company.\"\n\nThis negotiation marks the second time the Culinary Union is heading to the bargaining table with Virgin Hotels for a new contract. The last negotiation ended with the hotel agreeing to pay Strip standards, but, according to Pappageorge, the cost of living has increased significantly in Las Vegas -- the union agreeing to ratify the new contract is contingent upon securing wage increases.\n\n\"This strike is an economic strike,\" Pappageorge told reporters in attendance at the briefing. He further alleged the hotel had invested in renovations while not offering raises to its employees.\n\nThe last major move toward a strike from the Culinary and Bartenders unions happened in November 2023. At the time, 35,000 workers were set to go on strike, but the action was called off after the union came to agreements with MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment, and Wynn Resorts.\n\nThe next bargaining session between the Culinary Union and Virgin Hotels is set for Tuesday, May 14.", "source": {"uri": "vegas.eater.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eater Vegas"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Hotels", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Hotels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Hotels_Las_Vegas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Hotels Las Vegas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Picketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_Workers_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culinary Workers Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Las Vegas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caesars Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unfair labor practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Labor Relations Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn_Resorts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wynn Resorts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XA54zt-rUrLbHj-DsQBCqn5Lo-U=/0x96:1214x703/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25071626/Screen_Shot_2023_11_09_at_11.31.37_AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553477", "eventUri": "eng-9553477", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 153, "textEnd": 159}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 181, "textEnd": 187}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1630, "textEnd": 1635}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 3992, "textEnd": 3998}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

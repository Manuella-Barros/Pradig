So I looked at all the old kinds of Barbie and Fashion Makeover and cooking strategy games that I used to play for hours, and got influenced by those backing track vibes.\u201d For Guselle, this was a dream job; a chance to embrace all sorts of different, distinct types of music and performance at once. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in so many different genres; I would never be able to pick just one,\u201d Guselle said. \u201cWhen I went to the University of Toronto and got my bachelor\u2019s in classical music \u2026 I chose that on purpose because I knew that getting a classical, theoretical base was going to be my best bet to be able to explore many different genres.\u201d And for SUM Theatre artistic director and The Reel Whirled co-director Mac Dawson, Guselle took the \u201ctall task\u201d of creating a \u201990s, digital soundscape that would resonate for audiences of all ages, and brought the narrative to new heights.", "summary": "Guselle is the music director, composer and arranger for The Reel Whirled, SUM Theatre's original Theatre in the Park play for 2024.", "url": "https://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/local-arts/from-classical-vocals-to-sleek-and-shiny-theatrics-oli-guselle-revels-in-genres-and-musical-storytelling", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/thestarphoenix/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0514-news-theatre-in-the-park-48-1.jpg", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LluApCbr-oXH5r7au.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:00:56", "author": "Julia Peterson", "authors": ["Julia Peterson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.624}

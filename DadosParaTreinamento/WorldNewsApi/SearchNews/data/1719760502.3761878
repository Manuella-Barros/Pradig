The conversation ranges from early Detroit boom bap and West Coast gangsta to who\u2019s on tour, and who\u2019s dropped what. Over the last few months NASAAN has been on an impressive press run to promote his album ERROR 404, slated for a May 31 release, including appearances on Way Up with Angela Yee, Ebro in the Morning, and The Joe Budden Podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty surreal, because I\u2019m such a hip-hop nerd, like a rap nerd,\u201d he says. \u201cI go to sleep watching these people so being on their platforms almost felt like breaking a fourth wall in a way. I was super nervous.\u201d NASSAN is dressed in a button-down white shirt, black tie, shorts, and a caramel-colored sweater. He has on black Prada shoes, and a diamond-encrusted grill fills his mouth while 3 star shaped stickers are spread over his face. \u201cI\u2019m taking on this character, a young guy who wants to be a part of this tech company ERROR 404,\u201d he says. \u201cThe insignia of those who have been accepted into the company is the brown cardigan. The stickers represent being employee of the month at the company.\u201d NASAAN is as creative an emcee as you\u2019ll ever meet, but he\u2019s not just a rapper. His YouTube channel is full of comedic skits, abstract content, and witty freestyles \u2014 just think Childish Gambino meets Joyner Lucas. But he\u2019s also the 21-year-old son of legendary emcee DeShaun \u201cBig Proof\u201d Holton. For those outside, Detroit Proof was simply the frontman to hip-hop group D-12, a fierce battle rapper, and the Robin to Eminem\u2019s Batman. But for Detroiters, Proof was one of the best to ever step behind the mic, the quintessential lynchpin within Detroit hip-hop. From the Goon Squad to 5-Ela, from the Hip Hop Shop to the Shelter at Saint Andrew\u2019s, Proof was an ambassador of Detroit hip-hop who helped lead it to its most significant wave of global notoriety. He died April 11, 2006 when NASAAN was 7 years old. \u201cAfter he passed we moved down south,\u201d NASAAN says. \u201cWe moved to Florida for a year or two and then moved to Atlanta because my grandma stayed there. So I pretty much grew up in Atlanta.\u201d The move was an economic and a cultural shift. NASAAN says his family experienced financial hardships after his father died and his appreciation of hip-hop was influenced by Atlanta\u2019s evolving trap music scene. \u201cMy stepfather was Jeezy's bodyguard so that's all I would listen to,\u201d NASAAN adds. \u201cIt molded my taste and my palette to trap music and the Atlanta sound in general.\u201d Along with Atlanta trap music, the mid-2000s were very diverse years for hip-hop. Detroiters Big Sean and DeJ Loaf were making their mark while seasoned veterans like Jay-Z and Pusha T were still dropping music, and Chicago drill had become the newest sound to take hip-hop by storm. \u201cThe first person I ever \u2018stanned\u2019 in my life was Chief Keef,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he had a crazy grip on my generation, period. I remember wearing a big-ass fake designer belt my mom had bought me from the flea market to try and embody what he had going on,\u201d he adds through a laugh. NASAAN says he started actively writing rhymes in 8th grade and by 9th grade he was recording songs daily (although he only released one song), and was a student of the craft who was more interested in quality over quantity. \u201cI used to [read] Complex every day and they had this list of best albums of every year by rappers,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I just went through it and studied it all \u2026 I was so mesmerized.\u201d In 2017, a 16-year-old NASAAN entered the Fresh Empire\u2019s The New Wave Competition. The contest featured six emcees, three rounds, and included a DJ and live band. NASAAN finished second to Baltimore rapper Lil Key, but his notoriety skyrocketed. It appeared that NASAAN\u2019s proverbial breakout moment had arrived. \u201cSway hosted it. Marshall and Big Sean posted me and it got super big,\u201d he says. \u201cI got 50,000 [Instagram] followers overnight.\u201d However, what appeared to be a big step forward was used to take a step back. NASAAN felt he wasn\u2019t ready for the adulation as he wasn\u2019t giving the public the best representation of who he was as an artist. \u201cWhen that happed I kind of got scared because all these eyes were on me and I didn\u2019t wanna fuck up,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make the wrong move. I didn\u2019t know myself as an artist. I felt like I had to do this rappity rap shit because of the legacy and what people associated me with.\u201d NASAAN retreated back to his bat cave where he continued to iron out his style, his approach, and grow his lyricist super powers. About a year later he popped up on the radar of Eminem\u2019s manager Paul Rosenberg, who had become chairman and CEO of Def Jam Recordings in 2018. \u201cWhile I was in high school he caught wind of me because I would do features with someone who was a fan of me in London,\u201d NASSAN says. \u201cHis name is Kid Bookie, a very great rapper. He had a lot of motion going on overseas.\u201d Rosenberg signed NASAAN to Def Jam of that same year and the union seemed to be a match made in hip-hop heaven. What could be more perfect that Proof\u2019s son inking a record deal with Paul Rosenberg and Def Jam, the most historic hip-hop label ever? NASAAN released a five-song EP Kiss of Karma highlighted by the creative single \u201cBen/Frank,\u201d though it would be NASAAN\u2019s only release through Def Jam as he left the label after Roseberg stepped down in 2020. \u201cEverybody left,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t even think staying was an option.\u201d NASSAN didn\u2019t stay unsigned for too long, however. He had already been on the radar of Koehler, who founded Assemble Sound in 2015 and had inked a joint venture with Atlantic Records in 2021. \u201cDrew [Drialo] told me about NASAAN before he signed to Def Jam and was like, \u2018Just keep your eye on him,\u2019 and he told me about his background,\u201d Koehler says. Koehler did just that. He kept up with NASAAN\u2019s content and drops. About a year after NASAAN parted ways with Def Jam he released the single \u201cR.I.P. FRESH\u201d in January of 2022 and Koehler was so impressed that he knew it was time to reach out to him. \u201cAfter he dropped \u2018R.I.P. Fresh,\u2019 that\u2019s when I saw art that felt reflective of the artist,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the first video he directed and put out himself.\u201d After several months of conversations Koehler signed NASAAN to a record deal on Assemble Sound in August 2022. In dramatic fashion NASAAN signed the contract while riding the Magnum XL-200 roller coaster with Koehler at Cedar Point. He was the first artist to officially sign to the imprint. Koehler calls him \u201cthe one,\u201d and firmly believes that NASAAN has the skill set to become a world renowned hip-hop artist. \u201cHe could be a superstar,\u201d Koehler says. \u201cHe has the energy that could fill an arena and I say that because of his charisma, his lyricism, which is both technically good and also widely creative. It embodies a very unique perspective.\u201d NASAAN incorporates a variety of tools to create music. He utilizes voice notes and voice memos to store ideas for later dates, and punches in his rhymes but also writes his bars down when he wants to evoke certain feelings and articulate certain thoughts. In February of this year NASAAN set the hip-hop sound waves a blaze with a mesmerizing \u201cOn The Radar\u201d freestyle. \u201cThat freestyle, it was so much pressure,\u201d he says shaking his head. \u201cI was in L.A., I had to fly back and do it that same morning.\u201d That was followed up a month later with the bass-heavy \u201cCullinan Gang\u201d which featured the melodic trap vocals of one of Detroit\u2019s favorite emcees, Icewear Vezzo. \u201cVezzo had came up to the studio one day and we was talking, kicking it \u2026 We linked up at the 50 cent show, he was showing mad love,\u201d he says. NASAAN\u2019s most recent release is \u201cGoated\u201d featuring Royce da 5\u20199\u201d. Within the video for the single NASAAN recreates the MTV News freestyle session between his father and Eminem. The song was released on April 11, eighteen years to the day that Proof passed away. NASSAN has also partnered with ESPN with a licensing deal for \u201cGoated'' to be featured during the 2024 NBA playoffs. \u201cIt was in tribute to my father,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last line right before the first hook is and my daddy like, boy don\u2019t blow my assist.\u2019 I feel like he laid all this out for me man and I just gotta lay it up.\u201d For NASAAN the bond he\u2019s been able to forge with Eminem and Royce is priceless. They both were his father\u2019s friends and fellow emcees. The waters of the music business can get nasty and complicated, so having access to veterans that have already reached their GOAT status is a game changer. \u201cRoyce is like super close to me,\u201d NASSAN says. \u201cHe\u2019s an OG, I damn near see him everyday. He has nothing but game to give me. I\u2019ve learned so much \u2026 And Marshall is like this big presence and inspiration. I take from him artistically, subconsciously, like without even trying. Just someone I can touch and talk to because he\u2019s somewhere I want to be one day.\u201d This is the most comfortable NASAAN has ever been in his own skin and he feels it will show in his body of work. NASAAN is not the first emcee who has a father known for being a top-tier rapper. Lil Blade (Blade Icewood), Chris Rivers (Big Pun), are just two of the many emcees to follow in the famous father\u2019s footsteps. With NASAAN, he\u2019s found a way to embrace his father\u2019s legacy without feeling threatened by it, and he\u2019s no longer worried about people feeling like he\u2019s undeserving of his opportunities. \u201cMy father\u2019s legacy was something I ran from and shied from for so long,\u201d he says. \u201cFor my own reasons, I didn\u2019t want people to discredit me. I took pride in doing the work, I didn't want people to take that from me. I didn\u2019t want people to think I got shit handed to me or wanna be my friend for different reasons.\u201d He also has a foot in every aspect of ERROR 404. He mapped out and co-directed all of his music videos, the sequencing of songs on the project, and says he\u2019s confident that he\u2019s developed the version of his craft that he wants to give the world. \u201cAt Def Jam I was trying to be everything I was influenced by versus using my influences to paint me as the picture,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just grown as a person and a human first \u2026 I always say this project to me is my \u2018what\u2019 and not my \u2018who.\u2019 It\u2019s what I am sonically. It\u2019s the fun shit, it\u2019s the off the wall randomness, it\u2019s all those things when you think of NASSAN.\u201d", "summary": "<img src=\"https://media2.metrotimes.com/metrotimes/imager/u/magnum/36397647/music-nasaan-23-web.jpg?cb=1716983945\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" />\n      Rapper NASAAN, his girlfriend Tiva Fox, and CEO of Assemble Sound Garret Koehler are sitting in a semi circle talking about all things hip-hop.

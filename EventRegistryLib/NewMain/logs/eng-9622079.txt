(AP) - After years of stumbles and delays, Boeing has finally launched astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA.\n\nIt\u00b4s the first flight of Boeing\u00b4s Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station.\n\nNASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of empty test flights.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing\u00b4s early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner planes.\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams, left, and Butch Wilmore pose for a photo after leaving the operations and checkout building for a trip to launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. The two astronauts are scheduled to liftoff later today on the Boeing Starliner capsule for a trip to the international space station. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing\u00b4s two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn\u00b4t reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed. Wednesday's launch was the third try with astronauts; two earlier countdowns were scuttled by rocket-related issues.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts.\n\nStarliner blasted off on United Launch Alliance\u00b4s Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's the first time astronauts have ridden an Atlas since NASA\u00b4s Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Now 62 years later, Wednesday's launch was the 100th for the top-of-the-line Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station with its seven residents on Thursday. Starliner will remain docked for just over a week, undergoing checkouts before landing in the American West.\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX's capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA\u00b4s Orion capsules for moon missions. Plans called for Wilmore and Williams to briefly take manual control to test out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was delivering supplies to the space station, and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing has a more traditional \"astrovan.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight\u00b4s end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station\u00b4s planned end in 2030. Boeing has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks, but these rides are separate from NASA's dedicated six-month missions.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space\u00b4s mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will attempt to deliver cargo to the station later this year, before accepting passengers. It is due to launch on ULA's new Vulcan rocket, the eventual successor to the Atlas V.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u00b4s Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is the first launch with astronauts of the Boeing spacecraft and United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. Credits: NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavor to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. The only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Now on its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that starts its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nStarliner will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told a news conference that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that today \"it all lined up.\"\n\n\"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... We're on orbit with Butch and Suni, it's been a longtime coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nBoeing shares were up less than 1% in early afternoon trade.\n\n\"Starliner ascends to the heavens,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the U.S. space agency.\n\nNelson called the launch \"a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nBOEING AMBITIONS\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of it if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering manually en route to ISS.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another step in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.", "source": {"uri":

Sign up for NBC Boston's newsletters.\n\n[The live stream above is scheduled to start at 9:45 a.m. ET. If you don't see a video player at that time, please refresh the page.\n\nBoeing aims to launch its first Starliner flight with astronauts on Wednesday, in the latest attempt to fly the long-delayed spacecraft.\n\nThe launch is scheduled for 10:52 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Two NASA astronauts will be aboard the Starliner capsule, which will be carried by United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station.\n\nWednesday is the latest in a series of attempts to launch the mission, which is known as the Boeing crew flight test. On Saturday, a launch attempt was called off in the final minutes of the countdown due to a problem with one of the computer's that provides ground support to the rocket. In early May, another attempt was called off due to an issue detected with the rocket itself.\n\nIf the launch is postponed again, Boeing has a backup opportunity scheduled for Thursday.\n\nSign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance - or ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin - replaced the rocket's problematic valve after the May attempt and replaced a faulty part in the ground infrastructure computer after Saturday's attempt.\n\nIn between the two previous launch attempts, NASA and Boeing found a \"small\" helium leak in Starliner, causing the agency and company to perform another series of assessments. After analysis, NASA and Boeing believe the source of the leak is in the spacecraft's helium propulsion system. But officials said after an investigation that the leak is \"stable\" and \"not a safety of flight issue.\"\n\nStarliner's crew debut has been delayed by years, while SpaceX's competing Dragon capsule has flown astronauts for NASA regularly since 2020 under the agency's Commercial Crew program. To date, Boeing has eaten $1.5 billion in costs due to Starliner setbacks and nearly $5 billion of NASA development funds.\n\nThe spacecraft was once seen as a competitor to SpaceX's Dragon. However, various setbacks and delays have steadily slipped Starliner into a backup position for NASA, with the agency taking the rare step of reassigning astronauts off the first Boeing crew flights in 2021. Boeing is under contract to fly six operational Starliner missions to the ISS.\n\nWednesday's crew flight test represents the final major step before receiving NASA certification to begin regular missions.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams are flying on Starliner, with the former serving as the spacecraft's commander and the latter as its pilot.\n\nWilmore joined NASA in 2000 and has flown to space twice previously on the Space Shuttle and Russia's Soyuz. Before NASA, Wilmore was a U.S. Navy pilot.\n\nWilliams was selected by NASA in 1998 and has also flown to space twice before, on the Space Shuttle and then the Soyuz. Williams was also a Navy pilot, like Wilmore, before joining the space agency.\n\nStarliner launches on ULA's Atlas V. The rocket debuted in 2002, and the Starliner crew flight test represents its 100th launch.\n\nThe capsule itself is built to carry as many as four NASA astronauts per flight and more than 200 pounds of research and cargo. The spacecraft lands using a parachute and airbag system. Starliner is reusable, with each capsule designed to fly as many as 10 missions.\n\nBoeing's crew flight test aims to certify the Starliner system as capable of carrying NASA astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nIf Starliner launches on Wednesday, it will fly in space for about 25 hours before a planned docking with the International Space Station at 12:15 p.m. on Thursday. The astronauts will then spend about a week on the ISS, focused on testing Starliner, before returning to Earth.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/06/107423304-1717422827734-gettyimages-2155284185-AFP_34UR9BH.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

If you don't see a video player at that time, please refresh the page.\n\nBoeing aims to launch its first Starliner flight with astronauts on Wednesday, in the latest attempt to fly the long-delayed spacecraft.\n\nThe launch is scheduled for 10:52 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Two NASA astronauts will be aboard the Starliner capsule, which will be carried by United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station.\n\nWednesday is the latest in a series of attempts to launch the mission, which is known as the Boeing crew flight test. On Saturday, a launch attempt was called off in the final minutes of the countdown due to a problem with one of the computer's that provides ground support to the rocket. In early May, another attempt was called off due to an issue detected with the rocket itself.\n\nIf the launch is postponed again, Boeing has a backup opportunity scheduled for Thursday.\n\nSign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance - or ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin - replaced the rocket's problematic valve after the May attempt and replaced a faulty part in the ground infrastructure computer after Saturday's attempt.\n\nIn between the two previous launch attempts, NASA and Boeing found a \"small\" helium leak in Starliner, causing the agency and company to perform another series of assessments. After analysis, NASA and Boeing believe the source of the leak is in the spacecraft's helium propulsion system. But officials said after an investigation that the leak is \"stable\" and \"not a safety of flight issue.\"\n\nStarliner's crew debut has been delayed by years, while SpaceX's competing Dragon capsule has flown astronauts for NASA regularly since 2020 under the agency's Commercial Crew program. To date, Boeing has eaten $1.5 billion in costs due to Starliner setbacks and nearly $5 billion of NASA development funds.\n\nThe spacecraft was once seen as a competitor to SpaceX's Dragon. However, various setbacks and delays have steadily slipped Starliner into a backup position for NASA, with the agency taking the rare step of reassigning astronauts off the first Boeing crew flights in 2021. Boeing is under contract to fly six operational Starliner missions to the ISS.\n\nWednesday's crew flight test represents the final major step before receiving NASA certification to begin regular missions.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams are flying on Starliner, with the former serving as the spacecraft's commander and the latter as its pilot.\n\nWilmore joined NASA in 2000 and has flown to space twice previously on the Space Shuttle and Russia's Soyuz. Before NASA, Wilmore was a U.S. Navy pilot.\n\nWilliams was selected by NASA in 1998 and has also flown to space twice before, on the Space Shuttle and then the Soyuz. Williams was also a Navy pilot, like Wilmore, before joining the space agency.\n\nStarliner launches on ULA's Atlas V. The rocket debuted in 2002, and the Starliner crew flight test represents its 100th launch.\n\nThe capsule itself is built to carry as many as four NASA astronauts per flight and more than 200 pounds of research and cargo. The spacecraft lands using a parachute and airbag system. Starliner is reusable, with each capsule designed to fly as many as 10 missions.\n\nBoeing's crew flight test aims to certify the Starliner system as capable of carrying NASA astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nIf Starliner launches on Wednesday, it will fly in space for about 25 hours before a planned docking with the International Space Station at 12:15 p.m. on Thursday. The astronauts will then spend about a week on the ISS, focused on testing Starliner, before returning to Earth.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2024/06/107423304-1717422827734-gettyimages-2155284185-AFP_34UR9BH.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nRELATED: Boeing's Starliner launch scrubbed for 3rd time\n\nWilmore and Williams - retired Navy captains and former space station residents - stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nThe flight, if successful, will rival SpaceX's prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand American options for ferrying astronauts to ISS.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries - Russia, the U.S. and China - had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThis story comes from our news partner ABC13 Houston.", "source": {"uri": "queondamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u00a1Que Onda Magazine!"},

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavor to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule atop an Atlas V rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on a mission to the International Space Station, Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. The only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"", "source":

The next launch attempt window NASA will aim for is Wednesday.\n\nTwo experienced astronauts, including a Tennessee native, are part of an even higher stakes demonstration after the scrapping of the last two mission. This is the final demonstration before the spacecraft can be approved for routine trips to orbit.\n\nBarry \"Butch\" Wilmore, a Mt. Juliet High School and Tennessee Tech graduate, will be in the cockpit along with Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, for the CST-100 Starliner test mission Wednesday in Florida. Wilmore and Williams will be the first crew on board for a Starliner orbital flight test.\n\nWhen is the Boeing Starliner's third launch attempt?\n\nAccording to Space.com, the mission is set to launch at 10:52 a.m. ET/ 9:52 a.m. CT Wednesday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on Florida's Space Coast.\n\nThe Starliner and the two astronauts will be atop a ULA Atlas V rocket.\n\nWhy were the first two Starliner launches scrubbed?\n\nThe first launch attempt was supposed to take place almost a month ago on May 6 but was scrubbed due to a stuck valve on the rocket launching Starliner. It was replaced, but a small helium leak on one of Starliner's thrusters was also discovered by engineers. The next attempt wouldn't happen until June.\n\nOn Saturday, June 1, Starliner was expected to make the journey to the International Space Station but the launch attempt was stopped \"due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count,\" said a post from NASA Commercial Crew on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWhat is Boeing's Starliner purpose?\n\nBoeing's Starliner is intended to be a vehicle to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. The Starliner's design is meant to accommodate no more than seven passengers for low-Earth orbit missions. NASA intends for the capsule to carry only four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the International Space Station.\n\nThis launch is one of several that NASA has had after partnering with private industry to help continue programs for space travel and exploration.\n\nBoeing received a $4.2 billion contract from NASA in 2014, but didn't launch its first unmanned mission in 2019. The Starliner project is years behind competitors like Elon Musk's SpaceX program and is also over budget with the project. Boeing estimates the project has cost the private company $1 billion in losses, reports NPR.\n\nHow to watch the Boeing Starliner launch with NASA on Wednesday\n\nAs of Monday, June 3, a news release states the NASA livestream for the next attempt will take place the morning of the launch as the countdown milestones occur.\n\nFind NASA's livestream here.\n\nWho are the NASA astronauts on Boeing's Starliner?\n\nBoth Williams and Wilmore are experienced pilots with the Navy and have flown in space twice, according to Florida Today, a USA TODAY Network publication.

The launch, conducted from Cape Canaveral, was successful despite previous delays. Astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams are en route to the ISS, showcasing Boeing's potential in space travel.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner capsule flew its first crew of astronauts to space on Wednesday from Florida in a much-delayed test mission to the International Space Station, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The CST-100 Starliner, with astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew was headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS) following years of technical problems, delays and a successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into sunny skies from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that starts its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Starliner will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. Mark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told a news conference that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\"\n\n\"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... We're on orbit with Butch and Suni, it's been a longtime coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said. Boeing shares were up less than 1% in early afternoon trade.\n\n\"Starliner ascends to the heavens,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the U.S. space agency. Nelson called the launch \"a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch. The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. BOEING AMBITIONS\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. The longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the agency's Artemis program. Starliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media. Although Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of it if necessary.

A failed power distribution source at SLC-41 halted Saturday's launch attempt. As ground crews changed out and tested the system Sunday, Wilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, continued preparations for the mission as they remained quarantined at adjacent Kennedy Space Center.\n\n\"The ULA team identified an issue with a single ground power supply within one of the three redundant chassis that provides power to a subset of computer cards controlling various system functions, including the card responsible for the stable replenishment topping valves for the Centaur upper stage. All three of these chassis are required to enter the terminal phase of the launch countdown to ensure crew safety,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\n\"I really appreciate all the work by the NASA, Boeing and ULA teams over the last week,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. \"In particular, the ULA team worked really hard to quickly learn more about these issues, kept our NASA and Boeing teams informed and protected for this next attempt. We will continue to take it one step at a time.\"\n\nLast month, the mission to certify Starliner for future manned missions was scrubbed 2 hours before launch over concerns about an oxygen relief valve. The noise heard May 6 turned out to be a mechanical valve that vents gas, which \"every now and then will flutter or buzz,\" according to Tory Bruno, ULA's chief executive officer.\n\nOnce Starliner successfully launches, the capsule will break away from the Atlas V rocket within the first 24 hours and fire its own engines to travel to the space station.\n\nWilmore and Williams, who are U.S. Navy-trained test pilots and helped develop the Starliner capsule, will use the mission to make sure all systems on board work as planned so that the spacecraft can be certified for future manned missions.\n\nStarliner will take Wilmore and Williams to the forward-facing port of the space station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThe astronauts will remain at the space station for about a week to test the Starliner spacecraft in preparation for certification, which could put Boeing in direct competition with SpaceX and its commercial flight program.\n\nWilmore and Williams will return to Earth 10 days after launch in the same capsule, which is to parachute to a landing in the southwestern United States.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Now on its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that starts its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nStarliner will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told a news conference that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\"\n\n\"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... We're on orbit with Butch and Suni, it's been a longtime coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nBoeing shares were up less than 1% in early afternoon trade.\n\n\"Starliner ascends to the heavens,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the US space agency.\n\nNelson called the launch \"a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of it if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering manually en route to ISS.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different US rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another step in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.", "source": {"uri":

The gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew were headed for a rendezvous with the ISS following years of technical problems, delays and a successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into sunny skies from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that starts its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 400km above Earth.\n\nStarliner will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told a news conference tens of thousands of things must go right during Starliner's launch, and on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\"\n\n\"We had just a perfect countdown and launch... We're on orbit with Butch and Suni, it's been a longtime coming. And we're really... proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nBoeing shares were up less than 1 percent in early afternoon trade.\n\n\"Starliner ascends to the heavens,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the US space agency.\n\nNelson called the launch \"a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars.\n\n\"See you back home,\" Nelson said.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny.\n\nAnother attempt last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent 500 days in space over two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nMore from Newshub\n\nBoeing calls off historic mission carrying two astronauts minutes before liftoff\n\n'Incredibly excited': Kiwi scientists to develop solar-powered aircraft with NASA\n\nBoeing ambitions\n\nWith its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, Boeing needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of it if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering manually en route to ISS.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different US rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another step in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.", "source": {"uri":

The ULA team identified an issue with a single ground power supply within one of the three redundant chassis that provides power to a subset of computer cards controlling various system functions, including the card responsible for the stable replenishment topping valves for the Centaur upper stage. All three of these chassis are required to enter the terminal phase of the launch countdown to ensure crew safety.\n\nOn Sunday, the chassis containing the faulty ground power unit was removed, visually inspected, and replaced with a spare chassis. No signs of physical damage were observed. A full failure analysis of the power unit will be performed to better understand root cause. Meanwhile, ULA has completed functional checkouts of the new chassis and the cards, and all hardware is performing normally.\n\nThe mission managers have opted for the next launch attempt on June 5. The U.S. Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron predicts a 90% chance of favorable weather conditions, with the cumulus cloud rule being the primary weather concern.

The system was unsuccessful in verifying the sequencer's necessary redundancy.\n\nULA will assess the ground support equipment overnight, and NASA will provide an update June 2 on next steps for the flight. The next available launch opportunities are Wednesday, June 5, and Thursday, June 6.\n\nWatch a replay of the news conference here.\n\nJUNE 1:\n\nThe launch of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner on its first crewed flight on an Atlas V with two NASA astronauts on board was scrubbed at T-3:50 -- 3 minutes, 50 seconds before the scheduled liftoff time of 12:25 p.m. EDT.\n\nULA scrubbed today's Crew Flight Test attempt due to an issue with the ground launch sequencer. The system was unsuccessful in verifying the sequencer's necessary redundancy and the team is evaluating the anomaly.\n\nThe team will complete a full assessment and is currently reconfiguring for a 24 hour recycle. We are targeting no earlier than (NET) Sunday, June 2 at 12:03 p.m. EDT from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nAt the last few minutes the astronauts' nerves are beginning to show. Photo captured on Saturday, June 1, by Satnews from ULA video stream.\n\nAt 12:21 PM EST A long and nerve racking morning was appearing to lead up to the much delayed NASA Boeing Starliner mission. HOWEVER after many other issues the Ground Launch Sequencer held at 4 minutes. Not knowing what the problem is the launch is scrubbed. Careful attention to offloading the crew.\n\nPhoto captured on Saturday, June 1, by Satnews from ULA video stream.\n\nWith gas leaks corrected and a malfunctioning fan inside the astronauts' suits in the last few minutes redundant systems were employed to overcome other various issues as well.\n\nAt 212 feet in the air the astronauts are in the process of egressing carefully.\n\nMore information to follow....\n\nOut of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew, we scrubbed the Crew Flight Test (CFT) launch attempt today due to an observation on a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage. The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment, so we are targeting the next launch attempt no earlier than Friday, May 10.\n\nThe cost involved is unknown.\n\nNASA released this statement: NASA and its mission partners scrubbed the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test launch attempt on Saturday, June 1, due to an observation of a ground launch sequencer. The system was unsuccessful in verifying the sequencer's necessary redundancy. The team is evaluating the upcoming launch opportunities on Sunday, June 2; Wednesday, June 5; and Thursday, June 6. NASA will update the launch coverage advisory timing as soon as possible.\n\nNASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) scrubbed today's launch opportunity due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count. The ULA team is working to understand the cause. The next launch opportunity is Sunday, June 2, at 12:03 p.m. EDT for launch of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test.\n\nThe ULA Atlas V rocket and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft are in a safe configuration, and NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are preparing to exit the spacecraft.\n\nULA just issued : \"Everything continues to progress towards the ULA Atlas V launch carrying the first crewed Boeing Starliner spacecraft for NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP).

Clearly this being the first launch ever of Boeing's Starliner transporting NASA's astronauts Butch and Suni is historical.\n\nThe following is the account today of the preparation underway for the first Boeing Starliner transporting humans to the International Space Station.\n\nEverything continues to progress towards the ULA Atlas V launch carrying the first crewed Boeing Starliner spacecraft for NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP). The mission is planned to lift off on Saturday, June 1 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\u202fThe launch is planned for 12:25 p.m. EDT.\u202fToday's forecast\u202fshows a 90 percent\u202fchance of favorable weather\u202fconditions for launch.\n\nNASA and Boeing teams polled \"go\" to proceed with plans to launch the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station at 12:25 p.m. EDT Saturday, June 1. During a Delta-Agency Flight Test Readiness Review Wednesday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, leaders from NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) verified launch readiness, including all systems, facilities, and teams supporting the test flight.\n\nA backup launch opportunity is available on Sunday, June 2, with additional launch windows on Wednesday, June 5, and Thursday, June 6.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Kennedy on May 28, and will remain in quarantine at the Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building until Saturday's launch. The crew previously quarantined in Houston while mission teams worked to resolve various items with the rocket and spacecraft since scrubbing an initial launch attempt on May 6.\n\nNext up, NASA leaders, along with Boeing and ULA partners, will hold a prelaunch news conference at 1 p.m. EDT Friday, May 31, at Kennedy's press auditorium.\n\nLiftoff of the Atlas V rocket and Starliner spacecraft will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The Crew Flight Test will send Wilmore and Williams to the orbiting laboratory for about a week before returning to Earth aboard the reusable crew capsule, which will make a parachute- and- airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States.\n\nManagers from NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) hosted a media teleconference to discuss ongoing work ahead of sending NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station as part of the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test.\n\nThe media event provided an update on a valve ULA replaced on the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket, as well as a small helium leak in the spacecraft's service module, and a propulsion system assessment to understand potential helium system impacts on some Starliner return scenarios.\n\nListen to a replay of the media teleconference on the agency's YouTube channel.\n\nWilmore and Williams are the first to launch aboard Boeing's Starliner on an Atlas V rocket. The astronauts will spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory before the crew capsule makes a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States.\n\nThe crew remains in quarantine in preparation for the launch. NASA, Boeing, and ULA also will participate in a Delta-Agency Flight Test Readiness Review on Wednesday, May 29, to evaluate the work performed since the last launch attempt on May 6.\n\nLiftoff is scheduled for 12:25 p.m. Saturday, June 1, from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. After successful completion of the flight test, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station.\n\nBoeing's update regarding delay of ULA's launch of NASA's Starliner\n\nStarliner docks to the ISS for the first time on OFT-2. (NASA photo)\n\nFollowing is a report from Boeing:\n\nNASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams continue working remaining open tasks in preparation for the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than 4:43 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing.\n\nOn May 11, the ULA team successfully replaced a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage. The team also performed re-pressurization and system purges, and tested the new valve, which performed normally.\n\nStarliner teams are working to resolve a small helium leak detected in the spacecraft's service module traced to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster. Helium is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire and is not combustible or toxic.\n\nNASA and Boeing are developing spacecraft testing and operational solutions to address the issue. As a part of the testing, Boeing will bring the propulsion system up to flight pressurization just as it does prior to launch, and then allow the helium system to vent naturally to validate existing data and strengthen flight rationale. Mission teams also completed a thorough review of the data from the May 6 launch attempt and are not tracking any other issues.\n\nThe Atlas V and Starliner remain in the Vertical Integration Facility at Space Launch Complex-41 on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, still in preflight quarantine, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend extra time with their families as prelaunch operations progress. The duo will fly back to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the coming days.\n\nULA's Boeing Starliner launch for NASA astronauts delayed again adding to the $1.5 billion over budget\n\nAn Atlas V N22 rocket will launch Boeing's Starliner on CFT. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nStarliner's mission carrying two NASA astronauts had been scheduled for liftoff from Florida last week until a technical issue with its Atlas 5 rocket prompted a delay to Friday, May 17. The launch of Starliner is now set for no earlier than 4:43 p.m. Tuesday, May 21 at 4:43 p.m. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, reportedly returned to Houston to be with their families and now plan to return to Florida in the coming days\n\nThis hitch in the latest postponement only compounds the expense for a program years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nBoeing stated that a small helium leak was detected in the spacecraft's service module that is the disposable module that sits below the spacecraft and contains the thrusters and launch abort engines.\n\nThe helium leak was found to be coming from a \"flange on a single reaction control system thruster.\" While helium is not reactive, it is used within thrusters to assist in firing. In order to ensure the safety of the spacecraft, the Boeing team states they plan to fully investigate the leak and that means bringing Starliner's propulsion system to the state seen before launch.\n\nBoeing added that they aren't currently tracking any other issues with the spacecraft.\n\nOriginally set for May 6, the launch was scrubbed when a faulty oxygen valve on the Atlas V was discovered with almost two hours left until launch. The crew was in the process of getting in the spacecraft when teams called off the launch to investigate the valve.\n\n\"And every now and again, in rare occasions, a valve like that can get into a position where it's just off the seat. Its temperature, its stiffness, everything is just right. And it'll flutter. Or it'll buzz -- in this case -- in cycle,\" ULA President Tory Bruno said during a press conference which followed the May 6 night scrub.\n\n\"We've seen that before,\" said Bruno. \"What you would typically do is activate the solenoid that forces the valve closed -- cycling the valve, if you will -- then you turn that on and let it return.\"\n\nNASA's statement regarding the scrub indicated that the two astronauts flying the CFT mission, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain at the Kennedy Space Center in pre-flight quarantine for this latest delay.\n\nThe delay enables United Launch Alliance to return the rocket to its Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) hangar near the pad to replace a liquid oxygen pressure regulation valve in the Centaur. That valve started oscillating after the stage was loaded with liquid oxygen, creating a buzzing noise noticed by launch pad crews.\n\nIn NASA's statement about the new delay, the agency said that while the valve vibration was dampened once the valve was closed after the scrub, that vibration returned twice while propellant was being offloaded from the rocket.\n\n\"After evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve,\" NASA stated.\n\nAt a briefing after the May 6 scrub, Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said the concern was that the vibration could have caused the valve to approach its rated life of 200,000 cycles. The valve was vibrating at 40 hertz, he noted.\n\nBruno continued that engineers would examine if those vibrations involved full cycles of the valve, and ULA would have to replace the valve. However, if the valve was only partially moving, then it was possible the valve was not nearing its design life and could be retained. Officials said at the briefing that they could try to launch again the next day, but later revised the launch date to the next opportunity, May 10, before this latest delay.\n\nNASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test now is targeted to launch no earlier than 6:16 p.m. EDT Friday, May 17, to the International Space Station. Following a thorough data review completed on Tuesday, United Launch Alliance decided to remove and replace a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage.\n\nULA plans to roll the rocket, with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, back to its Vertical Integration Facility on Wednesday, May 8, to begin the replacement. The ULA team will perform leak checks and functional checkouts in support of the next launch attempt.\n\nThe oscillating behavior of the valve during prelaunch operations ultimately resulted in mission teams calling a launch scrub on May 6. After the ground and flight crew safely egressed from Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) last night, the ULA team successfully commanded the valve closed and the oscillations were temporarily dampened. The oscillations then re-occurred twice during fuel removal operations. After evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve.\n\nMission managers discussed the details leading to the decision to scrub the May 6 launch opportunity during a news conference shortly after the call at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will remain at crew quarters in health stabilization until the next launch opportunity. The duo will be the first to launch aboard Starliner to the space station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew, we scrubbed the Crew Flight Test (CFT) launch attempt today due to an observation on a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage. The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment, so we are targeting the next launch attempt no earlier than Friday, May 10.\n\nPilot ingress.

She is married and is a dog mom.\n\nULA's Launch director Tom Heter III has scrubbed tonight's Starliner launch. Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew, we scrubbed the Crew Flight Test (CFT) launch attempt today due to an observation on a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage. The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment, so we are targeting the next launch attempt no earlier than Friday, May 10.\n\nStarliner's history has numerous scrubs. Boeing launched an orbital test flight without astronauts twice because of a botched first attempt in 2019 that failed to reach the ISS. They were also set to launch Williams and Wilmore last summer, but Boeing managers revealed new issues with the spacecraft after further examining data from Starliner's OFT orbital flight test in May 2022.\n\nThe launch was halted due to an issue that cropped up with a valve on the spacecraft's rocket two hours before launch. Mission controllers declared a launch \"scrub\" after an anomaly was detected on an oxygen valve on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket\n\nA new launch date has not yet been announced.\n\nThe official crew portrait celebrates the astronauts of the CFT mission.

The mission is planned to lift off on Monday, May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The launch is planned for 10:34 p.m. EDT. Today's forecast shows a 95 percent chance of favorable weather conditions for launch.\n\nLaunch Forecast Summary:\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints: 5%\n\nPrimary concerns: Cumulus Cloud Rule\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints for 24-hour delay: 5%\n\nThe names of Wilmore and Williams will soon join Glenn, Carpenter, Schirra and Cooper as pioneering astronauts to launch atop Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe first four Americans to orbit the Earth during NASA's Project Mercury all rode early Atlas boosters to place their single-seat capsules into space. Now 60 years later, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will launch astronauts using the latest generation of Atlas V rockets for NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 1962, the Atlas 109-D rocket launched John Glenn, the first American ever to circle the planet in space, and his Friendship 7 capsule. His three orbits made Glenn a national hero.\n\nThe Atlas 107-D rocket launched Scott Carpenter and Aurora 7 on May 24, 1962, to orbit the Earth three times. Sigma 7 and Walter Schirra were launched by Atlas 113-D on Oct. 3, 1962, to complete six orbits. And Atlas 130-D launched Faith 7 and Gordon Cooper on May 15, 1963 for a 34-hour voyage in orbit, completing the Mercury missions.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be the first crew members to fly aboard Starliner on its Crew Flight Test (CFT). Wilmore and Williams, both Naval aviators, military test pilots and former commanders of the International Space Station, have worked closely with Boeing to develop the Starliner spacecraft and ULA on the features required to carry crew.\n\nAtlas V will launch Starliner on its journey to rendezvous and dock with the space station, where the two astronauts will live and work for about a week before undocking and returning to Earth to land at a site in the Western U.S.\n\nWilmore, commander of the CFT mission, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights to the space station. Wilmore is from Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, and earned degrees from Tennessee Technological University in electrical engineering and the University of Tennessee in aviation systems. He is married with two daughters.\n\nWilmore has accumulated more than 8,000 flight hours and 663 carrier landings, all in tactical jet aircraft, and is a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School. During his tenure as a fleet Naval officer and aviator, Wilmore completed four operational deployments, flying the A-7E and F/A 18 aircraft from the decks of the USS Forrestal, USS Kennedy, USS Enterprise and the USS Eisenhower aircraft carriers.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in July 2000, Wilmore was assigned technical duties representing the Astronaut Office on all propulsion systems, including the space shuttle main engines, solid rocket motors and external tank, and also led the astronaut support team that traveled to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida, in support of launch and landing operations. To date Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nHe completed his first flight as pilot of space shuttle Atlantis on STS-129, logging 11 days in space in November 2009. This was the 31st shuttle flight to the station. During the mission, the crew delivered two Express Logistics Carrier racks and about 30,000 pounds of replacement parts to maintain the station's proper orientation in space.\n\nWilmore's second flight was as a long-duration resident aboard the station. From September to November 2014, he served as flight engineer for Expedition 41 and then as commander of Expedition 42 from November 2014 to March 2015 totaling nearly six months in space. Wilmore performed three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. In addition, he completed a spacewalk to replace a failed voltage regulator. Wilmore and two Roscosmos cosmonauts launched to the space station in a Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and returned to Earth safely to touch down in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan after the 167-day mission.\n\nWilliams, pilot of the CFT mission, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights as a long-duration resident aboard the space station. Williams is from Needham, Massachusetts, and earned a physical science degree from the U.S. Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology. She is married and is a dog mom.\n\nWilliams has accumulated 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft. She received her designation as a Basic Diving Officer and later was designated a Naval Aviator. Williams was selected for United States Naval Test Pilot School, and after graduation she was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer. She went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an Instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and the school's Safety Officer.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on 7 spacewalks. Williams worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew. After her first flight, she served as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office. She then performed another long-duration mission that included serving as station commander.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 from December 2006 to June 2007, launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the station. While onboard, Williams established a world record for females at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight.\n\nWilliams launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Soyuz with a Roscosmos cosmonaut and Japanese astronaut for Expedition 32/33 from July to November 2012. Williams spent 127 days in space conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory. She performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repaired an ammonia leak on a station radiator.\n\nULA's L-2 report states that everything continues to progress towards the ULA Atlas V launch carrying the first crewed Boeing Starliner spacecraft for NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP).\n\nThe mission is planned to lift off on Monday, May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

This visibility map shows when and where your best chances are to see the rocket as it lifts off Monday at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 UTC) from Cape Canaveral.\n\nToday's forecast shows a 90 percent chance of favorable weather conditions for launch.\n\nLaunch Forecast Summary:\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints: 10%\n\nPrimary concerns: Detached Anvil\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints for 24-hour delay: 10%\n\nUnited Launch Alliance (ULA) uses a unique version of its Atlas V countdown for human spaceflight missions, in the name of safety, to complete hazardous fueling operations and then place the rocket in a quiescent state before the astronauts board.\n\nLaunch of the Crew Flight Test (CFT) is planned for May 6 at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 UTC) from Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. A live countdown blog and launch webcast in collaboration with Boeing and NASA will be available on the ULA website.\n\nThe Atlas V launch countdown begins 11 hours and 20 minutes before liftoff and features a four-hour planned, built-in hold at the T-minus four-minute mark for crew ingress into Starliner.\n\nThe CFT astronauts will board Starliner after Atlas V is readied. Photo by NASA\n\nOverseeing the start of the countdown is the \"Preps Team\" of console operators inside the Advanced Spaceflight Operations Center. Launch Conductor Dillon Rice will orchestrate the countdown procedures from the Launch Control Center while ULA Launch Director James Whelan is at the helm in the Mission Director's Center.\n\nThis initial phase of the count will be spent powering up the rocket, running system checkouts, completing standard pre-launch testing and performing final preparations on the rocket and pad systems for propellant-loading operations.\n\nThe Preps Team will lead the countdown through its first five hours, then a shift change occurs to hand each station to the \"Tanking & Launch Team\" of console operators. These counterparts take responsibilities for the next six hours through liftoff, led by ULA Chief Launch Conductor Doug Lebo and ULA Launch Director Tom Heter.\n\nThe shift handover happens during the planned, hour-long countdown hold at T-minus two hours. Just before the hold concludes, readiness polls are conducted to authorize the start of cryogenic tanking. With the pad cleared of all personnel, the hazardous operation of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen filling the Atlas V rocket's stages for launch is performed.\n\nOnce fueling is completed and the rocket's tanks placed into stable replenishment, the countdown enters the extended hold at T-minus four minutes. The Blue Team is dispatched to the pad's 200-foot-tall (61-m) Crew Access Tower (CAT) to ready the White Room and Starliner crew module for arrival of the astronauts, assist the crew into their seats and then close the hatch for flight.\n\nThe team is comprised of eight specialists from ULA and Boeing. Dane Drefke, ULA's mechanical operations lead engineer serves as the Blue Team Leader (BTL). He is in charge of the Blue Team's activities and has an obligation to ensure everyone's safety.\n\nULA's three representatives on the Blue Team begin activities by walking across the 48-foot-long (14.6-m) retractable catwalk extending from the CAT to the White Room. Their duties include verifying the White Room is safe for personnel to enter, establishing access to the capsule, deploying the environmental seal between the pad and spacecraft and setting up access platforms.\n\nThe ULA members then switch places with five Boeing technicians, waiting in the wings on the CAT, led by Boeing's Pad Team Leader Nate Keyek-Franssen for assisting the crew into the spacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts, commander Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams, receive a final weather briefing and don their spacesuits before leaving NASA's Crew Quarters in the Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building at the Kennedy Space Center. Departure to board Boeing's Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV) occurs about three hours and 20 minutes before launch.\n\nThe trip to SLC-41 will take about 25 minutes, with the CTV arriving at the base of the CAT approximately two hours and 55 minutes before launch. The astronauts will take the elevator to Level 12 while the CTV convoy departs the pad and heads to the safe fallback area.\n\nOnce crew ingress is completed, another weather briefing will be held 90 minutes before launch, to inform mission managers that conditions are suitable for the Blue Team to close the Starliner hatch and proceed with the countdown. Pending a go, Boeing technicians will close the hatch and perform cabin leak checks to verify the integrity of the seal.\n\nThe Crew Access Arm enables the astronauts to board the spacecraft. Photo by United Launch\n\nAllianceBoeing personnel then depart the White Room so that the ULA technicians can retract access platforms and deflate the environmental seal around the spacecraft to prepare the Crew Access Arm for rotation to the launch position later in the countdown. The entire Blue Team departs the pad about 35 minutes before liftoff.\n\nThe access arm will be hydraulically swung away from the spacecraft 11 minutes prior to launch. The process will take about two minutes to reach the stowed position against the CAT. If the need arises, the arm can be redeployed in less than 15 seconds by dropping counterweights.\n\nSeven minutes before launch, Lebo performs the readiness polling of the launch team members, Ascent Flight Director Mike Lammers in Houston and the Starliner crew before Heter gives final permission to launch. The countdown clocks resume four minutes before liftoff to put the rocket on internal power, pressurize its tanks, arm systems and start the main engine.\n\nThe daily available launch window is instantaneous, meaning there is only an instant in time each day for launch to occur. This split second happens when the orbital plane of the International Space Station passes over the launch pad, thereby enabling Atlas V to put Starliner on the proper trajectory to intercept the station for rendezvous and docking.\n\nThe main engine and twin solid rocket boosters generate 1.6 million pounds (7.1 mega-Newtons) of thrust to begin the voyage of Wilmore and Williams. The commander will call out \"roll program\" as Atlas V clears the tower to place the astronauts heads-up for their ride to space.\n\nThe main engine will ease back for a period of deep throttling, going into its throttle bucket during the region of maximum aerodynamic stresses on the rocket in the dense lower atmosphere and to lessen the G-loads on the crew.\n\nThe solid rocket boosters burn for a minute-and-a-half, followed by the main engine revving back to full throttle, to triple the rocket's velocity through the remaining first stage of flight.\n\nJust over two minutes after liftoff, Atlas V will have burned nearly 500,000 pounds (227,000 kg) of fuel and weigh only half of what it did at launch.\n\nAn illustration depicts Atlas V stagging during the launch of Starliner.\n\nFollowing the first stage engine shutdown, the Atlas V common core booster will jettison from the Centaur four minutes and 35 seconds after liftoff. The Centaur ignites both engines 10 seconds later at an altitude of approximately 60 nautical miles (111 km).\n\nThe Centaur burn will last just over seven minutes to deliver Starliner at the desired injection point for separation at T+plus 14 minutes, 55 seconds into a 98 by 39-nautical mile (181\u00d772-km) suborbital trajectory, inclined 51.6 degrees relative to the equator.\n\nAtlas V will launch northeasterly from Cape Canaveral, paralleling the Eastern Seaboard and crossing the North Atlantic to accelerate Starliner to 17,475 mph (28,123 kmph).\n\nFor Starliner missions, Atlas V takes a special trajectory to space that requires the Centaur upper stage to use two engines instead of one. The double-engine configuration allows the rocket to fly a flatter trajectory and ensure the spacecraft can execute an abort at any time to bring the astronauts back to Earth safely if a problem occurs.\n\nDual Engine Centaur also enables the customized flight profile for Starliner that features just a single burn and a limited acceleration rate to manage the G-force experienced by the astronauts aboard.\n\nAfter Centaur releases Starliner, the spacecraft employs the same operational procedure as the space shuttle, which also launched on suborbital trajectories, by performing an orbital-maneuvering engine firing to reach a stable orbit about 15 minutes after separation.\n\nULA's Starliner in countdown mode and Status Check for first human launch of NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams to ISS\n\nAtlas V will launch Boeing's Starliner with two NASA astronauts on the Crew Flight Test mission.

CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.\n\nOn the shoulders of Atlas, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will soon launch two NASA astronauts on the Crew Test Flight (CFT) to the International Space Station for NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\nUnited Launch Alliance (ULA) is readying the Atlas V rocket for the historic flight test that is targeted for launch on May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be the first crew members to fly aboard Starliner. Wilmore, the CFT commander, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights to the space station. Williams, serving as the CFT pilot, is also a retired Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights as a long-duration resident aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nStarliner arrives at the VIF. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nThis morning, Starliner traveled from Boeing's Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to ULA's Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) for connection to the Atlas V.\n\nULA's motorized payload transporter, adapted to carry Starliner, moved at a top speed of 5 mph, heading from the C3PF, a former space shuttle hangar, eastward to the beach and then southward to the launch site. The transporter deck also provided Starliner with environmental controls to keep its compartments in good health during the transport.\n\nApproaching the VIF, the transporter maneuvered up to the 30-story-tall building's doorway and parked. A four-point lifting sling, called the Handling Fixture Hoist Tool, was connected to the Starliner, for the overhead crane to carefully raise the spacecraft onto the Atlas V waiting inside the VIF aboard its Mobile Launch Platform (MLP).\n\nStarliner was positioned for mating to the Launch Vehicle Adapter (LVA) that serves as the spacecraft's cradle on the rocket during ascent. The LVA also features the aeroskirt structure that smooths the air over the combined payload and Atlas V for aerodynamic stability.\n\nNext up is the integrated systems test, a tip-to-tail electrical check of the 172-foot-tall (52-meter) Atlas V and Starliner stack.\n\nAtlas V and Starliner stand ready for CFT. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nThe MLP will move the rocket and spacecraft to the pad approximately two days prior to liftoff for final sequence of activities that include testing, fueling, boarding of the astronaut crew and launch.\n\nStarliner is a next-generation, autonomous spacecraft for safe and reliable crew and cargo transportation to and from low-Earth orbit destinations. For NASA missions to the orbiting laboratory, Starliner will carry up to four NASA-sponsored crew members and about 220 pounds of time-critical scientific research.\n\nCFT will reuse the Starliner crew module that flew the first OFT mission, named Calypso by Williams.\n\nFollowing a successful CFT mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying the Starliner spacecraft and systems for crew missions to the space station. Long-duration commercial crew rotation missions enable NASA to continue the important research and technology investigations taking place aboard the orbiting laboratory. Such research benefits people on Earth and lays the groundwork for future space exploration.\n\nUpdate to ULA's Starliner's first human launch of NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams to ISS\n\nLaunch Vehicle on Stand: Atlas V Starliner Crew Flight Test\n\nThe United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V booster arrives at the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) adjacent to Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket will launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on the Crew Flight Test (CFT) with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nDaily routines and dress rehearsals keep everyone busy in preparation for the first launch of humans in an ULA Atlas V rocket to the ISS. Here's a peek at some of the proceedings that are taking place in beautiful Florida and the weather is picture perfect.\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch on May 6, 2024 at 10:34 p.m. EDT Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita (Suni) Williams on the Crew Flight Test (CFT).\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch on May 6, 2024 at 10:34 p.m. EDT Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita (Suni) Williams on the Crew Flight Test (CFT).\n\nFollowing separation from Atlas V, Starliner engines will burn taking it the rest of the way to orbit and on to the International Space Station. CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Go Atlas! Go Centaur! Go Starliner!\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts on the Crew Flight Test (CFT). Following separation from Atlas V, Starliner engines will burn taking it the rest of the way to orbit and on to the International Space Station. CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.\n\nCFT is the final test to demonstrate the full end-of-end capabilities of the Starliner system to deliver crews to and from the space station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The unique Atlas configuration for Starliner includes a dual-engine Centaur upper stage to deliver the performance needed to shape the trajectory for crew safety; a launch vehicle adapter that structurally attaches the Starliner to the Atlas V rocket for ascent; a 70-inch-long (1.8-m) aeroskirt to enhance the aerodynamic characteristics, stability and loads of the Atlas V; and an Emergency Detection System that provides an extra layer of safety for astronauts riding the reliable Atlas V. The Atlas V Starliner launch countdown features a four-hour planned, built-in hold at the T-minus 4-minute mark. This allows the rocket to be fueled and placed in a quiescent state before boarding of the astronauts into the spacecraft.\n\nCFT bridges the history of Atlas with today's rocket. The first orbital spaceflights of American astronauts in the 1960s were launched in Project Mercury by Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral. That legacy continues with Atlas V launching crews from U.S. soil.\n\nModified specifically for the Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, the Atlas V Starliner configuration does not include a payload fairing. Instead, the Starliner's insulated surfaces take the place of the fairing to protect the uncrewed spacecraft during ascent. The vehicle's height with the Boeing CST-100 Starliner is approximately 172 ft (52.4 meters).\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner is attached to the Atlas V using a launch vehicle adapter (LVA), which also includes an aeroskirt to reduce the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. The aeroskirt is jettisoned for improved performance following booster stage separation.\n\nThe Centaur second stage is 10 ft (3 meters) in diameter and 41.5 ft (12.6 meters) in length. Its propellant tanks are pressure-stabilized and constructed of corrosion-resistant stainless steel. Centaur is a cryogenic vehicle, fueled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Atlas V configuration for this mission is powered by dual RL10A-4-2 engines, each producing 22,600 lbs (100.5 kilo-Newtons) of thrust. The cryogenic tanks are insulated with a combination of helium-purged blankets, radiation shields and spray-on foam insulation (SOFI). The Centaur forward adapter (CFA) provides structural mountings for the fault-tolerant avionics system and electrical interfaces with the spacecraft. The Centaur also includes an Emergency Detection System (EDS) that monitors for critical hazards to detect an imminent or occurring failure. The EDS also provides critical in-flight data which supports jettison of the ascent cover and initiates CST-100 Starliner spacecraft separation.\n\nThe booster is 12.5 ft (3.81 meters) in diameter and 106.5 ft (32.4 meters) in length. The booster's tanks are structurally rigid and constructed of isogrid aluminum barrels, spun-formed aluminum domes and intertank skirts. Booster propulsion is provided by the RD-180 engine system (a single engine with two thrust chambers). The RD-180 burns RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly purified kerosene) and liquid oxygen and delivers 860,200 lbs (3.83 mega-Newtons) of thrust at sea level. Two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) generate the additional power required at liftoff, with each SRB providing 348,500 lbs (1.55 mega-Newtons) of thrust. The Centaur avionics system provides guidance, flight control and vehicle sequencing functions during the booster and Centaur phases of flight.\n\nSpace Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41), the East Coast home of the Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, employs a \"clean pad\" concept of operations to ready launch vehicles and payloads for ascent into space. The rocket elements are assembled atop a Mobile Launch Platform inside the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) located adjacent to the launch pad. The platform and fully stacked Atlas V then travel by rail approximately 1,800 feet northward from the VIF to the pad for the final countdown, fueling and liftoff. Complex 41 was constructed by the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s for the Titan rocket program. The site was rejuvenated in support of the Atlas V starting in the late 1990s.", "source": {"uri": "news.satnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.satnews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The next launch attempt window NASA will aim for is Wednesday.\n\nTwo experienced astronauts, including a Tennessee native, are part of an even higher stakes demonstration after the scrapping of the last two mission. This is the final demonstration before the spacecraft can be approved for routine trips to orbit.\n\nBarry \"Butch\" Wilmore, a Mt. Juliet High School and Tennessee Tech graduate, will be in the cockpit along with Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, for the CST-100 Starliner test mission Wednesday in Florida. Wilmore and Williams will be the first crew on board for a Starliner orbital flight test.\n\nAccording to Space.com, the mission is set to launch at 10:52 a.m. ET/ 9:52 a.m. CT Wednesday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on Florida's Space Coast.\n\nThe Starliner and the two astronauts will be atop a ULA Atlas V rocket.\n\nThe first launch attempt was supposed to take place almost a month ago on May 6 but was scrubbed due to a stuck valve on the rocket launching Starliner. It was replaced, but a small helium leak on one of Starliner's thrusters was also discovered by engineers. The next attempt wouldn't happen until June.\n\nOn Saturday, June 1, Starliner was expected to make the journey to the International Space Station but the launch attempt was stopped \"due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count,\" said a post from NASA Commercial Crew on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBoeing's Starliner is intended to be a vehicle to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. The Starliner's design is meant to accommodate no more than seven passengers for low-Earth orbit missions. NASA intends for the capsule to carry only four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the International Space Station.\n\nThis launch is one of several that NASA has had after partnering with private industry to help continue programs for space travel and exploration.\n\nBoeing received a $4.2 billion contract from NASA in 2014, but didn't launch its first unmanned mission in 2019. The Starliner project is years behind competitors like Elon Musk's SpaceX program and is also over budget with the project.

Wilmore and Williams, both NASA veteran astronauts, will be on board.Wilmore will be the commander of the mission and has been an astronaut for NASA since July 2000. He is a veteran of two spaceflights.Williams will be the pilot of the mission and has been a NASA astronaut since 1998. She is a veteran of two space missions.Both astronauts went back home after the mission's many delays but returned to Central Florida last week for the scrubbed June 1 launch attempt. As of last check on Wednesday morning, the two astronauts were in place inside the spacecraft.The two will spend eight days on the International Space Station if all goes as planned.Why was the mission delayed?When the original scrub was called on May 6, officials cited the cause as a mechanical issue involving \"a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage\" on the Atlas V rocket.Officials rolled the rocket back to its Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and successfully replaced the pressure regulation valve, which prevents the oxygen tank from building up too much pressure.The launch was moved to May 17 to allow for more testing but was pushed back to May 21 when Boeing said Starliner teams were working to resolve a small helium leak detected in the spacecraft's service module.Then, the launch was pushed back to May 25 when officials announced they, once again, needed more time to resolve the issue.Eventually, officials said they would forego that May 25 launch attempt completely.The launch was indefinitely on hold until officials said they were prepared for a June 1 launch attempt.Last week, mission partners polled \"go\" to proceed with plans for that launch and rolled the Atlas V rocket out to the pad for the first time since the original scrub.On Saturday, the countdown was going smoothly, when suddenly, officials scrubbed the launch just minutes before takeoff. The sudden scrub was due to the failure of some ground support equipment.ULA said their teams worked overnight to identify the problem and were able to replace a faulty power supply system in their ground operations computers.At last check, ULA said the system is now performing normally following a number of functionality checks.

She is a veteran of two space missions.\n\nBoth astronauts went back home after the mission's many delays but returned to Central Florida last week for the scrubbed June 1 launch attempt.\n\nAs of last check on Wednesday morning, the two astronauts were in place inside the spacecraft.\n\nThe two will spend eight days on the International Space Station if all goes as planned.\n\nWhy was the mission delayed?\n\nWhen the original scrub was called on May 6, officials cited the cause as a mechanical issue involving \"a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage\" on the Atlas V rocket.\n\nOfficials rolled the rocket back to its Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and successfully replaced the pressure regulation valve, which prevents the oxygen tank from building up too much pressure.\n\nThe launch was moved to May 17 to allow for more testing but was pushed back to May 21 when Boeing said Starliner teams were working to resolve a small helium leak detected in the spacecraft's service module.\n\nThen, the launch was pushed back to May 25 when officials announced they, once again, needed more time to resolve the issue.\n\nEventually, officials said they would forego that May 25 launch attempt completely.\n\nThe launch was indefinitely on hold until officials said they were prepared for a June 1 launch attempt.\n\nLast week, mission partners polled \"go\" to proceed with plans for that launch and rolled the Atlas V rocket out to the pad for the first time since the original scrub.\n\nOn Saturday, the countdown was going smoothly, when suddenly, officials scrubbed the launch just minutes before takeoff. The sudden scrub was due to the failure of some ground support equipment.\n\nULA said their teams worked overnight to identify the problem and were able to replace a faulty power supply system in their ground operations computers.\n\nAt last check, ULA said the system is now performing normally following a number of functionality checks.", "source": {"uri": "ketv.com", "dataType": "news",

The launch marks a significant step for Boeing's space ambitions, featuring precise maneuvers and crucial testing to certify the capsule for routine NASA missions.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner capsule flew its first crew of astronauts to orbit on Wednesday from Florida in a much-delayed test mission to the International Space Station, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The CST-100 Starliner, with astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew are headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS) following years of technical problems, delays and a successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. The rocket's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into sunny skies from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe rocket's upper stage separated from its core booster about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. On its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to push itself into orbit, kicking off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Boeing intends for Starliner - seeded with NASA funding - to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\n\"This is another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA,\" the agency's administrator Bill Nelson told a press conference. The mission is a test flight required before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut missions. Now in space, the capsule will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth, among other flight objectives.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told reporters that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\" \"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... It's been a long time coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nBoeing shares closed up 0.7%. Last-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch.\n\nThe seven-seat Starliner's inaugural crew includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nBOEING AMBITIONS Boeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit, and later to the moon under NASA's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner, which like Crew Dragon is reusable, would compete head-to-head with the SpaceX capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. \"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\nBoeing intends to build two Starliner capsules that can carry out NASA astronaut missions, and possibly more for private spaceflight missions, depending on commercial demand, Nappi said. That demand is driven by government space agencies and early plans from other companies, such as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, to build privately run space stations whose development NASA is funding to replace the aging ISS in 2030. Crew Dragon has flown nine NASA astronaut missions to the ISS and four private customer missions.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bezos"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/05_06_2024_20_06_07_9776435.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2759, "textEnd": 2764}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Atlas V, the flight's rocket manufactured by United Launch Alliance, has flown missions since 2002 with a 100 percent success rate, but this is its first mission with astronauts.\n\n\"The engineering team has evaluated the vehicle is not in a configuration where we can proceed with flight today,\" an official in Mission Control said in a callout broadcast on NASA Television roughly two hours and one minute before the scheduled launch at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0024 GMT May 7).\n\nRead more: Boeing Starliner team delays 1st historic astronaut launch due to rocket issue\n\nNASA will hold a press conference on tonight's Boeing Starliner astronaut launch scrub at 10:30 p.m. EDT (0230 May 7 GMT). You'll be able to watch it live at the top of this page at start time.\n\n\"NASA, Boeing, and United Launch Alliance will host a news conference at 10:30 p.m. EDT to discuss Monday's scrubbed launch attempt of the agency's Crew Flight Test due to a faulty oxygen relief valve observation on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Centaur second stage,\" NASA officials wrote in an update. \"NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams exited the Starliner spacecraft at Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and returned to astronaut crew quarters.\"\n\nUntied Launch Alliance CEO Tory Bruno told reporters late Monday that ULA engineers are studying a \"buzzing\" liquid oxygen pressure relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage to determine if it needs to be replaced -- a finding that will determine when the next launch try of Boeing's 1st Starliner astronaut mission could fly.\n\nDuring tonight's scrubbed launch, ULA engineers detected that the valve was \"buzzing\" - rapidly opening and closing repeatedly - and ultimately called off the launch. While ULA has seen the valve issue on previous uncrewed satellite launches, the flight rules for Starliner's crewed test forbid cycling the valve to fix it with astronauts aboard.\n\nIf the wonky valve needs to be replaced, the earliest Starliner could launch its Crew Flight Test mission would be Sunday, May 12, Bruno said. If not, the mission could potentially aim for Tuesday, May 7, at 10:11 p.m. ET or Friday, May 10, at 9 pm ET.\n\nEngineers are expected to know more on the road ahead for Starliner and the Atlas V early Tuesday.\n\nIt will take a few days to work through the valve issue that scrubbed the first astronaut mission of Boeing's Starliner capsule, a test mission to the International Space Station called Crew Flight Test (CFT).\n\nCFT was supposed to launch on Monday night (May 6). That attempt was called off about two hours before the planned liftoff, however, due to an issue with a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank in the upper stage of Starliner's rocket ride, a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V. Early on Tuesday morning (May 7), NASA announced that launch teams need more time to troubleshoot the issue. The earliest that CFT could launch is now Friday night (May 10), at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT on May 11).\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will have to wait another 10 days for their launch to the International Space Station (ISS). United Launch Alliance (ULA) is moving forward with the replacement of a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank in the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage, which caused a scrub of Monday night's (May 6) Starliner launch. Monday's attempt to launch Starliner's crewed flight test (CFT) was called off about two ours before the scheduled liftoff, and initially retargeted a new launch date of May 10.\n\nNow, ULA will roll Starliner and its Atlas V launch vehicle back to the company's vertical integration facility tomorrow (May 8), where the second stage valve will be replaced, NASA announced in a blog post. The May 17 launch attempt is scheduled for an instantaneous launch window at 6:16 p.m. EDT (1016 GMT).\n\nThe first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is just three days away, if current timelines hold.\n\nStarliner's first launch attempt on May 6 was delayed due to a valve issue on its rocket ride. United Launch Alliance rolled its Atlas V rocket back to an assembly building at Cape Canaveral Space Force to replace the valve on May 8.\n\nThe next launch attempt is now scheduled for 6:16 p.m. EDT (2216 GMT) on Friday (May 17).

You can tune in live on our website, and keep following for updates on the situation.\n\nBoeing and ULA are moving progressing toward a June 1 launch of the first crewed flight test (CFT) of the Starliner spacecraft. Liftoff atop an Atlas V rocket, from ULA's Launch Complex-41, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, is scheduled for this Saturday, at 12:25 p.m. EDT (1625 GMT). According to a May 28 update from Boeing and ULA, Saturday's forecast currently shows a 90 percent chance of favorable weather conditions Starliner's upcoming launch window.\n\nAccording to the most recent forecast on May 31, there is still a 90% chance of favorable weather for the first Crew Flight Test of Boeing's new Starliner spacecraft.\n\nStarliner will liftoff atop an Atlas V rocket from ULA's Launch Complex-41, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Suni Williams will ride Starliner to the International Space Station.\n\n\"High pressure dominates the Central Florida weather, bringing breezy, easterly winds and dry, stable air to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station for the launch opportunity,\" United Launch Alliance (ULA) wrote on its website on Friday (May 31).\n\nLaunch is scheduled for this Saturday, June 1, at 12:25 p.m. EDT (1625 GMT).

They will make the short drive to United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Launch Copmlex-41(LC-41) to board Starliner ahead of the12:25 p.m. EDT (1625 GMT) instantaneous launch window. The trip to orbit will take approximately 31 minutes, with Starliner's service module executing the spacecraft's final orbital insertion burn. NASA is livestreaming today's launch activities, which you can watch here, at Space.com\n\nNow less than three hours before liftoff, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are strapped into Boeing's Starliner spacecraft ahead of the scheduled launch for the Crewed Flight Test (CFT) mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The pair will continue their prelaunch checklist before the hatch to Starliner will be shut and sealed as the countdown to liftoff ticks away.\n\nTwo valves associated with propellant loading ground support systems, responsible in part for topping off propellant in the liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks in the Atlas Centaur second stage, are experiencing an apparent communications issue between with launch control, causing mission operators to begin assessment for a corrective action. With two hours before liftoff, the decision was made to cease topping off the tanks in the rocket's second stage as the problem is worked out. Mission operators are testing a redundancy system in order to circumvent the problem.\n\nToday's launch is scheduled for an instantaneous liftoff window at 12:25 p.m. EDT (1625 GMT). Should the valve problem persist to the point that window becomes unviable, backup attempts are scheduled for tomorrow, June 5 and June 6.\n\nPropellant topping has resumed for the liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks inside the Atlas Centaur upper stage. After testing a fix, engineers determined the issue was with the primary telemetry stream, not the valves themselves, and decided to switch the valve data stream to a redundant system. Now, as the countdown clock continues, mission operators are working to close the Starliner hatch ahead of launch.\n\nThe closeout crew for Boeing's first crewed Starliner launch on an Atlas V rocket is leaving the launch pad after closing the Starliner hatch and moving its Crew Access Arm clear of the capsule.\n\nStarliner and its Atlas V rocket sit atop Space Launch Complex-41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida with liftoff still targeted for 12:25 p.m. EDT. We are just over 30 minutes away from launch, with the weather forecast to be 90% GO at launch time.\n\nStarliner CFT astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams have closed their Boeing spacesuit helmets for launch as they entire their final 20 minutes before liftoff.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance flight controllers reported an errant temperature sensor reading in a sensor that won't be needed for launch, so it's been deactivated a bit earlier than planned and poses no issue for liftoff. The launch remains on track for 12:25 pm ET (1625 GMT).\n\nStarliner CFT commander Butch Wilmore has reported a suit fan warning light and launch controllers are now working to swap suit fan systems to a backup, with the crew told to open their helmet visors, even as they are less than 11 minutes to launch.\n\nThe Starliner Crew Access Arm has been moved clear of the Starliner capsule. Meanwhile, the flight control team appears to have cleared the spacesuit fan glitch and CFT astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams have closed their visors for launch once more.\n\nStarliner's launch director has called a hold at the T-3 minutes, 50 seconds mark, likely scrubbing today's launch attempt due to its instantaneous window.\n\nWe're awaiting word on the exact nature of the hold, although audio from Launch Control did state that a launch control switch was not ready. Awaiting details\n\nStarliner CFT launch control reports that the Starliner spacecraft is back on external power while the countdown is halted at T-3 minutes, 50 seconds.\n\nThe Crew Access Arm has been swiveled back to the Starliner capsule.\n\nIf Starliner is unable to launch today, Boeing does have a backup day on Sunday, June 2, at 12:03 p.m. EDT (1603 GMT) if ULA and Boeing are able to clear the issue in time.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance has called an official scrub while engineers work to understand why a Ground Launch Sequencer called an automatic hold 3 minutes and 50 seconds before liftoff.\n\nThere will be no Starliner launch today.\n\nBoeing and ULA may attempt another launch try on Sunday, June 2, if they can clear the issue in time.\n\nFollowing today's scrub of Boeing's first crewed Starliner launch, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have now exited their spacecraft. After safing the launch vehicle and ground infrastructure, mission operators configured the launch tower at LC-41 to reopen Starliner's hatch and assist the astronauts' egress from the space capsule. They have now been transported back to their quarters at the Kennedy Space Center's Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building, remaining in quarantine as they await Starliner's next launch attempt.\n\nRelated: Launch of Boeing's 1st Starliner astronaut test flight aborted minutes before liftoff (video)\n\nTory Bruno, CEO of the United Launch Alliance, told reporters that a faulty computer card appears to have led to today's Starliner launch abort minutes before liftoff. The card is in one of several computers that form the ground launch sequencer system that governs the final phase of its Atlas V rocket countdown. Solving the problem may be as simple as just replacing the computer card, which can be done once pad crews can safely approach the pad after the Atlas V has been emptied of propellant and made safe, a process that will take several hours.\n\nIf the fix is that simple, then Starliner's next launch will be set for Sunday, July 2, at 12:03 p.m. EDT (1603 GMT), with NASA's livestream of the launch beginning around 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT). NASA's Steve Stitch said the agency will make an announcement later Saturday afternoon or evening on the launch plan.\n\nMeanwhile, the team is working hard despite the setback of a launch abort today, Stitch added.\n\n\"It's disappointing. Everybody's a little disappointed but you kind of roll your sleeves up and get right back to work.\"\n\nBoeing's next attempt to launch its first Starliner astronaut mission will occur no earlier than June 5, NASA officials said this afternoon.\n\nIn an emailed statement to reporters, NASA said that the agency, Boeing and the United Launch Alliance will skip a launch opportunity on June 2 and await the next window on June 5. Liftoff is now set for Wednesday, June 5, at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 GMT).\n\n\"Saturday's launch was to carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to and from the International Space Station scrubbed due to an observation of a ground launch sequencer. The system was unsuccessful in verifying the sequencer's necessary redundancy,\" NASA officials wrote in an update.\n\n\"NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) are forgoing a Crew Flight Test launch attempt Sunday, June 2, to give the team additional time to assess a ground support equipment issue at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Space Launch Complex-41 in Florida,\" NASA added. \"ULA will assess the ground support equipment overnight, and NASA will provide an update June 2 on next steps for the flight. The next available launch opportunities are Wednesday, June 5, and Thursday, June 6.\"\n\nThe first crewed mission aboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft is proceeding towards launch on Wednesday (June 5) after a computer issue in the ground launch sequencer system scrubbed the previous launch attempt with just minutes left in the countdown.\n\n\"Teams at NASA and Boeing Space confirmed on Monday that the Starliner spacecraft, ULA Atlas V rocket, and ground support equipment are healthy and ready for the 10:52 a.m. ET June 5 launch of the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test,\" NASA's Commercial Crew program wrote on X on Monday (June 3).\n\nThe U.S. Space Force's Space Launch Delta 45 has predicted a 90% chance of favorable weather at launch, which occurs at 10:52 a.m. ET (1452 GMT).

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are headed to the International Space Station.\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- After years of stumbles and delays, Boeing has finally launched astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA.\n\nIt's the first flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station.\n\nNASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of empty test flights.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nTHE CAPSULE\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner planes.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed. Wednesday's launch was the third try with astronauts; two earlier countdowns were scuttled by rocket-related issues.\n\nTHE CREW\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts.\n\nTHE TEST FLIGHT\n\nStarliner blasted off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's the first time astronauts have ridden an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Now 62 years later, Wednesday's launch was the 100th for the top-of-the-line Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station with its seven residents on Thursday. Starliner will remain docked for just over a week, undergoing checkouts before landing in the American West.\n\nSTARLINER VS. DRAGON\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX's capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Plans called for Wilmore and Williams to briefly take manual control to test out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was delivering supplies to the space station, and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing has a more traditional \"astrovan.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks, but these rides are separate from NASA's dedicated six-month missions.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will attempt to deliver cargo to the station later this year, before accepting passengers. It is due to launch on ULA's new Vulcan rocket, the eventual successor to the Atlas V.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

He is a veteran of two spaceflights.Williams will be the pilot of the mission and has been a NASA astronaut since 1998. She is a veteran of two space missions.Both astronauts went back home after the mission's many delays but returned to Central Florida last week for the scrubbed June 1 launch attempt. Now, they remain in quarantine at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.The two will spend eight days on the International Space Station if all goes as planned.Why was the mission delayed?When the original scrub was called on May 6, officials cited the cause as a mechanical issue involving \"a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage\" on the Atlas V rocket.Officials rolled the rocket back to its Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and successfully replaced the pressure regulation valve, which prevents the oxygen tank from building up too much pressure.The launch was moved to May 17 to allow for more testing but was pushed back to May 21 when Boeing said Starliner teams were working to resolve a small helium leak detected in the spacecraft's service module.Then, the launch was pushed back to May 25 when officials announced they once again needed more time to resolve the issue.Eventually, officials said they would be foregoing that May 25 launch attempt completely.The launch was indefinitely on hold until officials said they were prepared for a June 1 launch attempt.Last week, mission partners polled \"go\" to proceed with plans for that launch and rolled the Atlas V rocket out to the pad for the first time since the original scrub.On Saturday, the countdown was going smoothly, when suddenly, officials scrubbed the launch just minutes before takeoff. The sudden scrub was due to the failure of some ground support equipment.ULA said their teams worked overnight to identify the problem and were able to replace a faulty power supply system in their ground operations computers.At last check, ULA said the system is now performing normally following a number of functionality checks.

Now on its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that starts its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nStarliner will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told a news conference that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\"\n\n\"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... We're on orbit with Butch and Suni, it's been a longtime coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nBoeing shares were up less than 1% in early afternoon trade.\n\n\"Starliner ascends to the heavens,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the U.S. space agency.\n\nNelson called the launch \"a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nBOEING AMBITIONS\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of it if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering manually en route to ISS.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another step in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

This is the third attempt at a launch for the spacecraft, which is carrying two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThe spacecraft lifted off at 10:52 a.m. ET, carried by a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. On board the Starliner are NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will arrive at the ISS for docking Thursday. The launch can be viewed below:\n\nNASA's Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test Launch - June 5, 2024 (Official NASA Broadcast)\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task -- but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThis is the first crewed test flight of the Starliner, which has had a troubled development period with repeated problems over the last five years. In the last month, there have been several attempts to make the launch, but there were problems, including an issue with the rocket and a helium leak on the spacecraft, which forced the launch to be called off.\n\nNow, however, the Starliner has launched as planned with a smooth liftoff, as seen in this footage:\n\nNASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test: Liftoff from NASA's Kennedy Space Center!\n\nThe astronauts will travel for around 24 hours, and should arrive at the ISS at 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday June 6. This makes Williams the first woman to be on board a first crewed test flight of a new spacecraft.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nIf docking goes as planned, NASA will now have two options for ferrying astronauts between Earth and the ISS: the Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon.

The Starliner capsule took off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 10:52 a.m. ET. If successful, the two are expected to return to Earth in approximately 10 days.\n\nNASA and Boeing both confirmed on Monday that the capsule, rocket and ground support equipment were ready for the launch after two previously aborted attempts. In May, there was an issue with an oxygen relief valve that delayed and subsequently led to the cancellation of the first launch attempt. Then, on June 1, the United Launch Alliance crew found another issue with a rocket, which halted the second attempt.\n\nFollowing the launch, the Starliner capsule carrying Wilmore and Williams detached from booster rockets, using its own engines to take the pair to the International Space Station. Wilmore and Williams helped develop the capsule.\n\nThe two astronauts will stay at the space station to test the Starliner spacecraft for certification -- potentially putting Boeing in competition with SpaceX.

(Joe Skipper/Reuters)\n\nBoeing's third attempt to launch two astronauts into space was successful Wednesday at 10:52 a.m. ET., marking the company's final test to become a space shuttle for NASA.\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped CST-100 Starliner capsule was at a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket from Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nA May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nNASA said its teams worked overnight to assess the ground support equipment at the launch pad that encountered issues during the countdown and identified an issue with a ground power supply within one of the chassis. The supply provides power to a subset of computer cards controlling various system functions.\n\nThe chassis containing the faulty ground power unit was removed, visually inspected, and replaced with a spare chassis, the space agency said.\n\nThe crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey are scheduled to stay for one week at the International Space Station.\n\nMr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Mr. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Ms. Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the space station on Thursday and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station.\n\nTwo years ago, Boeing made its first trip to the orbital laboratory on an unmanned mission. Parachute and other issues were later discovered, delaying Starliner's crew debut even further.\n\nIn 2019, Boeing attempted to launch an unmanned capsule to the space station for the first time, but the attempt was unsuccessful due to software problems.\n\nToday's launch was a final test for the company before NASA can certify it and hire it as a space shuttle for astronauts, a position Boeing was pressed to get after failures regarding its 737 MAX aircraft and rival SpaceX's successful attempts at the space station.\n\nBoeing's Starliner venture is already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nBoeing was manufacturing modules for the ISS, as well as for rockets flying to the moon, and it was the first time it had built a whole spacecraft.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft -- which NASA funded -- designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending crew members to orbit in the space station from U.S. soil.\n\nMr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams are due to join the International Space Station's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest -- a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nBoeing made a $4.2 billion fixed-price contract with NASA, which likes the idea of having two transportation providers for its astronauts to the space station, which retires in 2030.\n\nSpaceX's Dragon Crew is scheduled for launch on Thursday. It will be a test for its reusable Starship satellite launcher and moon lander.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_support_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ground support equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/id997813-2024-06-05T151535Z_1_LYNXMPEK540O9_RTROPTP_4_SPACE-EXPLORATION-BOEING-STARLINER.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 639, "textEnd": 644}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The ULA team identified an issue with a single ground power supply within one of the three redundant chassis that provides power to a subset of computer cards controlling various system functions, including the card responsible for the stable replenishment topping valves for the Centaur upper stage. All three of these chassis are required to enter the terminal phase of the launch countdown to ensure crew safety.\n\nOn Sunday, the chassis containing the faulty ground power unit was removed, visually inspected, and replaced with a spare chassis. No signs of physical damage were observed. A full failure analysis of the power unit will be performed to better understand root cause. Meanwhile, ULA has completed functional checkouts of the new chassis and the cards, and all hardware is performing normally.\n\nThe mission managers have opted for the next launch attempt on June 5. The U.S. Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron predicts a 90% chance of favorable weather conditions, with the cumulus cloud rule being the primary weather concern. Another opportunity is available at 10:29 a.m., Thursday, June 6.\n\nNASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Suni Williams, the crew of the flight test who will be the first to launch aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, remain in quarantine at NASA's Kennedy Space Center and will take part in pilot proficiency and other training activities leading up to launch.\n\nYesterdays photo is poignant when reviewing the courage necessary to endure the tension of such an incredible mission.\n\nAt the last few minutes the astronauts' nerves are beginning to show.

(NASA photo)\n\nFollowing is a report from Boeing:\n\nNASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams continue working remaining open tasks in preparation for the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than 4:43 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing.\n\nOn May 11, the ULA team successfully replaced a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage. The team also performed re-pressurization and system purges, and tested the new valve, which performed normally.\n\nStarliner teams are working to resolve a small helium leak detected in the spacecraft's service module traced to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster. Helium is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire and is not combustible or toxic.\n\nNASA and Boeing are developing spacecraft testing and operational solutions to address the issue. As a part of the testing, Boeing will bring the propulsion system up to flight pressurization just as it does prior to launch, and then allow the helium system to vent naturally to validate existing data and strengthen flight rationale. Mission teams also completed a thorough review of the data from the May 6 launch attempt and are not tracking any other issues.\n\nThe Atlas V and Starliner remain in the Vertical Integration Facility at Space Launch Complex-41 on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, still in preflight quarantine, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend extra time with their families as prelaunch operations progress. The duo will fly back to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the coming days.\n\nULA's Boeing Starliner launch for NASA astronauts delayed again adding to the $1.5 billion over budget\n\nAn Atlas V N22 rocket will launch Boeing's Starliner on CFT. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nStarliner's mission carrying two NASA astronauts had been scheduled for liftoff from Florida last week until a technical issue with its Atlas 5 rocket prompted a delay to Friday, May 17. The launch of Starliner is now set for no earlier than 4:43 p.m. Tuesday, May 21 at 4:43 p.m. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, reportedly returned to Houston to be with their families and now plan to return to Florida in the coming days\n\nThis hitch in the latest postponement only compounds the expense for a program years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nBoeing stated that a small helium leak was detected in the spacecraft's service module that is the disposable module that sits below the spacecraft and contains the thrusters and launch abort engines.\n\nThe helium leak was found to be coming from a \"flange on a single reaction control system thruster.\" While helium is not reactive, it is used within thrusters to assist in firing. In order to ensure the safety of the spacecraft, the Boeing team states they plan to fully investigate the leak and that means bringing Starliner's propulsion system to the state seen before launch.\n\nBoeing added that they aren't currently tracking any other issues with the spacecraft.\n\nOriginally set for May 6, the launch was scrubbed when a faulty oxygen valve on the Atlas V was discovered with almost two hours left until launch. The crew was in the process of getting in the spacecraft when teams called off the launch to investigate the valve.\n\n\"And every now and again, in rare occasions, a valve like that can get into a position where it's just off the seat. Its temperature, its stiffness, everything is just right. And it'll flutter. Or it'll buzz -- in this case -- in cycle,\" ULA President Tory Bruno said during a press conference which followed the May 6 night scrub.\n\n\"We've seen that before,\" said Bruno. \"What you would typically do is activate the solenoid that forces the valve closed -- cycling the valve, if you will -- then you turn that on and let it return.\"\n\nNASA's statement regarding the scrub indicated that the two astronauts flying the CFT mission, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain at the Kennedy Space Center in pre-flight quarantine for this latest delay.\n\nThe delay enables United Launch Alliance to return the rocket to its Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) hangar near the pad to replace a liquid oxygen pressure regulation valve in the Centaur. That valve started oscillating after the stage was loaded with liquid oxygen, creating a buzzing noise noticed by launch pad crews.\n\nIn NASA's statement about the new delay, the agency said that while the valve vibration was dampened once the valve was closed after the scrub, that vibration returned twice while propellant was being offloaded from the rocket.\n\n\"After evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve,\" NASA stated.\n\nAt a briefing after the May 6 scrub, Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said the concern was that the vibration could have caused the valve to approach its rated life of 200,000 cycles. The valve was vibrating at 40 hertz, he noted.\n\nBruno continued that engineers would examine if those vibrations involved full cycles of the valve, and ULA would have to replace the valve. However, if the valve was only partially moving, then it was possible the valve was not nearing its design life and could be retained. Officials said at the briefing that they could try to launch again the next day, but later revised the launch date to the next opportunity, May 10, before this latest delay.\n\nNASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test now is targeted to launch no earlier than 6:16 p.m. EDT Friday, May 17, to the International Space Station. Following a thorough data review completed on Tuesday, United Launch Alliance decided to remove and replace a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage.\n\nULA plans to roll the rocket, with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, back to its Vertical Integration Facility on Wednesday, May 8, to begin the replacement. The ULA team will perform leak checks and functional checkouts in support of the next launch attempt.\n\nThe oscillating behavior of the valve during prelaunch operations ultimately resulted in mission teams calling a launch scrub on May 6. After the ground and flight crew safely egressed from Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) last night, the ULA team successfully commanded the valve closed and the oscillations were temporarily dampened. The oscillations then re-occurred twice during fuel removal operations. After evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve.\n\nMission managers discussed the details leading to the decision to scrub the May 6 launch opportunity during a news conference shortly after the call at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will remain at crew quarters in health stabilization until the next launch opportunity. The duo will be the first to launch aboard Starliner to the space station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew, we scrubbed the Crew Flight Test (CFT) launch attempt today due to an observation on a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage. The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment, so we are targeting the next launch attempt no earlier than Friday, May 10.\n\nPilot ingress. Now boarding Starliner is CFT mission pilot Suni Williams, a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights as a long-duration resident aboard the space station. Williams is from Needham, Massachusetts, and earned a physical science degree from the U.S. Naval Academy and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology. She is married and is a dog mom.\n\nULA's Launch director Tom Heter III has scrubbed tonight's Starliner launch. Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew, we scrubbed the Crew Flight Test (CFT) launch attempt today due to an observation on a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage. The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment, so we are targeting the next launch attempt no earlier than Friday, May 10.\n\nStarliner's history has numerous scrubs. Boeing launched an orbital test flight without astronauts twice because of a botched first attempt in 2019 that failed to reach the ISS. They were also set to launch Williams and Wilmore last summer, but Boeing managers revealed new issues with the spacecraft after further examining data from Starliner's OFT orbital flight test in May 2022.\n\nThe launch was halted due to an issue that cropped up with a valve on the spacecraft's rocket two hours before launch. Mission controllers declared a launch \"scrub\" after an anomaly was detected on an oxygen valve on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket\n\nA new launch date has not yet been announced.\n\nThe official crew portrait celebrates the astronauts of the CFT mission.

The mission is planned to lift off on Monday, May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The launch is planned for 10:34 p.m. EDT. Today's forecast shows a 95 percent chance of favorable weather conditions for launch.\n\nLaunch Forecast Summary:\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints: 5%\n\nPrimary concerns: Cumulus Cloud Rule\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints for 24-hour delay: 5%\n\nThe names of Wilmore and Williams will soon join Glenn, Carpenter, Schirra and Cooper as pioneering astronauts to launch atop Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe first four Americans to orbit the Earth during NASA's Project Mercury all rode early Atlas boosters to place their single-seat capsules into space. Now 60 years later, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will launch astronauts using the latest generation of Atlas V rockets for NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 1962, the Atlas 109-D rocket launched John Glenn, the first American ever to circle the planet in space, and his Friendship 7 capsule. His three orbits made Glenn a national hero.\n\nThe Atlas 107-D rocket launched Scott Carpenter and Aurora 7 on May 24, 1962, to orbit the Earth three times. Sigma 7 and Walter Schirra were launched by Atlas 113-D on Oct. 3, 1962, to complete six orbits. And Atlas 130-D launched Faith 7 and Gordon Cooper on May 15, 1963 for a 34-hour voyage in orbit, completing the Mercury missions.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be the first crew members to fly aboard Starliner on its Crew Flight Test (CFT). Wilmore and Williams, both Naval aviators, military test pilots and former commanders of the International Space Station, have worked closely with Boeing to develop the Starliner spacecraft and ULA on the features required to carry crew.\n\nAtlas V will launch Starliner on its journey to rendezvous and dock with the space station, where the two astronauts will live and work for about a week before undocking and returning to Earth to land at a site in the Western U.S.\n\nWilmore, commander of the CFT mission, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights to the space station. Wilmore is from Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, and earned degrees from Tennessee Technological University in electrical engineering and the University of Tennessee in aviation systems. He is married with two daughters.\n\nWilmore has accumulated more than 8,000 flight hours and 663 carrier landings, all in tactical jet aircraft, and is a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School. During his tenure as a fleet Naval officer and aviator, Wilmore completed four operational deployments, flying the A-7E and F/A 18 aircraft from the decks of the USS Forrestal, USS Kennedy, USS Enterprise and the USS Eisenhower aircraft carriers.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in July 2000, Wilmore was assigned technical duties representing the Astronaut Office on all propulsion systems, including the space shuttle main engines, solid rocket motors and external tank, and also led the astronaut support team that traveled to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida, in support of launch and landing operations. To date Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nHe completed his first flight as pilot of space shuttle Atlantis on STS-129, logging 11 days in space in November 2009. This was the 31st shuttle flight to the station. During the mission, the crew delivered two Express Logistics Carrier racks and about 30,000 pounds of replacement parts to maintain the station's proper orientation in space.\n\nWilmore's second flight was as a long-duration resident aboard the station. From September to November 2014, he served as flight engineer for Expedition 41 and then as commander of Expedition 42 from November 2014 to March 2015 totaling nearly six months in space. Wilmore performed three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. In addition, he completed a spacewalk to replace a failed voltage regulator. Wilmore and two Roscosmos cosmonauts launched to the space station in a Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and returned to Earth safely to touch down in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan after the 167-day mission.\n\nWilliams, pilot of the CFT mission, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights as a long-duration resident aboard the space station. Williams is from Needham, Massachusetts, and earned a physical science degree from the U.S. Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology. She is married and is a dog mom.\n\nWilliams has accumulated 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft. She received her designation as a Basic Diving Officer and later was designated a Naval Aviator. Williams was selected for United States Naval Test Pilot School, and after graduation she was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer. She went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an Instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and the school's Safety Officer.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on 7 spacewalks. Williams worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew. After her first flight, she served as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office. She then performed another long-duration mission that included serving as station commander.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 from December 2006 to June 2007, launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the station. While onboard, Williams established a world record for females at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight.\n\nWilliams launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Soyuz with a Roscosmos cosmonaut and Japanese astronaut for Expedition 32/33 from July to November 2012. Williams spent 127 days in space conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory. She performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repaired an ammonia leak on a station radiator.\n\nULA's L-2 report states that everything continues to progress towards the ULA Atlas V launch carrying the first crewed Boeing Starliner spacecraft for NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP).\n\nThe mission is planned to lift off on Monday, May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

The mission is planned to lift off on Monday, May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The launch is planned for 10:34 p.m. EDT.\n\nLaunch visibility\n\nWondering if you can see the Atlas V launch? This visibility map shows when and where your best chances are to see the rocket as it lifts off Monday at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 UTC) from Cape Canaveral.\n\nToday's forecast shows a 90 percent chance of favorable weather conditions for launch.\n\nLaunch Forecast Summary:\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints: 10%\n\nPrimary concerns: Detached Anvil\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints for 24-hour delay: 10%\n\nUnited Launch Alliance (ULA) uses a unique version of its Atlas V countdown for human spaceflight missions, in the name of safety, to complete hazardous fueling operations and then place the rocket in a quiescent state before the astronauts board.\n\nLaunch of the Crew Flight Test (CFT) is planned for May 6 at 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 UTC) from Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. A live countdown blog and launch webcast in collaboration with Boeing and NASA will be available on the ULA website.\n\nThe Atlas V launch countdown begins 11 hours and 20 minutes before liftoff and features a four-hour planned, built-in hold at the T-minus four-minute mark for crew ingress into Starliner.\n\nThe CFT astronauts will board Starliner after Atlas V is readied. Photo by NASA\n\nOverseeing the start of the countdown is the \"Preps Team\" of console operators inside the Advanced Spaceflight Operations Center. Launch Conductor Dillon Rice will orchestrate the countdown procedures from the Launch Control Center while ULA Launch Director James Whelan is at the helm in the Mission Director's Center.\n\nThis initial phase of the count will be spent powering up the rocket, running system checkouts, completing standard pre-launch testing and performing final preparations on the rocket and pad systems for propellant-loading operations.\n\nThe Preps Team will lead the countdown through its first five hours, then a shift change occurs to hand each station to the \"Tanking & Launch Team\" of console operators. These counterparts take responsibilities for the next six hours through liftoff, led by ULA Chief Launch Conductor Doug Lebo and ULA Launch Director Tom Heter.\n\nThe shift handover happens during the planned, hour-long countdown hold at T-minus two hours. Just before the hold concludes, readiness polls are conducted to authorize the start of cryogenic tanking. With the pad cleared of all personnel, the hazardous operation of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen filling the Atlas V rocket's stages for launch is performed.\n\nOnce fueling is completed and the rocket's tanks placed into stable replenishment, the countdown enters the extended hold at T-minus four minutes. The Blue Team is dispatched to the pad's 200-foot-tall (61-m) Crew Access Tower (CAT) to ready the White Room and Starliner crew module for arrival of the astronauts, assist the crew into their seats and then close the hatch for flight.\n\nThe team is comprised of eight specialists from ULA and Boeing. Dane Drefke, ULA's mechanical operations lead engineer serves as the Blue Team Leader (BTL). He is in charge of the Blue Team's activities and has an obligation to ensure everyone's safety.\n\nULA's three representatives on the Blue Team begin activities by walking across the 48-foot-long (14.6-m) retractable catwalk extending from the CAT to the White Room. Their duties include verifying the White Room is safe for personnel to enter, establishing access to the capsule, deploying the environmental seal between the pad and spacecraft and setting up access platforms.\n\nThe ULA members then switch places with five Boeing technicians, waiting in the wings on the CAT, led by Boeing's Pad Team Leader Nate Keyek-Franssen for assisting the crew into the spacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts, commander Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams, receive a final weather briefing and don their spacesuits before leaving NASA's Crew Quarters in the Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building at the Kennedy Space Center. Departure to board Boeing's Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV) occurs about three hours and 20 minutes before launch.\n\nThe trip to SLC-41 will take about 25 minutes, with the CTV arriving at the base of the CAT approximately two hours and 55 minutes before launch. The astronauts will take the elevator to Level 12 while the CTV convoy departs the pad and heads to the safe fallback area.\n\nOnce crew ingress is completed, another weather briefing will be held 90 minutes before launch, to inform mission managers that conditions are suitable for the Blue Team to close the Starliner hatch and proceed with the countdown. Pending a go, Boeing technicians will close the hatch and perform cabin leak checks to verify the integrity of the seal.\n\nThe Crew Access Arm enables the astronauts to board the spacecraft. Photo by United Launch\n\nAllianceBoeing personnel then depart the White Room so that the ULA technicians can retract access platforms and deflate the environmental seal around the spacecraft to prepare the Crew Access Arm for rotation to the launch position later in the countdown. The entire Blue Team departs the pad about 35 minutes before liftoff.\n\nThe access arm will be hydraulically swung away from the spacecraft 11 minutes prior to launch. The process will take about two minutes to reach the stowed position against the CAT. If the need arises, the arm can be redeployed in less than 15 seconds by dropping counterweights.\n\nSeven minutes before launch, Lebo performs the readiness polling of the launch team members, Ascent Flight Director Mike Lammers in Houston and the Starliner crew before Heter gives final permission to launch. The countdown clocks resume four minutes before liftoff to put the rocket on internal power, pressurize its tanks, arm systems and start the main engine.\n\nThe daily available launch window is instantaneous, meaning there is only an instant in time each day for launch to occur. This split second happens when the orbital plane of the International Space Station passes over the launch pad, thereby enabling Atlas V to put Starliner on the proper trajectory to intercept the station for rendezvous and docking.\n\nThe main engine and twin solid rocket boosters generate 1.6 million pounds (7.1 mega-Newtons) of thrust to begin the voyage of Wilmore and Williams. The commander will call out \"roll program\" as Atlas V clears the tower to place the astronauts heads-up for their ride to space.\n\nThe main engine will ease back for a period of deep throttling, going into its throttle bucket during the region of maximum aerodynamic stresses on the rocket in the dense lower atmosphere and to lessen the G-loads on the crew.\n\nThe solid rocket boosters burn for a minute-and-a-half, followed by the main engine revving back to full throttle, to triple the rocket's velocity through the remaining first stage of flight.\n\nJust over two minutes after liftoff, Atlas V will have burned nearly 500,000 pounds (227,000 kg) of fuel and weigh only half of what it did at launch.\n\nAn illustration depicts Atlas V stagging during the launch of Starliner.\n\nFollowing the first stage engine shutdown, the Atlas V common core booster will jettison from the Centaur four minutes and 35 seconds after liftoff. The Centaur ignites both engines 10 seconds later at an altitude of approximately 60 nautical miles (111 km).\n\nThe Centaur burn will last just over seven minutes to deliver Starliner at the desired injection point for separation at T+plus 14 minutes, 55 seconds into a 98 by 39-nautical mile (181\u00d772-km) suborbital trajectory, inclined 51.6 degrees relative to the equator.\n\nAtlas V will launch northeasterly from Cape Canaveral, paralleling the Eastern Seaboard and crossing the North Atlantic to accelerate Starliner to 17,475 mph (28,123 kmph).\n\nFor Starliner missions, Atlas V takes a special trajectory to space that requires the Centaur upper stage to use two engines instead of one. The double-engine configuration allows the rocket to fly a flatter trajectory and ensure the spacecraft can execute an abort at any time to bring the astronauts back to Earth safely if a problem occurs.\n\nDual Engine Centaur also enables the customized flight profile for Starliner that features just a single burn and a limited acceleration rate to manage the G-force experienced by the astronauts aboard.\n\nAfter Centaur releases Starliner, the spacecraft employs the same operational procedure as the space shuttle, which also launched on suborbital trajectories, by performing an orbital-maneuvering engine firing to reach a stable orbit about 15 minutes after separation.\n\nULA's Starliner in countdown mode and Status Check for first human launch of NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams to ISS\n\nAtlas V will launch Boeing's Starliner with two NASA astronauts on the Crew Flight Test mission.

CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.\n\nOn the shoulders of Atlas, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will soon launch two NASA astronauts on the Crew Test Flight (CFT) to the International Space Station for NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\nUnited Launch Alliance (ULA) is readying the Atlas V rocket for the historic flight test that is targeted for launch on May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be the first crew members to fly aboard Starliner. Wilmore, the CFT commander, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights to the space station. Williams, serving as the CFT pilot, is also a retired Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights as a long-duration resident aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nStarliner arrives at the VIF. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nThis morning, Starliner traveled from Boeing's Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to ULA's Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) for connection to the Atlas V.\n\nULA's motorized payload transporter, adapted to carry Starliner, moved at a top speed of 5 mph, heading from the C3PF, a former space shuttle hangar, eastward to the beach and then southward to the launch site. The transporter deck also provided Starliner with environmental controls to keep its compartments in good health during the transport.\n\nApproaching the VIF, the transporter maneuvered up to the 30-story-tall building's doorway and parked. A four-point lifting sling, called the Handling Fixture Hoist Tool, was connected to the Starliner, for the overhead crane to carefully raise the spacecraft onto the Atlas V waiting inside the VIF aboard its Mobile Launch Platform (MLP).\n\nStarliner was positioned for mating to the Launch Vehicle Adapter (LVA) that serves as the spacecraft's cradle on the rocket during ascent. The LVA also features the aeroskirt structure that smooths the air over the combined payload and Atlas V for aerodynamic stability.\n\nNext up is the integrated systems test, a tip-to-tail electrical check of the 172-foot-tall (52-meter) Atlas V and Starliner stack.\n\nAtlas V and Starliner stand ready for CFT. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nThe MLP will move the rocket and spacecraft to the pad approximately two days prior to liftoff for final sequence of activities that include testing, fueling, boarding of the astronaut crew and launch.\n\nStarliner is a next-generation, autonomous spacecraft for safe and reliable crew and cargo transportation to and from low-Earth orbit destinations. For NASA missions to the orbiting laboratory, Starliner will carry up to four NASA-sponsored crew members and about 220 pounds of time-critical scientific research.\n\nCFT will reuse the Starliner crew module that flew the first OFT mission, named Calypso by Williams.\n\nFollowing a successful CFT mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying the Starliner spacecraft and systems for crew missions to the space station. Long-duration commercial crew rotation missions enable NASA to continue the important research and technology investigations taking place aboard the orbiting laboratory. Such research benefits people on Earth and lays the groundwork for future space exploration.\n\nUpdate to ULA's Starliner's first human launch of NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams to ISS\n\nLaunch Vehicle on Stand: Atlas V Starliner Crew Flight Test\n\nThe United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V booster arrives at the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) adjacent to Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nDaily routines and dress rehearsals keep everyone busy in preparation for the first launch of humans in an ULA Atlas V rocket to the ISS. Here's a peek at some of the proceedings that are taking place in beautiful Florida and the weather is picture perfect.\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch on May 6, 2024 at 10:34 p.m. EDT Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita (Suni) Williams on the Crew Flight Test (CFT).\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch on May 6, 2024 at 10:34 p.m. EDT Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita (Suni) Williams on the Crew Flight Test (CFT).\n\nFollowing separation from Atlas V, Starliner engines will burn taking it the rest of the way to orbit and on to the International Space Station. CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Go Atlas! Go Centaur! Go Starliner!\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts on the Crew Flight Test (CFT). Following separation from Atlas V, Starliner engines will burn taking it the rest of the way to orbit and on to the International Space Station. CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.\n\nCFT is the final test to demonstrate the full end-of-end capabilities of the Starliner system to deliver crews to and from the space station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The unique Atlas configuration for Starliner includes a dual-engine Centaur upper stage to deliver the performance needed to shape the trajectory for crew safety; a launch vehicle adapter that structurally attaches the Starliner to the Atlas V rocket for ascent; a 70-inch-long (1.8-m) aeroskirt to enhance the aerodynamic characteristics, stability and loads of the Atlas V; and an Emergency Detection System that provides an extra layer of safety for astronauts riding the reliable Atlas V. The Atlas V Starliner launch countdown features a four-hour planned, built-in hold at the T-minus 4-minute mark. This allows the rocket to be fueled and placed in a quiescent state before boarding of the astronauts into the spacecraft.\n\nCFT bridges the history of Atlas with today's rocket. The first orbital spaceflights of American astronauts in the 1960s were launched in Project Mercury by Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral. That legacy continues with Atlas V launching crews from U.S. soil.\n\nModified specifically for the Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, the Atlas V Starliner configuration does not include a payload fairing. Instead, the Starliner's insulated surfaces take the place of the fairing to protect the uncrewed spacecraft during ascent. The vehicle's height with the Boeing CST-100 Starliner is approximately 172 ft (52.4 meters).\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner is attached to the Atlas V using a launch vehicle adapter (LVA), which also includes an aeroskirt to reduce the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. The aeroskirt is jettisoned for improved performance following booster stage separation.\n\nThe Centaur second stage is 10 ft (3 meters) in diameter and 41.5 ft (12.6 meters) in length. Its propellant tanks are pressure-stabilized and constructed of corrosion-resistant stainless steel. Centaur is a cryogenic vehicle, fueled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Atlas V configuration for this mission is powered by dual RL10A-4-2 engines, each producing 22,600 lbs (100.5 kilo-Newtons) of thrust. The cryogenic tanks are insulated with a combination of helium-purged blankets, radiation shields and spray-on foam insulation (SOFI). The Centaur forward adapter (CFA) provides structural mountings for the fault-tolerant avionics system and electrical interfaces with the spacecraft. The Centaur also includes an Emergency Detection System (EDS) that monitors for critical hazards to detect an imminent or occurring failure. The EDS also provides critical in-flight data which supports jettison of the ascent cover and initiates CST-100 Starliner spacecraft separation.\n\nThe booster is 12.5 ft (3.81 meters) in diameter and 106.5 ft (32.4 meters) in length. The booster's tanks are structurally rigid and constructed of isogrid aluminum barrels, spun-formed aluminum domes and intertank skirts. Booster propulsion is provided by the RD-180 engine system (a single engine with two thrust chambers). The RD-180 burns RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly purified kerosene) and liquid oxygen and delivers 860,200 lbs (3.83 mega-Newtons) of thrust at sea level. Two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) generate the additional power required at liftoff, with each SRB providing 348,500 lbs (1.55 mega-Newtons) of thrust. The Centaur avionics system provides guidance, flight control and vehicle sequencing functions during the booster and Centaur phases of flight.\n\nSpace Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41), the East Coast home of the Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, employs a \"clean pad\" concept of operations to ready launch vehicles and payloads for ascent into space. The rocket elements are assembled atop a Mobile Launch Platform inside the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) located adjacent to the launch pad. The platform and fully stacked Atlas V then travel by rail approximately 1,800 feet northward from the VIF to the pad for the final countdown, fueling and liftoff. Complex 41 was constructed by the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s for the Titan rocket program. The site was rejuvenated in support of the Atlas V starting in the late 1990s.", "source": {"uri": "news.satnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.satnews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The CST-100 Starliner, carrying two astronauts, is headed to the International Space Station after overcoming years of technical delays. This mission tests Starliner's capability to safely transport crew members to and from orbit.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), following years of technical problems, delays and a 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into sunny skies from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Starliner will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts - Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams - to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. Boeing wrote on social media that Starliner \"has reached a safe, stable orbit on its Crew Flight Test\" and is headed to the space station.\n\n\"Starliner ascends to the heavens,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the U.S. space agency. Nelson called the launch \"a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer. The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth. BOEING AMBITIONS\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. The longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the agency's Artemis program. Starliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media. Although Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering manually en route to ISS.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another step in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nMore on Boeing: Boeing and its firefighters reach tentative agreement\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything seemed to go smoothly before and during liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nMore space launches: European-Japanese climate research satellite launched from California aboard SpaceX rocket\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"", "source":

The crew will spend the next 25 hours racing to catch up to the International Space Station.\n\nThe mission marks the first time the commercially-built capsule is carrying humans, with a scheduled docking to the station Thursday around 12:15 p.m. ET, with astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore as commander and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams serving as mission pilot.\n\nIt was the third launch attempt of Starliner. On Saturday, the countdown was halted with less than four minutes left. An issue with the flight computers that control launch was to blame. Launch provider ULA replaced a power supply on the system and cleared it for Wednesday's launch. It followed a launch attempt last month that was called off due to a misbehaving valve on the Atlas V rocket's upper stage Centaur.\n\nWhile fixing that issue, Boeing discovered another: a helium leak. The gas is used in Starliner's propulsion system. After a review of the data, NASA was confident Boeing could successfully fly the mission.\n\nWith all those issues resolved, and Starliner on its way to the space station, it appears this third try is indeed the charm. Now launched, Wilmore and Williams are taking Starliner on its maiden flight, putting the vehicle through its paces ahead of operational missions for NASA. After the Space Shuttle retired in 2011, NASA partnered with two commercial companies -- Boeing and SpaceX -- to ferry astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nBut Boeing has lagged behind its commercial space transportation counterpart SpaceX, which has flown nine missions for NASA already and another four private flights. An uncrewed Starliner mission in 2019 failed to reach the station, in part due to faulty flight computer code. A re-flight of the launch in 2022 was considered a success by NASA and Boeing, but issues were later discovered in the capsule's parachute systems.\n\nAn analysis also found tape used to manage the hundreds of feet of cabling within the spacecraft was flammable. Boeing fixed those issues and received NASA's go-ahead to launch the crew\n\nBut that first attempt to launch this crewed mission last month was scrubbed due to an issue with the rocket responsible for giving Starliner its big boost into space.\n\nWillmore and Williams will test key systems of Starliner as it docks with the space station, including life support and communication. While the spacecraft can essentially fly itself, the duo will test out manual controls of the vehicle as it approaches the orbiting outpost.\n\nThe crew will spend about a week aboard the station with a scheduled landing under a canopy of parachutes in the southwest U.S. Teams at NASA and Boeing will comb through the data from this flight before certifying the vehicle for operational mission. NASA plans to split astronaut flights between Boeing and SpaceX, with trips to the I.S.S. happening about every six months.", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maiden flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9510d4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4444x2333+0+500/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F4444x3333%20278%200%2Fresize%2F4444x3333%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fca%2Fc6%2F630abc504f998326aab74da426ba%2Fgettyimages-2155283902.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Williams Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts.\n\nREAD MORE: Canada's newest astronauts get their first missions to space\n\nThis mission is the very first crewed flight for Boeing's CST-100 Starliner.\n\nThe spacecraft on this flight, named Calypso, is one of two Starliners that Boeing has launched into space, and this is the third orbital mission so far for the company.\n\nThe two prior missions were uncrewed tests, with no astronauts on board.\n\nThe first uncrewed test, in December 2019, was flown by this very same spacecraft. Although Calypso successfully launched and orbited Earth, once in space it suffered a computer problem that caused it to use up more fuel than was intended. This prevented the spacecraft from docking with the ISS. However, upon its return to Earth, the mission was deemed a partial success.\n\nThe second, flown by the unnamed Boeing Starliner Spacecraft 2, lifted off in May of 2022, after a delay from its original August 2021 launch date. This mission was a complete success, rendezvousing and docking with the space station, and then returning to Earth after six days in space.\n\nBoeing's Starliner Spacecraft 2 approaches the ISS in this photograph taken during the May 2022 uncrewed test flight. (NASA)\n\nBoeing's first crewed test flight has been in the works for a long time. The original launch date was expected sometime in 2017. However, the program was plagued by technical issues, pushing each test later and later, with NASA even suggesting the second uncrewed test before they would clear Starliner to carry astronauts into space.\n\nEven this exact flight suffered several delays. The first attempt was on May 6, which was scrubbed due to a helium leak detected in the second stage of the United Launch Alliance booster rocket. Follow-up dates were set for May 17, May 21, and May 25, as Boeing and ULA attempted to fix the issue. Each time, the launch was pushed back.\n\nWith the flight finally lifting off without issue, Wilmore and Williams are expected to spend the next seven days in space -- one day to catch up to the space station and dock, five days in orbit on the station, and one day to return for landing.\n\nAfter this test, the first full operational flight of a Starliner mission is expected to take place in early 2025. On board that mission will be two NASA astronauts, Scott Tingle and Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Canadian astronaut Joshua Kutryk.\n\nCanadian astronaut Joshua Kutryk. (CSA)\n\nNASA's live coverage of the arrival and docking of Starliner Calypso is expected to start at 12:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, June 6.\n\nAccording to the space agency, the hatch between Starliner and the ISS will open, with Wilmore and Williams joining the Expedition 71 Crew on the station, at around 2 p.m. EDT.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is the first launch with astronauts of the Boeing CFT-100 spacecraft and United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. The flight test, which launched at 10:52 a.m. EDT, serves as an end-to-end demonstration of Boeing's crew transportation system and will carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to and from the orbiting laboratory.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are safely in orbit on the first crewed flight test aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft bound for the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, the astronauts lifted off at 10:52 a.m. EDT Wednesday on a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on an end-to-end test of the Starliner system.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday, June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nWilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\nNASA's arrival and in-flight event coverage is as follows (all times Eastern and subject to change based on real-time operations):\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\n3:30 p.m. - Post-docking news conference at NASA Johnson with the following participants:\n\nCoverage of the post-docking news conference will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\n5:50 p.m. - NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, Associate Administrator Jim Free, Associate Administrator for Space Operations Ken Bowersox, and Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche will speak with Wilmore and Williams about their launch aboard the Starliner spacecraft.\n\n8:50 a.m. - NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams will provide a tour of Starliner.\n\n11 a.m. - Williams will speak to students from Sunita L. Williams Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts, in an event aboard the space station.\n\n3:15 p.m. - Wilmore will speak to students from Tennessee Tech University in an event aboard the space station.\n\nWilmore is the commander for the mission. A veteran of two spaceflights, Wilmore has 178 days in space under his belt. In 2009, he served as a pilot aboard space shuttle Atlantis for the STS-129 mission. Additionally, Wilmore served as a flight engineer for Expedition 41 until November 2014, when he assumed command of the space station after arrival of the Expedition 42 crew. He returned to Earth the following March. Prior to his selection by NASA in 2000, the father of two obtained both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, before graduating with another master's degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, and has completed four operational deployments during his tenure as a fleet naval officer and aviator.\n\nWilliams is the spacecraft pilot for the flight test. Williams has spent 322 days in space across two missions: Expedition 14/15 in 2006 through 2007, and Expedition 32/33 in 2012. The Massachusetts native also conducted seven spacewalks, totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes. Before her career began with NASA in 1998, Williams graduated with her bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, before obtaining her master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. In total, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program has delivered on its goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station from the United States through a partnership with American private industry. This partnership is changing the arc of human spaceflight history by opening access to low Earth orbit and the space station to more people, science, and commercial opportunities. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in space exploration, including future missions to the Moon under Artemis and, eventually, Mars.\n\nLearn more about NASA's Commercial Crew program at:", "source": {"uri": "nasa.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanette_Epps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeanette Epps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barratt_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Barratt (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\n------", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The mission is the first crewed orbital test flight for Boeing following two previous demonstrations that were conducted with no astronauts on board.\n\nNASA, which provided live coverage of Saturday's launch, is expected to provide coverage of the landing as well.\n\nHere's what to know about the mission.\n\nLatest on Boeing Starliner after launching from Florida\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft was perched atop the Atlas V rocket when it launched at 10:52 a.m. ET Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nWhat's next for Starliner?\n\nIf all goes to plan, Starliner will dock Thursday morning on the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module. Once it reaches the space station in less than 24 hours, crew will spend a little more than a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth.\n\nThe craft will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nWho is on board the Starliner?\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the space station.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts on board the Starliner for Monday's launch are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both Navy test pilots who have ventured to space twice before.\n\nWhat happened on past Boeing test flights?\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe follow-up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple issues as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later on, Florida Today reported.\n\nBoeing competes with SpaceX to make low-Earth orbit trips\n\nA successful mission would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's\u202fcommercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion and SpaceX was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecrafts capable of making crewed scientific trips to low-Earth orbit, Florida Today reported.\n\nUnder NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nIn March, SpaceX had its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket needed to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo era.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything seemed to go smoothly before and during liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The capsule and its inaugural crew - NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams - will be bound for the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nLast-minute issues have pushed back Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nULA engineers replaced a power supply unit for that computer and put Starliner back on track for launch. The local weather is forecast to be 90% favorable for liftoff, according to U.S. Space Force launch weather analysts.\n\nThe crew is due to spend about a week at the space station before returning to Earth. Starliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe mission is Boeing's final test before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut flights that would make it the second U.S. ride to orbit.\n\nBoeing has faced years of Starliner development delays and more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns, as well as a series of crises involving the company's 737 MAX jetliners in its centerpiece aviation business.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nNASA has long sought two U.S. rides to the ISS in order to have a backup, in addition to the joint astronaut flights the agency conducts with Russia's Soyuz rocket.\n\nWilmore, 61, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot. Williams, 58, is a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.

(AP) -- Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out minutes before liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

A failed power distribution source at SLC-41 halted Saturday's launch attempt. As ground crews changed out and tested the system Sunday, Wilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, continued preparations for the mission as they remained quarantined at adjacent Kennedy Space Center.\n\n\"The ULA team identified an issue with a single ground power supply within one of the three redundant chassis that provides power to a subset of computer cards controlling various system functions, including the card responsible for the stable replenishment topping valves for the Centaur upper stage. All three of these chassis are required to enter the terminal phase of the launch countdown to ensure crew safety,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\n\"I really appreciate all the work by the NASA, Boeing and ULA teams over the last week,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. \"In particular, the ULA team worked really hard to quickly learn more about these issues, kept our NASA and Boeing teams informed and protected for this next attempt. We will continue to take it one step at a time.\"\n\nLast month, the mission to certify Starliner for future manned missions was scrubbed 2 hours before launch over concerns about an oxygen relief valve. The noise heard May 6 turned out to be a mechanical valve that vents gas, which \"every now and then will flutter or buzz,\" according to Tory Bruno, ULA's chief executive officer.\n\nOnce Starliner successfully launches, the capsule will break away from the Atlas V rocket within the first 24 hours and fire its own engines to travel to the space station.\n\nWilmore and Williams, who are U.S. Navy-trained test pilots and helped develop the Starliner capsule, will use the mission to make sure all systems on board work as planned so that the spacecraft can be certified for future manned missions.\n\nStarliner will take Wilmore and Williams to the forward-facing port of the space station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThe astronauts will remain at the space station for about a week to test the Starliner spacecraft in preparation for certification, which could put Boeing in direct competition with SpaceX and its commercial flight program.\n\nWilmore and Williams will return to Earth 10 days after launch in the same capsule, which is to parachute to a landing in the southwestern United States.", "source": {"uri": "spacedaily.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavor to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station.

Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. The only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

But Boeing will hope the launch will finally help it try and rival Elon Musk's SpaceX in offering Nasa the ability to get its astronauts up to orbit.\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew were headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), two years after the Starliner completed its first test voyage to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe single-engine Atlas V upper stage was expected to separate from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight and carry the Starliner farther into space, where it was due to separate from the upper stage about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at ISS after a flight of about 24 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out minutes before liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station.

It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year.

REUTERS/Joe Skipper\n\nBy Joey Roulette\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew were headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), two years after the Starliner completed its first test voyage to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe single-engine Atlas V upper stage was expected to separate from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight and carry the Starliner farther into space, where it was due to separate from the upper stage about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at ISS after a flight of about 24 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The mission is the first crewed orbital test flight for Boeing following two previous demonstrations that were conducted with no astronauts on board.\n\nNASA, which provided live coverage of Saturday's launch, is expected to provide coverage of the landing as well.\n\nHere's what to know about the mission.\n\nLatest on Boeing Starliner after launching from Florida\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft was perched atop the Atlas V rocket when it launched at 10:52 a.m. ET Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nWhat's next for Starliner?\n\nIf all goes to plan, Starliner will dock Thursday morning on the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module. Once it reaches the space station in less than 24 hours, crew will spend a little more than a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth.\n\nThe craft will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nWho is on board the Starliner?\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the space station.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts on board the Starliner for Monday's launch are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both Navy test pilots who have ventured to space twice before.\n\nWhat happened on past Boeing test flights?\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe follow-up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple issues as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later on, Florida Today reported.\n\nBoeing competes with SpaceX to make low-Earth orbit trips\n\nA successful mission would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion and SpaceX was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecrafts capable of making crewed scientific trips to low-Earth orbit, Florida Today reported.\n\nUnder NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nIn March, SpaceX had its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket needed to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo era. While in orbit, the Starship hit several key milestones and conducted a handful of in-flight tests that are a crucial step forward for it to be reliable and functional in time for Artemis III, slated for sometime in 2026.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched March 3 and docked March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to NASA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

You can watch the embedded video live at the top of the page or on USA TODAY's YouTube channel.\n\nLaunches are also streamed through NASA via NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, on YouTube or on the agency's website, with live coverage beginning at 6:45 a.m. ET.\n\nIf Wednesday's launch date does not go as planned, another possible launch date is Thursday, June 6.\n\nA year behind and over budget: Timeline shows Boeing Starliner struggles and scrubs\n\nThe Saturday launch was scrubbed about 4 minutes before liftoff. In a post on X, NASA said the launch attempt was stopped \"due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count.\"\n\nThis week's launch attempt follows several delays including a May 6 launch halted by a series of technical issues, an oxygen leak and a helium leak from the capsule's propulsion system.\n\nWhere is the Boeing Starliner going?\n\nThe Boeing Crew Flight Test is meant to carry two NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both former Navy pilots, to and from the International Space Station.\n\nOnce on board, Wilmore and Williams will stay at the ISS for about a week to test the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems.\n\nWhat is the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate a crew of no more than seven for missions to low-Earth orbit. On NASA missions, the capsule would carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the space station.\n\nIf Starliner is successful, NASA will begin the final process of certifying the spacecraft and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to the U.S. space agency.\n\nBoeing was awarded $4.8 billion from NASA in 2014 to develop Starliner, a private industry-built vehicle that can ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n\nCompetitor, SpaceX, which recently saw the return of its eighth crew sent to the ISS, was awarded $3.1 billion to develop its respective spacecraft, as part of NASA's commercial crew program. NASA has also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, USA TODAY\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Starliner launch today: Watch live as Boeing attempts liftoff to ISS", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_deletter@aol.com", "name": "Emily DeLetter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lander (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FrlomxCJV3pJq5aN3cVxoQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/1c279f330a0cfe94ff8ef40f06bd214d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 412, "textEnd": 418}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 846, "textEnd": 852}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1264, "textEnd": 1269}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Boeing and Centennial-based United Launch Alliance launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nThe flight marks a major milestone for ULA -- the rocket manufacturing company set up up by Boeing and Lockheed Martin out of the Denver metro area -- with its first human launch in its 18-year history.\n\nThis test flight critical is for Boeing's Starliner to get NASA's certification to start routine crewed flights to the ISS and begin competing with SpaceX's Dragon.\n\nThese flights might not only go to the ISS but also to future space stations operated by private companies once the ISS shuts down.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe 172-foot-tall Atlas V rocket is from the same model of rockets from the 1950s that sent the first American, John Glenn, into Earth's orbit. It was originally designed by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin before ULA took over its manufacturing. The liftoff Wednesday from Cape Canaveral was the 100th Atlas V rocket to go into space.\n\nULA adjusted the rocket -- which shifted toward launching satellites and spacecraft for decades -- for the astronauts' safety. It has an emergency detection system that can automatically trigger an abort mission if an issue is detected.\n\nIt also brought back the \"Dual Engine Centaur,\" a fuel reserve of liquid hydrogen and oxygen, that boosts the rocket's thrust to have better control of the flight's trajectory and make sure its path allows for safely bringing astronauts back to earth in case of an emergency.\n\nIt was a feature used on all Atlas rockets between 1962 and 2000 and was brought back for the Starliner, according to ULA.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

After delays due to technical issues, the CST-100 Starliner capsule, carrying two NASA astronauts, aims to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon. This mission is crucial for Boeing to secure certification for routine flights to the International Space Station.\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft is set for a third attempt to fly astronauts to space for the first time on Wednesday, a much-delayed testing milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped CST-100 Starliner capsule, with two astronauts aboard, is due for liftoff at 10:52 a.m. ET (1452 GMT) from a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket from Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA). Boeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. The capsule and its inaugural crew - NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams - will be bound for the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nLast-minute issues have pushed back Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer. ULA engineers replaced a power supply unit for that computer and put Starliner back on track for launch. The local weather is forecast to be 90% favorable for liftoff, according to U.S. Space Force launch weather analysts.\n\nThe crew is due to spend about a week at the space station before returning to Earth. Starliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard. The mission is Boeing's final test before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut flights that would make it the second U.S. ride to orbit.\n\nBoeing has faced years of Starliner development delays and more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns, as well as a series of crises involving the company's 737 MAX jetliners in its centerpiece aviation business. The longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program. NASA has long sought two U.S. rides to the ISS in order to have a backup, in addition to the joint astronaut flights the agency conducts with Russia's Soyuz rocket.\n\nWilmore, 61, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot. Williams, 58, is a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. They have spent a combined 500 days in space during two ISS missions each. If the launch is postponed on Wednesday, Boeing could try again on Thursday. Any delay beyond Thursday could last weeks because of perishable items that would need to be replaced on Starliner and the rocket after sitting on the ground for a month. Other missions scheduled in Cape Canaveral and on the ISS could add to the delays.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/05_06_2024_10_02_33_3404755.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1297, "textEnd": 1302}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is the first launch with astronauts of the Boeing CFT-100 spacecraft and United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. The flight test, which launched at 10:52 a.m. EDT, serves as an end-to-end demonstration of Boeing's crew transportation system and will carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to and from the orbiting laboratory.\n\nCredits: NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are safely in orbit on the first crewed flight test aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft bound for the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, the astronauts lifted off at 10:52 a.m. EDT Wednesday on a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on an end-to-end test of the Starliner system.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday, June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nWilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\nNASA's arrival and in-flight event coverage is as follows (all times Eastern and subject to change based on real-time operations):\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\nThursday, June 6\n\n12:15 p.m. - Targeted docking\n\n2 p.m. - Hatch opening\n\n2:20 p.m. - Welcome remarks\n\n3:30 p.m. - Post-docking news conference at NASA Johnson with the following participants:\n\n* NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free\n\n* Steve Stich, manager, NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\n* Jeff Arend, manager for systems engineering and integration, NASA's International Space Station Office\n\n* Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager, Commercial Crew Program, Boeing\n\n5:50 p.m. - NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, Associate Administrator Jim Free, Associate Administrator for Space Operations Ken Bowersox, and Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche will speak with Wilmore and Williams about their launch aboard the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nSaturday, June 8\n\n8:50 a.m. - NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams will provide a tour of Starliner.\n\nMonday, June 10\n\n11 a.m. - Williams will speak to students from Sunita L. Williams Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts, in an event aboard the space station.\n\nTuesday, June 11\n\n3:15 p.m. - Wilmore will speak to students from Tennessee Tech University in an event aboard the space station.\n\nMeet NASA's Crew\n\nWilmore is the commander for the mission. A veteran of two spaceflights, Wilmore has 178 days in space under his belt. In 2009, he served as a pilot aboard space shuttle Atlantis for the STS-129 mission. Additionally, Wilmore served as a flight engineer for Expedition 41 until November 2014, when he assumed command of the space station after arrival of the Expedition 42 crew. He returned to Earth the following March. Prior to his selection by NASA in 2000, the father of two obtained both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, before graduating with another master's degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, and has completed four operational deployments during his tenure as a fleet naval officer and aviator.\n\nWilliams is the spacecraft pilot for the flight test. Williams has spent 322 days in space across two missions: Expedition 14/15 in 2006 through 2007, and Expedition 32/33 in 2012. The Massachusetts native also conducted seven spacewalks, totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes. Before her career began with NASA in 1998, Williams graduated with her bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, before obtaining her master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. In total, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program has delivered on its goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station from the United States through a partnership with American private industry. This partnership is changing the arc of human spaceflight history by opening access to low Earth orbit and the space station to more people, science, and commercial opportunities. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in space exploration, including future missions to the Moon under Artemis and, eventually, Mars.\n\nLearn more about NASA's

of crises involving its 737 MAX planes, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion (\u20ac1.38bn) over budget.\n\nTwo two years ago, it completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon.\n\nBut Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner programme.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA.\n\nThat capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the US space agency's Artemis programme.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the ISS on Thursday and dock with the orbiting research outpost 400km above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary.\n\nThe test flight calls for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams to practice manoeuvring the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nMr Wilmore and Ms Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US desert - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2bn (\u20ac3.9bn) fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different US rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff from Texas on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out minutes before liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nBy MARCIA DUNN, The Associated Press\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP) -- After years of stumbles and delays, Boeing has finally launched astronauts to the International Space...\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- After years of stumbles and delays, Boeing has finally launched astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA.\n\nIt's the first flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station.\n\nNASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of empty test flights.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nTHE CAPSULE\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner planes.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed. Wednesday's launch was the third try with astronauts; two earlier countdowns were scuttled by rocket-related issues.\n\nTHE CREW\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts.\n\nTHE TEST FLIGHT\n\nStarliner blasted off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's the first time astronauts have ridden an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Now 62 years later, Wednesday's launch was the 100th for the top-of-the-line Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station with its seven residents on Thursday. Starliner will remain docked for just over a week, undergoing checkouts before landing in the American West.\n\nSTARLINER VS. DRAGON\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX's capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Plans called for Wilmore and Williams to briefly take manual control to test out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was delivering supplies to the space station, and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing has a more traditional \"astrovan.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks, but these rides are separate from NASA's dedicated six-month missions.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will attempt to deliver cargo to the station later this year, before accepting passengers. It is due to launch on ULA's new Vulcan rocket, the eventual successor to the Atlas V.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP) -- Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out minutes before liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nRelated Story: June's Planetary Parade: What You Can and Can't See\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavor to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nRelated Story: Astronomers Find the Biggest Known Batch of Planet Ingredients Swirling Around ...\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nRelated Story: Strong Solar Storm Could Disrupt Communications and Produce Northern Lights in ...\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. The only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"", "source":

Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of empty test flights.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nTHE CAPSULE\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner planes.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed. Wednesday's launch was the third try with astronauts; two earlier countdowns were scuttled by rocket-related issues.\n\nTHE CREW\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts.\n\nTHE TEST FLIGHT\n\nStarliner blasted off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's the first time astronauts have ridden an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Now 62 years later, Wednesday's launch was the 100th for the top-of-the-line Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station with its seven residents on Thursday. Starliner will remain docked for just over a week, undergoing checkouts before landing in the American West.\n\nSTARLINER VS. DRAGON\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX's capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Plans called for Wilmore and Williams to briefly take manual control to test out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was delivering supplies to the space station, and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing has a more traditional \"astrovan.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks, but these rides are separate from NASA's dedicated six-month missions.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will attempt to deliver cargo to the station later this year, before accepting passengers. It is due to launch on ULA's new Vulcan rocket, the eventual successor to the Atlas V.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The capsule and its inaugural crew - NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams - will be bound for the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nLast-minute issues have pushed back Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nULA engineers replaced a power supply unit for that computer and put Starliner back on track for launch. The local weather is forecast to be 90% favorable for liftoff, according to U.S. Space Force launch weather analysts.\n\nThe crew is due to spend about a week at the space station before returning to Earth. Starliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe mission is Boeing's final test before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut flights that would make it the second U.S. ride to orbit.\n\nBoeing has faced years of Starliner development delays and more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns, as well as a series of crises involving the company's 737 MAX jetliners in its centerpiece aviation business.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nNASA has long sought two U.S. rides to the ISS in order to have a backup, in addition to the joint astronaut flights the agency conducts with Russia's Soyuz rocket.\n\nWilmore, 61, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot. Williams, 58, is a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. They have spent a combined 500 days in space during two ISS missions each.\n\nIf the launch is postponed on Wednesday, Boeing could try again on Thursday. Any delay beyond Thursday could last weeks because of perishable items that would need to be replaced on Starliner and the rocket after sitting on the ground for a month. Other missions scheduled in Cape Canaveral and on the ISS could add to the delays.\n\nReporting by Joey Roulette; Editing by Will Dunham", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_roulette@reuters.com", "name": "Joey Roulette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2KXB2RYSCNOGFJ7B2GU2SMVAKM.jpg?auth=b45544ed89ed7e1dc47bacc928f53ca211502bad7723ad81cf3e37053f505c5e&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 18}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1045, "textEnd": 1050}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

After years of delays, the spacecraft is set to rendezvous with the ISS. The mission is crucial for Boeing and NASA's goal of having two reliable space transport systems.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew were headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), two years after the Starliner completed its first test voyage to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth. Boeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer. On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe Atlas V upper stage separated from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own in space, Starliner will ascend deeper into space and fire its onboard thrusters to plug itself into orbit and kick off its 24-hour catch-up with the ISS. The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth. BOEING AMBITIONS\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Starliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program. Meanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. If all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the ISS on Thursday and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth. Wilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030. Meanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Docking and berthing of spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/05_06_2024_15_02_21_0252364.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1412, "textEnd": 1417}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- After years of stumbles and delays, Boeing has finally launched astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA.\n\nIt's the first flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule with a crew on board, a pair of NASA pilots who will check out the spacecraft during the test drive and a weeklong stay at the space station.\n\nNASA turned to U.S. companies for astronaut rides after the space shuttles were retired. Elon Musk's SpaceX has made nine taxi trips for NASA since 2020, while Boeing has managed only a pair of empty test flights.\n\nProvided this tryout goes well, NASA will alternate between Boeing and SpaceX to get astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nA look at the newest ride and its shakedown cruise:\n\nTHE CAPSULE\n\nWhite with black and blue trim, Boeing's Starliner capsule is about 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) in diameter. It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner planes.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed. Wednesday's launch was the third try with astronauts; two earlier countdowns were scuttled by rocket-related issues.\n\nTHE CREW\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up. Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts.\n\nTHE TEST FLIGHT\n\nStarliner blasted off on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's the first time astronauts have ridden an Atlas since NASA's Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Now 62 years later, Wednesday's launch was the 100th for the top-of-the-line Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nStarliner should reach the space station with its seven residents on Thursday. Starliner will remain docked for just over a week, undergoing checkouts before landing in the American West.\n\nSTARLINER VS. DRAGON\n\nBoth Boeing and SpaceX's capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA's Orion capsules for moon missions. Plans called for Wilmore and Williams to briefly take manual control to test out the systems on their way to the space station.\n\nNASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was delivering supplies to the space station, and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing has a more traditional \"astrovan.\"\n\nOne big difference at flight's end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nBoeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station's planned end in 2030. Boeing has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients. SpaceX periodically sells seats to tycoons and even countries eager to get their citizens to the station for a couple weeks, but these rides are separate from NASA's dedicated six-month missions.\n\nComing soon: Sierra Space's mini shuttle, Dream Chaser, which will attempt to deliver cargo to the station later this year, before accepting passengers. It is due to launch on ULA's new Vulcan rocket, the eventual successor to the Atlas V.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Starliner's first crewed test flight blasted off at 10:52 a.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. It is the sixth time in history NASA astronauts had launched on a new spacecraft.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket hoisted the capsule into the sky, blowing out enormous plumes behind it. NASA confirmed the ship, named Calypso by Williams, reached space minutes later.\n\n\"Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you,\" Wilmore said right before liftoff. \"Let's put some fire in this rocket, let's push it to the heavens where all these tough Americans are prepared to be.\"\n\nIf the flight goes as planned, Wilmore and Williams will reach the International Space Station on Thursday and remain at the lab, about 250 miles above the planet, for about a week. Williams is the first woman to pilot a new orbital spacecraft.\n\nFor the ride home, rather than plop the astronauts into the ocean as SpaceX does, Boeing will bring the astronauts home to the Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. A system of parachutes and air bags should cushion the capsule's desert landing.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to build spaceships to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station in 2014. While SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule went into service four years ago and has since ferried at least 50 people into orbit, Boeing's Starliner has yet to pass muster. The legacy company has struggled to resolve a series of issues with the spacecraft.\n\nBut problems with the rocket -- not Starliner -- caused the past two scrubbed launches. On Saturday, a ground computer that takes over when the rocket is in the final minutes of the countdown executed the abort. Teams have since swapped out a faulty power distribution unit that caused the automated launch cancellation. Mission managers inspected the replacement and approved the rocket for another liftoff attempt this week.\n\nA successful flight of Starliner would help to secure a second commercial carrier for taking astronauts into space. No longer serviced by its own Space Shuttle, NASA hitched rides on Russian rockets after 2011 to the space station. Though SpaceX has provided a taxi service for NASA since 2020, the agency never intended to have all its eggs in Elon Musk's basket and says it's still crucial to have a backup.\n\nIf certified, Starliner missions will have the ability to take up to four astronauts to the station at a time, increasing the amount of research at the orbiting lab.\n\n\"Right now we only have two ways to get humans into space. One was with the Soyuz and our Russian partners, and we all know that our relationship with the Russian Federation is a little bit tricky,\" said Mike Fincke, an alternate NASA astronaut for the Starliner crew. \"This redundant way to go is so that if something goes wrong with anybody, we still can get people up and down to the International Space Station.\"\n\nStarliner is carrying close to 800 pounds of cargo, which includes food, clothing, exercise gear, medical supplies, photo and media equipment, tools, and other items, including a thumb drive of 3,500 images of children's artwork.",

A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny.\n\nAnother try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapour as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe single-engine Atlas V upper stage was expected to separate from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight and carry the Starliner farther into space, where it was due to separate from the upper stage about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner programme.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the US space agency's Artemis program.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at ISS after a flight of about 24 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different US rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.", "source": {"uri": "arnnewscentre.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARN News Centre"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Docking and berthing of spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://mmo.aiircdn.com/265/66607ecdbb50f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1092, "textEnd": 1097}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

It was the 100th Atlas V launch, but the first with people at the pointy end of a version of that rocket modified for human spaceflight.\n\nThe vehicle's two RD-180 liquid-fueled engines ignited seconds before T-0, followed by two small solid-fueled rocket boosters that combined to send the rocket sprinting into a mostly clear sky. Starliner proceeded smoothly through SRB burnout and jettison, first-stage cutoff, separation, and then a burn of the Atlas V's Centaur second stage to take it to the verge of orbit.\n\nFifteen minutes after Starliner left Earth, the spacecraft was flying free in space -- which, as NASA's commentators noted, allowed the astronauts to put aside printed checklists and break out tablet computers.\n\nWilmore radioed down a message to ULA, formed in 2006 as a joint venture between the space divisions of Lockheed Martin and Boeing: \"They've been a member of the family for a long time, but now it's official, and we want to welcome them to human spaceflight.\"\n\nA brief burn of Starliner's own engines 30 minutes after launch took it the rest of the way to orbit. The capsule that Williams christened Calypso now heads to the International Space Station for a scheduled docking at 12:15 Eastern on Thursday. Its cargo includes a urine processor to extract potable water to replace a broken ISS unit.\n\nThe mission schedule calls for the two astronauts to spend eight days on the ISS, then return to Earth to land under parachutes and cushioned by airbags on one of a few designated desert landing sites in the western United States.\n\nThis successful debut of the spacecraft Boeing designed and built under a fixed-price contract for NASA gives the beleaguered Arlington, Va., aerospace company a break from a series of self-inflicted wounds, including an improperly installed door plug getting blown out of an Alaska Airlines-operated 737 Max 9.\n\nIt also makes the United States the first country that can choose which model of spacecraft its astronauts fly to orbit from its soil -- in addition to the Russian Soyuz capsules that continue to carry astronauts and cosmonauts to the ISS and back.\n\nWednesday's launch followed two scrubs. Flight controllers called off a May 6 attempt because of an issue with a liquid-oxygen valve on the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage, then delayed it further to troubleshoot small helium leaks in Starliner's maneuvering engines. Then a glitch with one of the computers sequencing a June 1 launch attempt scrubbed it with only three minutes and 50 seconds left in the countdown.\n\nUnder NASA's original vision, Starliner might have flown seven years ago. After the agency resisted Congressional pressure to hand a single crew-transportation contract to Boeing and instead picked both Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft -- a $4.2 billion award to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX -- NASA projected a first flight in 2017.\n\nThe smaller sum awarded to SpaceX has been money vastly better spent, with SpaceX's Crew Dragon returning astronaut launches to American soil after an almost nine-year gap with its May 30, 2020, crewed mission to the ISS. Meanwhile, Boeing's costs have rocketed past that fixed-price award, with the company reporting last June that its losses had hit almost $1.5 billion.\n\nStarliner's first uncrewed launch in 2019 suffered a series of serious software problems that left it unable to dock with the ISS and could have resulted in the loss of the vehicle itself. Its second flight test, delayed after extensive work to fix valve problems, didn't happen until May 2022, after which Boeing had to replace part of the capsule's electrical wiring and tweak its parachute design.\n\nFor NASA, having Starliner as a Plan B -- even though Dragon's reliability and the reusability of booster stages on SpaceX's Falcon 9 have vindicated NASA's faith in outsourcing orbital spacecraft to private industry -- goes back to the agency's emphasis on redundancy.\n\n\"You always want to have a backup position,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a taped interview during the June 1 broadcast.\n\nStarliner can accommodate up to seven astronauts, but NASA plans to fly four to the ISS on the six operational missions it has booked after this test launch.\n\nBoeing's commercialization plans for its capsule aren't as far along as SpaceX's, which have now featured Axiom's private flights of Dragon to the ISS. But Boeing does intend to have Starliner fly to the Orbital Reef commercial space station it's developing with Sierra Space and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, supported by $172 million in funding from NASA.\n\nNASA has been sending astronauts to orbit for more than 60 years, but Starliner's liftoff was only the sixth time astronauts have flown a new vehicle to orbit from American soil, following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the Space Shuttle, and Dragon.\n\nThe expendable launch vehicle underneath Starliner itself encapsulates much of that history as well as that of the Cold War and its aftermath.\n\nThe Atlas V, a workhorse for civilian and military satellite launches since 2002, takes its name from a series of rockets that go back all of those 60-plus years. NASA's first Atlas rockets, based on a line of US Air Force ICBMs, took Mercury astronauts to orbit starting with John Glenn's launch in 1962 and represent \"Atlas V's great-grandaddy,\" as ULA CEO Tory Bruno said during NASA's June 1 coverage.\n\nDecades later, the Atlas V lifts off with RD-180 engines built in Russia -- which at the time of that rocket's design outperformed anything comparable in the States and kept ex-Soviet rocket engineers gainfully employed. But that supply chain became a liability after Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea and led ULA to develop its Vulcan rocket around Blue Origin's BE-4 engines. Vulcan flew for the first time in January.\n\nWhile some of the remaining Atlas V launches will launch Project Kuiper satellites for Amazon's low-Earth-orbit broadband service, this rocket is now set to end its career in the same way the original Atlas came to fame: sending Americans to space.", "source": {"uri": "me.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Mag Middle East"}, "authors":

The two remain quarantined at Kennedy Space Center ahead of liftoff.\n\nThe former Navy test pilots will be the first to launch aboard Starliner to the space station as part of the U.S space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_Weather_Squadron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "45th Weather Squadron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/june/nasa-jun05-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "dateEnd": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 714, "textEnd": 730}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 516}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 821, "textEnd": 827}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

(Image credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky)\n\nNASA, Boeing and United Launch Alliance (ULA) celebrated the historic launch of a second commercial crew spacecraft with astronauts today (June 5).\n\nBoeing's Starliner headed toward the International Space Station (ISS) today at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 GMT) with two NASA astronauts and former U.S. Navy test pilots on board: Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. The duo made the record books not only as the first humans to ride Starliner, but also the first to launch atop ULA's veteran Atlas V rocket.\n\n\"This is a special moment. It's another one of those great markers in history,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a post-launch press conference today at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, near the launch site, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\n\"What NASA does is hard,\" Nelson added. \"Spaceflight is hard, but it's worth doing.\"\n\nRelated: I flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators. Here's what I learned (video, photos)\n\nToday's launch marked the first time astronauts have left Earth from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (or its many previous incarnations, which included Cape Kennedy Air Force Station and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station) since Apollo 7 in 1968. But more will likely follow in its footsteps soon.\n\nThe agency's other commercial crew vendor, SpaceX, has already sent astronauts to space multiple times, first notching this milestone four years ago. SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which built off the company's successful cargo Dragon design, carried its first astronauts to space on a test flight in May 2020. Boeing, working with a new spacecraft, needed extra time to achieve the same thing.\n\nStarliner's first uncrewed test flight, in December 2019, suffered several software glitches that kept the spacecraft in the wrong orbit, unable to reach the ISS. The second uncrewed effort, which launched in May 2022, was successful: Starliner arrived at the ISS safely. Yet the newly launched astronaut mission, known as Crew Flight Test (CFT), faced new delays in 2023 after significant issues were found with Starliner's parachute system and wiring (much of which was wrapped in flammable tape); these necessitated fixes, which took time.\n\nSeveral other, more minor issues cropped up right before launch. CFT was supposed to get off the ground on May 6, but the team called that try off about two hours before launch after noticing a misbehaving valve in the Atlas V's upper stage. ULA decided to replace the valve, which pushed the next try back to May 17. But then teams noticed a slight helium leak in one of Starliner's reaction-control thrusters, which delayed things further. Ultimately, NASA, Boeing and ULA deemed the helium leak a minor issue and cleared CFT for launch on June 1. That try, however, was aborted just minutes before liftoff thanks to faulty ground equipment, pushing liftoff back to today.\n\n\"I know it's really easy to lose patience as you're waiting for launches to happen,\" Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, said during today's press conference. \"But, as I said before, good things are worth waiting for.\"\n\nThe focus of the CFT team is now on making sure Wilmore and Williams safely reach the ISS while testing key systems along the way. The duo will do some manual flying, for example, to get a feel for Starliner's various systems.\n\nWilmore and Williams are \"going to test this thing from izzard to gizzard, and they're going to certify it for a rotational basis to send crew to the International Space Station,\" Nelson said. (\"Izzard,\" in case you were wondering, is another word for the letter \"z.\")\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Starliner will dock autonomously with the orbiting facility tomorrow (June 6) around 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT), a milestone that you can watch live here at Space.com.\n\nAssuming the roughly 10-day-long CFT goes as planned and the mission meets all major objectives, Boeing's first operational mission, Starliner-1, is scheduled for no earlier than 2025. That coming mission's commander, NASA astronaut Mike Fincke, was backup on CFT, while mission specialist and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Josh Kutryk worked ascent as capcom (capsule communicator). Also on board Starliner-1 will be NASA's Scott Tingle.\n\nKeeping the Starliner-1 crew tightly integrated with CFT was a key goal in training, to smooth the flow between the missions as much as possible, Boeing and NASA have emphasized, as the ISS seeks to welcome U.S.-led crews every six months. The goal is for Dragon and Starliner to alternate launch opportunities.\n\nRussia likely will not fly a cosmonaut aboard Starliner-1, as the country is waiting for more data on the spacecraft, NASA officials said in a press conference on May 3. How that will affect integrated crews in the future remains to be seen, as NASA plans to continue flying its astronauts aboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft for backup and policy reasons.\n\nBoeing is expected to fly six or seven operational Starliner crews until the planned retirement of ISS in 2030, although it is possible Starliner will continue to serve the agency, helping NASA astronauts get to and from commercial space stations planned in the next decade.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_howell@space.com", "name": "Elizabeth Howell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_7", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Bowersox", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ken Bowersox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

(AP) - Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams - retired Navy captains and former space station residents - stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries - Russia, the U.S. and China - had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nPictured at top: NASA astronauts Suni Williams, left, and Butch Wilmore pose for a photo after leaving the operations and checkout building for a trip to launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 on June 5, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla.

Chance of precipitation is 30%, with thunderstorms possible after noon.\n\nCrews scrubbed the first two Starliner launch attempts on May 6 and Saturday. The latter occurred with only 3 minutes and 50 seconds remaining in the countdown. The culprit: a computer ground launch sequencer.\n\nFor updates on the Starliner mission, visit floridatoday.com/space for FLORIDA TODAY Space Team live coverage starting about 6:30 a.m. The NASA TV broadcast will be posted on our blog starting about 6:45 a.m.\n\nRick Neale is a Space Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

FLORIDA TODAY's Space Team, which consists of award-winning reporter Rick Neale, reporter Brooke Edwards and veteran visuals journalist Craig Bailey, has its own coverage plans complete with a live blog, tweets, video and photos from Cape Canaveral, near Kennedy Space Center and across Brevard County.\n\nWho's the Starliner crew? On board the rocket will be two NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both Navy test pilots. They have each flown in space twice.\n\nEarlier launch attempts took place May 6 and June 1. Dubbed NASA's Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test Launch for livestreams online (see below for previous recordings).\n\nBelow is information on the long-anticipated Starliner rocket launch and how to watch FLORIDA TODAY Space Team's coverage on various platforms, from your Android or iPhone to your big screen in your living room.\n\nWhere to see liftoff (in person): If you're on the Space Coast, where to watch NASA Starliner launch send astronauts to space station\n\nWhat is Boeing's Starliner?\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft will transport NASA astronauts. The company calls it the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner, or simply \"Starliner.\" Set to launch no earlier than Saturday, June 1, 2024, it will make history as the first spacecraft to ferry humans from Space Launch Complex 41 in Cape Canaveral. The launch pad has been the site for historic missions beginning with the Titan rockets in 1965 and including the New Horizons deep space probe, the Voyager spacecraft, and even the Curiosity Mars rover.\n\nStarliner will be launched with the help of a United Launch Alliance (a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V rocket has launched from the site since 2002, but this will be the first time it carries astronauts to space.\n\nWho are the NASA astronauts flying into space for Starliner launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida?\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying this commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots. They have each flown in space twice and both bring a wide variety of experiences to the flight.\n\nWilliams was originally a helicopter test pilot before switching to flying jets. She's preparing to fly to space for the third time, as the crew test flight pilot.\n\nThis will be Wilmore's third spaceflight as well. Before becoming a NASA astronaut, Wilmore was a U.S. Navy captain, fighter pilot, and test pilot, accumulating more than 8,000 hours of flight time. Wilmore flew the FA-18 Hornet and T-45 Goshawk, playing a role in missions during Operation Desert Storm, Desert Shield and Southern Watch.\n\nIs there a rocket launch in Florida?

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year.

A faulty valve on the Atlas V rocket prevented liftoff May 6, then engineers discovered a helium leak on the Starliner capsule itself. After several weeks of troubleshooting, NASA and Boeing officials decided to proceed with another launch attempt Saturday.\n\nEverything seemed to be coming together for Boeing's long-delayed crew test flight until a computer problem triggered an automatic hold in the countdown less than four minutes before liftoff. Technicians from United Launch Alliance (ULA), the Atlas V rocket's builder and operator, traced the problem to a failed power distribution source connected to a ground computer responsible for controlling the final phase of the countdown.\n\nThe instantaneous launch opportunity Wednesday is set for 10:52 am EDT (14:52 UTC), when the launch site at Cape Canaveral passes underneath the space station's orbital plane. Forecasters predict a 90 percent chance of good weather for launch. You can watch NASA's live coverage in the video embedded below.\n\nThe countdown began late Tuesday night with the power-up of the Atlas V rocket, which was set to be filled with cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants around 5:00 am EDT (09:00 UTC). Kerosene fuel was loaded into the Atlas V's first-stage booster prior to the mission's first launch attempt in early May.\n\nThe two Starliner astronauts departed crew quarters at NASA's Kennedy Space Center for the 20-minute drive to the launch pad, where they arrived shortly before 8:00 am EDT (12:00 UTC) to climb into their seats inside the Starliner capsule. After pressure checks of the astronauts' suits and Starliner's crew cabin, ground teams will evacuate the pad about an hour before launch.\n\nAssuming all systems are \"go\" for launch, the Atlas V will ignite its Russian-made RD-180 main engine and two solid-fueled boosters to vault away from Cape Canaveral and head northeast over the Atlantic Ocean. Wilmore and Williams will be not only the first people to fly in space on Boeing's Starliner, but also the first astronauts to ride on an Atlas V rocket, which has flown 99 times before with satellites for the US military, NASA, and commercial customers.\n\nThe rocket's Centaur upper stage will deploy Starliner into space around 15 minutes after liftoff. A critical burn by Starliner's engines will happen around 31 minutes into the flight to finish the task of placing it into low-Earth orbit, setting it up for an automated docking at the International Space Station at 12:15 pm EDT (16:15 UTC) Thursday.\n\nThe two-person crew will stay on the station at least a week, although a mission extension is likely if the mission is going well. Officials may decide to extend the mission to complete more tests or to wait for optimal weather conditions at Starliner's primary and backup landing sites in New Mexico and Arizona. When weather conditions look favorable, Starliner will undock from the space station and head for landing under parachutes.\n\nThe crew test flight is a prerequisite to Boeing's crew capsule becoming operational for NASA, which awarded multibillion-dollar commercial crew contracts to Boeing and SpaceX in 2014. SpaceX's Crew Dragon started flying astronauts in 2020, while Boeing's project has been stricken by years of delays.\n\nWilmore and Williams, both former US Navy test pilots, will take over manual control of Starliner at several points during the test flight. They will evaluate the spacecraft's flying characteristics and accommodations for future flights, which will carry four astronauts at a time rather than two.\n\n\"The expectation from the media should not be perfection,\" Wilmore told Ars earlier this year. \"This is a test flight. Flying and operating in space is hard. It's really hard, and we're going to find some stuff. That's expected. It's the first flight where we are integrating the full capabilities of this spacecraft.\"", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_clark@arstechnica.com", "name": "Stephen Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coordinated Universal Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_suit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pressure suit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-180", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RD-180"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerosene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerosene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryogenics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/53704708015_ace34748fa_k-760x380.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 831, "textEnd": 836}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Their ride to space is an Atlas V rocket, built and operated by the United Launch Alliance, which will help put them en route to visit the International Space Station.\n\nThis mission is a key flight test for NASA to prove that Starliner can safely transport the agency's astronauts to and from the ISS. Boeing and rival SpaceX were both awarded NASA contracts in 2014 to build spacecraft that can ferry astronauts to the space station and back, part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nBut a series of technical glitches and setbacks have delayed Starliner's first crewed flight by roughly seven years and fueled some $1.5 billion in cost overruns. In the meantime, SpaceX has launched nine crews to the International Space Station for NASA since 2020.\n\nBoeing has also encountered last-minute issues that have stalled this critical test from getting off the ground.\n\nBoeing and NASA first tried to launch on May 6, but the flight was halted hours before takeoff due to an oddly behaving pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket.

The capsule and its inaugural crew - NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams - will be bound for the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nLast-minute issues have pushed back Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nULA engineers replaced a power supply unit for that computer and put Starliner back on track for launch. The local weather is forecast to be 90% favorable for liftoff, according to U.S. Space Force launch weather analysts.\n\nThe crew is due to spend about a week at the space station before returning to Earth. Starliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe mission is Boeing's final test before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut flights that would make it the second U.S. ride to orbit.\n\nBoeing has faced years of Starliner development delays and more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns, as well as a series of crises involving the company's 737 MAX jetliners in its centerpiece aviation business.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nNASA has long sought two U.S. rides to the ISS in order to have a backup, in addition to the joint astronaut flights the agency conducts with Russia's Soyuz rocket.\n\nWilmore, 61, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot. Williams, 58, is a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. They have spent a combined 500 days in space during two ISS missions each.\n\nIf the launch is postponed on Wednesday, Boeing could try again on Thursday. Any delay beyond Thursday could last weeks because of perishable items that would need to be replaced on Starliner and the rocket after sitting on the ground for a month. Other missions scheduled in Cape Canaveral and on the ISS could add to the delays.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

But Boeing will hope the launch will finally help it try and rival Elon Musk's SpaceX in offering Nasa the ability to get its astronauts up to orbit.\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew were headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), two years after the Starliner completed its first test voyage to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe single-engine Atlas V upper stage was expected to separate from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight and carry the Starliner farther into space, where it was due to separate from the upper stage about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon.

The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its

Credit: NASA\n\nAfter years of delays and multiple recent setbacks, Boeing's Starliner launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on June 5 aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket at 10:52AM. The spacecraft is now en route to deliver two astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch makes Boeing the second private contractor (after SpaceX) to transport humans for NASA, but the company's achievement is shadowed by ongoing airline manufacturing scandals.\n\nAt roughly 16.5-feet-tall and 15-feet-wide while attached to its rear service module, Starliner can accommodate as many as seven astronauts. For future NASA transport missions, however, Boeing generally expects four-member crews alongside payloads for each of Starliner's 10 planned missions. Today's launch included NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\n[Related: NASA and Boeing's Starliner delays expose the challenges of space travel.]\n\nJune 5's launch arrived after a decade of mounting development issues. NASA announced its first Commercial Crew Program contracts to Boeing and SpaceX for the development of new spacecraft in 2014. But despite receiving barely half of Boeing's $5.2 billion contract, SpaceX managed to launch the first-ever private transport of NASA astronauts in 2020. Boeing, meanwhile, wouldn't complete an uncrewed test flight until 2022.\n\nStarliner's ultimate fate was uncertain in summer 2023, when experts estimated the beleaguered project to have already cost Boeing $1.5 billion. In recent months, the company also drew public criticism and regulatory scrutiny after alleged engineering and safety issues led to high-profile emergencies aboard multiple Boeing 737 Max airplanes. Mission control delayed the spacecraft's launch multiple times already over the four weeks. On May 6, engineers discovered a malfunctioning valve in the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage that required replacement, while a small helium leak in one of Starlink's service module reaction-control thrusters was later detected on May 17. Mission control ultimately determined the gas leak did not pose a threat to the launch and moved the launch date to June 1. With less than 4-minutes to liftoff on Saturday, however, Starliner's launch was yet again scrubbed after engineers detected a computer issue within the ground launch sequence equipment.\n\nDespite these issues, Boeing's Starliner now appears back on track for commercial space ventures. During its trip to the ISS, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will test the vehicle's life-support and navigation systems, evaluate seats, and assess the system designed to move cargo into the space station. Starliner will then spend roughly 10 days docked with the ISS before departing back for Earth with its crew. Instead of a water landing, however, the spacecraft is designed to deploy parachutes and airbags for a soft touchdown at a land location in the southwest US.\n\nIts next launch is tentatively

The milestone launch means that NASA now has two commercial options for getting astronauts to space: Boeing and SpaceX.\n\nStarliner launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop an Atlas V rocket on 5 June at 10.52am local time following years of delay. Originally, a crewed launch was slated to occur by the end of 2017 but the programme ran slower than expected. This mission was finally scheduled to take off in May but a faulty valve forced NASA to abort the mission. A second launch attempt on 1 June was scrapped because of computer problems.\n\nBut the third launch just days later appeared to be a success, with the capsule reaching orbit according to plan. Aboard were NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will journey to the International Space Station over the course of 24 hours and stay for around a week while testing various systems, before returning to Earth in the same craft.\n\nThis particular capsule was named Calypso, reportedly after Jacques Cousteau's oceanography vessel. The goal of the mission is to verify Starliner is safe for crew transport to and from the ISS. If those tests are also a success, and the two astronauts safely return to Earth in Starliner, then similar craft can begin annual crewed flights to the space station.\n\nEach Starliner is designed to last for up to ten return flights, and can carry up to seven humans per flight. Standard operational flights are likely to carry only three or four astronauts, however.\n\nNASA awarded two contracts for shuttle craft to transport crew to the International Space Station a decade ago: one to Boeing for its Starliner and one to SpaceX for its Dragon capsule. Dragon pulled ahead of Starliner by making its first crewed flight in 2020.\n\nNow Starliner is the sixth spacecraft in US history to make a crewed launch, being preceded by Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the Space Shuttle and Dragon.", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (planet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oceanography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05163214/SEI_207481554.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 316, "textEnd": 322}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 616, "textEnd": 622}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe Atlas V upper stage separated from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own in space, Starliner will ascend deeper into space and fire its onboard thrusters to plug itself into orbit and kick off its 24-hour catch-up with the ISS.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBOEING AMBITIONS\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the ISS on Thursday and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette;

NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is the first launch with astronauts of the Boeing CFT-100 spacecraft and United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. The flight test, which launched at 10:52 a.m. EDT, serves as an end-to-end demonstration of Boeing's crew transportation system and will carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to and from the orbiting laboratory.Credits: NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are safely in orbit on the first crewed flight test aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft bound for the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, the astronauts lifted off at 10:52 a.m. EDT Wednesday on a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on an end-to-end test of the Starliner system.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday, June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nWilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\nNASA's arrival and in-flight event coverage is as follows (all times Eastern and subject to change based on real-time operations):\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\nThursday, June 6\n\n9:30 a.m. - Arrival coverage begins on NASA+, the NASA app, and YouTube, and continues on NASA Television and the agency's website.\n\n12:15 p.m. - Targeted docking\n\n2 p.m. - Hatch opening\n\n2:20 p.m. - Welcome remarks\n\n3:30 p.m. - Post-docking news conference at NASA Johnson with the following participants:\n\nNASA Associate Administrator Jim FreeSteve Stich, manager, NASA's Commercial Crew ProgramJeff Arend, manager for systems engineering and integration, NASA's International Space Station OfficeMark Nappi, vice president and program manager, Commercial Crew Program, Boeing\n\nCoverage of the post-docking news conference will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\n5:50 p.m. - NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, Associate Administrator Jim Free, Associate Administrator for Space Operations Ken Bowersox, and Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche will speak with Wilmore and Williams about their launch aboard the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nCoverage of the Earth to space call will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\nSaturday, June 8\n\n8:50 a.m. - NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams will provide a tour of Starliner.\n\nCoverage of the in-orbit event will stream live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\nMonday, June 10\n\n11 a.m. - Williams will speak to students from Sunita L. Williams Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts, in an event aboard the space station.\n\nCoverage of the Earth to space call will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\nTuesday, June 11\n\n3:15 p.m. - Wilmore will speak to students from Tennessee Tech University in an event aboard the space station.\n\nCoverage of the Earth to space call will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\nMeet NASA's Crew\n\nWilmore is the commander for the mission. A veteran of two spaceflights, Wilmore has 178 days in space under his belt. In 2009, he served as a pilot aboard space shuttle Atlantis for the STS-129 mission. Additionally, Wilmore served as a flight engineer for Expedition 41 until November 2014, when he assumed command of the space station after arrival of the Expedition 42 crew. He returned to Earth the following March. Prior to his selection by NASA in 2000, the father of two obtained both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, before graduating with another master's degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, and has completed four operational deployments during his tenure as a fleet naval officer and aviator.\n\nWilliams is the spacecraft pilot for the flight test. Williams has spent 322 days in space across two missions: Expedition 14/15 in 2006 through 2007, and Expedition 32/33 in 2012. The Massachusetts native also conducted seven spacewalks, totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes. Before her career began with NASA in 1998, Williams graduated with her bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, before obtaining her master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. In total, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program has delivered on its goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station from the United States through a partnership with American private industry. This partnership is changing the arc of human spaceflight history by opening access to low Earth orbit and the space station to more people, science, and commercial opportunities. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in space exploration, including future missions to the Moon under Artemis and, eventually, Mars.\n\n/Public Release.

Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe single-engine Atlas V upper stage was expected to separate from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight and carry the Starliner farther into space, where it was due to separate from the upper stage about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at ISS after a flight of about 24 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [],

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are the latest astronauts to debut a new spacecraft. Williams has also made history as the first woman to perform such a feat.\n\nSailing through suborbital space at a whopping 17,500 miles per hour, northward along the U.S. East Coast and towards Ireland, Calypso's launch marked only the sixth time NASA astronauts debuted a new spacecraft. Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle, SpaceX Crew Dragon, and now Boeing Starliner.\n\nCalypso will introduce a backup plan for the U.S. to launch its astronauts into low-Earth orbit. When the Space Shuttle retired in 2011, NASA spearheaded its current Commercial Crew program. Two companies, Boeing and SpaceX, received contracts in 2014 to develop and build out human-rated spacecraft that could deliver NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) efficiently and at low-cost. SpaceX performed its first crewed test in 2020. Now, almost exactly four years later, Boeing is doing its own Crew Flight Test.\n\nAt 10:52 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday, Starliner finally lifted off the launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Williams and Wilmore are heading to the ISS for an eight day stay, and will then land in the U.S. southwest. Williams is now the first woman to test fly a new spacecraft.\n\nJust before reaching Mach 1, about 45 seconds into flight, Calypso experienced Max Q. That's the moment the spacecraft experiences the greatest dynamic pressure.\n\nCalypso launched atop a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket.

The first launch attempt on May 6 was scrubbed due to a valve problem on the Atlas V. Subsequent reviews revealed helium leaks in the Starliner module capsule.

International Space Station.\n\nA United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is scheduled to propel the spacecraft toward the space station from the Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 10:52 a.m. EDT.\n\nNASA will livestream the launch on the agency's website, YouTube channel, the NASA app, NASA Television and the NASA+ APP.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are conducting prelaunch procedures, coordinated by launch control teams in Houston and Florida.\n\n\"Boeing engineers and technicians closed the hatch to the CST-100 Starliner after ensuring NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were safely secured in their seats ahead of launch,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"Mission operators will conduct leak checks on the capsule to prove the hatch has a tight seal and is holding pressure.\"\n\nIt's the latest attempt to launch the crewed Starliner flight after several delays and two scrubbed launches.\n\nA power distribution source failed Saturday to end the most recent launch attempt.\n\nNASA said that was an issue in \"a single ground power supply within one of the three redundant chassis that provides power to a subset of

The crewed mission aims to dock with the ISS, a significant milestone after prior delays. This launch is crucial for Boeing's ambitions in the space sector.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew were headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), two years after the Starliner completed its first test voyage to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth. Boeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer. On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe single-engine Atlas V upper stage was expected to separate from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight and carry the Starliner farther into space, where it was due to separate from the upper stage about 15 minutes later. The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth. Boeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard. The longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with NASA funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the moon under the U.S. space agency's Artemis program. Starliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at ISS after a flight of about 24 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Although Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice maneuvering the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of having two different U.S. rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

The mission is the first crewed orbital test flight for Boeing following two previous demonstrations that were conducted with no astronauts on board.\n\nNASA, which provided live coverage of Saturday's launch, is expected to provide coverage of the landing as well.\n\nHere's what to know about the mission.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft was perched atop the Atlas V rocket when it launched at 10:52 a.m. ET Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Starliner will dock Thursday morning on the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module. Once it reaches the space station in less than 24 hours, crew will spend a little more than a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth.\n\nThe craft will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the space station.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts on board the Starliner for Monday's launch are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, both Navy test pilots who have ventured to space twice before.\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe follow-up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple issues as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later on, Florida Today reported.\n\nA successful mission would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion and SpaceX was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecrafts capable of making crewed scientific trips to low-Earth orbit, Florida Today reported.\n\nUnder NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nIn March, SpaceX had its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket needed to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo era. While in orbit, the Starship hit several key milestones and conducted a handful of in-flight tests that are a crucial step forward for it to be reliable and functional in time for Artemis III, slated for sometime in 2026.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched March 3 and docked March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to NASA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

(AP) -- Boeing geared up again today for its first astronaut launch, held up for years by safety concerns.\n\nIt was the third launch attempt for NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in Boeing's Starliner capsule. Rocket-related trouble thwarted the first two countdowns.\n\nThe astronauts will test Starliner's systems on the way to the International Space Station, where they'll spend at least a week before aiming for a touchdown in the western U.S.\n\nNASA hired Boeing along with SpaceX after the space shuttles retired to transport astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020.\n\nBoeing's capsule rocketed into orbit in 2019 without a crew, but that test flight was cut short by software problems. Boeing had better luck on the do-over mission in 2022, but parachute and other issues later were discovered, delaying Starliner's crew debut even further.\n\nMinutes before Saturday's planned liftoff, a computer's power unit failed at the pad that had to be replaced by rocket maker United Launch Alliance. And a bad valve inside the Atlas V rocket scrapped the launch attempt in early May.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Williams is also on her third flight to space and will be the first woman on a test flight in an orbital spacecraft, according to NASA.\n\nAfter Starliner launches into orbit, it will be about a 24-hour journey to the ISS, during which the crew will test several flight objects, such as checking equipment, according to NASA.\n\nBoeing Space said Wilmore and Williams will pilot Starline manually at certain points to prove it can, despite the spacecraft being able to operate autonomously.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are expected to spend one week aboard the ISS and will be evaluating the spacecraft and its systems. Upon re-entry, the spacecraft will deploy parachutes and an airbag system, landing the pair in the western U.S.\n\nIt comes after the launch of Starliner was delayed several times. The crewed flight test was tentatively scheduled for May 6, but was scrubbed after a problem with an oxygen valve on the ULA rocket.\n\nA new launch date had been set for May 25, but a small helium leak was discovered in the service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating a spacecraft.\n\nAnother launch set for June 2 was scrubbed minutes before it was due to begin \"due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count.\"\n\nAfter Starliner launches into orbit, it will be about a 24-hour journey to the ISS, during which the crew will test several flight objects, such as checking equipment, according to NASA.\n\nIf the mission is successful, NASA could certify the spacecraft to perform routine missions to and from the ISS. NASA has primarily been using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport crew and cargo to the ISS.\n\nThe missions are part of the larger Commercial Crew Program at NASA, which uses American rockets and spacecraft to launch astronauts and cargo to the ISS with the hope of helping the federal space agency prepare for its upcoming moon and Mars missions.", "source": {"uri": "mix1027.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cumulus cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryogenic fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human mission to Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 82}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2446, "textEnd": 2451}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2562, "textEnd": 2568}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 2731, "textEnd": 2737}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western US on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station.\n\nBack at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded.\n\nAfter all the trouble leading up to the launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nStarliner's crew debut, which was years delayed because of spacecraft laws, comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its plane side of the business.\n\nWilmore and Williams - retired Navy captains and former space station residents - stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight.\n\nStarliner's initial test flight in 2019, which left without a crew and was crippled by bad software, had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in.\n\nThe 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently happening last weekend.\n\nA small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavour to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nThe space agency wanted two competing US companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion (\u00a33.28 billion) to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries - Russia, the US and China - had mastered.\n\nIt has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable.\n\nWilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nThe only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system.\n\nMore water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit.\n\nThe tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year.\n\nThe backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighbouring Kennedy Space Centre.\n\n\"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"", "source":

Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts.\n\nA May 6 countdown was halted two hours before lift-off over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny.\n\nAnother try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before lift-off because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts:\n\nWilmore, 61, a retired US navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each.\n\nWilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nThey are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $US1.5 billion ($A2.3 billion) over budget.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon.\n\nBut Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The federal agency's initiative aims to foster collaboration with private industry partners.\n\nThe flight marks only the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a May news conference.\n\n\"It started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX's) Dragon -- and now Starliner,\" Nelson said.\n\nWilliams also made history as the first woman to fly aboard such a mission.\n\n\"This is another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA,\" Nelson said Wednesday after the launch. \"And I want to give my personal congratulations to the whole team that went through a lot of trial and tribulation. But they had perseverance and that's what we do at NASA. We don't launch until it's right.\"\n\nThe astronauts will spend just over 24 hours traveling to the space station.\n\nAfter docking around 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday, Williams and Wilmore are set to spend eight days living in the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board.\n\nAboard Starliner is a crucial pump needed to fix the space station's urine processor assembly, which failed on May 29.\n\n\"That urine processor takes all of the crew's urine and processes it in the first step of a water recovery system,\" said Dana Weigel, manager for NASA's International Space Station Program. \"It then sends it downstream to a water processor which turns it into drinking water. The station's really designed to be a closed loop.\"\n\nNow, the urine has to be stored onboard in containers, so Starliner's anticipated arrival to the space station can't come soon enough.\n\n\"On the pump change, we're gonna get to that as soon as we can,\" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate. \"My hope is we get to it this week. If not, it'll be early next week.\"\n\nThe astronauts will test various aspects of Starliner's capabilities, including the spacecraft's thruster performance, how their spacesuits function within the capsule, and manual piloting in case the crew needs to override the spacecraft's autopilot.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will also test Starliner's \"safe haven\" capability, designed to offer the space station crew a shelter if there is a problem, according to Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, during a May 31 news conference.\n\nWhen it's time to head home, the astronauts will return using the same Starliner capsule and parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.\n\nNASA officials shared that astronauts Williams and Wilmore may enjoy a slightly extended stay aboard the station. The earliest possible landing date is June 14.\n\n\"We've got a prescribed landing date that goes along with this launch date, but I just want to emphasize that nobody should get too excited about that date,\" said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate. \"We have to have a lot of conditions that are just right before we bring the Starliner home and we're going to wait till the conditions are right and we've accomplished the test objectives before we do that.\"\n\nThe only issue mission teams are assessing is a system called a sublimator on Starliner, which provides cooling during the launch and landing phase, Stich added.\n\n\"What that does is it creates a block of ice essentially,\" he said. \"And then as heat is passed into that icebox, a little thin layer of that ice turns into a vapor and that rejects heat away. We used a little bit more water than we expected.\"\n\nThe team will assess data of the sublimator to learn more about how the system is functioning.\n\nYears of development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner's path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing's competitor under NASA's Commercial Crew Program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.\n\nWhen asked about the relationship between Boeing and SpaceX, long viewed as a rivalry, Mark Nappi, the vice president and program manager of the Commercial Crew Program for Boeing, said he believes others see it as a competition.\n\n\"We don't see it as a competition,\" Nappi said. \"We've got two providers that are going up to the International Space Station and SpaceX is up there, and we're up there now as well. So, this is something that NASA has planned and we've accomplished it.\"\n\nThis mission could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing's Starliner spacecraft ready for routine operations to deliver astronauts and cargo to the space station.\n\nOnce Starliner is certified, the US will have two ways of reaching the International Space Station, which was why the Commercial Crew Program was started in the first place, Nelson said.\n\n\"And when we expand our fleet of spacecraft, what we're doing is expanding our reach to the stars,\" Nelson said.\n\nA number of issues caused the previous crewed launch attempts, on May 6 and June 1, to be scrubbed.\n\nTwo hours prior to the launch attempt on May 6, engineers identified an issue with a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket, which was built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The entire stack, including the rocket and spacecraft, was rolled back from the launchpad for testing and repairs.\n\nTeams also worked through a small helium leak within the spacecraft service module, a \"design vulnerability\" in the propulsion system and assessed the parachutes for the Starliner capsule.\n\nStarliner was just 3 minutes and 50 seconds from liftoff Saturday afternoon, when an automatic hold was triggered by the ground launch sequencer, or the computer that launches the rocket.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance technicians and engineers assessed the ground support equipment over the weekend, examining three large computers housed inside a shelter at the base of the launchpad. Each computer is the same, providing triple redundancy to ensure the safe launch of crewed missions.\n\n\"Imagine a large rack that is a big computer where the functions of the computer as a controller are broken up separately into individual cards or printed wire circuit boards,\" said Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United Launch Alliance, during a Saturday news conference. \"They're all stand-alone, but together, it's an integrated controller.\"\n\nThe cards within the computers are responsible for different key systems that must occur before a launch, such as releasing bolts at the rocket's base so it can lift off after ignition.\n\nDuring the final four minutes before launch, all three computers must communicate and agree with one another. But during Saturday's countdown, a card on one of the computers was six seconds slower in responding than the other two computers, indicating that something was not correct and triggering an automatic hold, according to Bruno.\n\nOver the weekend, engineers evaluated the computers, their power supply and network communications between the computers. The team isolated the issue to a single ground power supply within one of the computers, which provides power to the computer cards responsible for key countdown events -- including the replenishment valves for the rocket's upper stage, which also caused an issue during the countdown, according to an update shared by NASA.\n\nStarliner teams reported no signs of physical damage to the computer, which they removed and replaced with a spare. The other computers and their cards were also assessed, and all of them are performing normally as expected, according to the ULA team.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

'Orlando Sentinel' reports that NASA's Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have twice climbed on board the Starliner in the last month...\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLittle Chicago Deli reopens in Sioux City Friday Sioux City Marina operator responds to city's lawsuit SUX Pride creating a festive something for everybody event in Sioux City Woodbury County Court Report for May 28, 2024 Mary Jo (Sailors) McInnis East's Mackenzie Crawford is Broadway-bound for a chance at the Jimmys Athlete of the Week: A budding star emerging for SB-L in Moreau Fatal hit-and-run suspect returned to Sioux City, faces 4 charges Day-long, downtown event highlights 'So Much To Do' in Sioux City Boys state soccer: Heelan captures first state title with OT win over Assumption Nebraska baseball's NCAA tournament run continues after Huskers eliminate Niagara Parents of another Hinton wrestler sue coaches, school for alleged assaults Greenwell's attorney response to $53,000 fees in Gausman lawsuit, stating it should be halved Woman believed to be dead turns out to be alive at Nebraska funeral home, officials say Nelson, McNaughton seek Woodbury County Supervisors seat\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

United Launch Alliance (ULA) is now targeting a launch at 12:52 a.m. AEST on Thursday, June 6. The weather forecast shows a 90% chance of favourable weather conditions for launch. You can tune in to the live feed below.\n\nThe crewed Starliner spacecraft is scheduled to dock at the forward-facing port of the ISS's Harmony module at roughly 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 6.\n\nOriginal article follows.\n\nDespite several delays and technical hiccups, Boeing is getting ready to launch its first crewed test flight to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of its agreement with NASA.\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft is set for launch on Saturday, June 1 at 12:25 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The crew capsule will ride atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket, carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station and back.\n\nNASA will broadcast the launch live on its website and the space agency's YouTube channel. The launch coverage will begin at 8:15 a.m. ET. Boeing will also be airing the launch live through its website.\n\nIt's been a nail-biting journey to make it to this point, and frankly the upcoming launch has us quite anxious. The company was originally targeting May 6 for the liftoff of Starliner but a last minute anomaly with one of the Atlas V rocket's pressure valves delayed the crewed test flight to May 17. Just days before the launch, however, Starliner teams detected a small helium leak in the spacecraft's service module, prompting them to push the launch to May 21 before it was delayed indefinitely.\n\nEarlier this week, Boeing announced that it decided to proceed with flying the astronaut crew on the leaky Starliner spacecraft without resolving the issue. Boeing's vice president Mark Nappi said that fixing the leak would require taking apart the Starliner spacecraft at its factory, AFP reported. Instead, Starliner teams will monitor the leak ahead of the launch on Saturday.\n\nBoeing's Crewed Flight Test is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program and is meant to transport crew and cargo to and from the International Space Station (ISS) under a $US4.3 billion contract with the space agency. NASA's other commercial partner, SpaceX, just launched its eighth crew to the space station.\n\nStarliner's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 managed to reach space, but a software automation glitch caused the spacecraft to burn excess fuel, preventing it from making it to the ISS. Starliner miscalculated its location in space due to a glitch caused by a faulty mission elapsed timer.\n\nThe botched first flight prompted NASA to call for a second test flight of the empty spacecraft before a crew rides on board. In May 2022, Boeing completed the Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2), the second uncrewed test flight of Starliner, setting the stage for a crewed test flight. But OFT-2 suffered a few hiccups, including the failure of a thruster used for orbital maneuvering.\n\nBoeing's crewed Starliner launch was initially set for February 2023, then postponed to late April, and finally rescheduled for July 21, 2023. A few weeks before liftoff, however, the company announced that it was standing down from the launch attempt to address newfound issues with the crew vehicle, including a mile's worth of flammable tape that had to be manually removed.\n\nDespite all of these failures, NASA remains dedicated to the Starliner program and having two commercial partners transporting its astronauts to low Earth orbit. With the leaky spacecraft, Saturday's launch is a major test of NASA's relationship with its entourage of private companies.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "passant_rabie@gizmodo.com.au", "name": "Passant Rabie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Orbital Flight Test 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/e362b38ad213a87d740e2cb0fbc4993a_f142e8.jpg?quality=75", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 22, "textEnd": 28, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 227, "textEnd": 233, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1382, "textEnd": 1387}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1526, "textEnd": 1532}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1690, "textEnd": 1696}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to fly astronauts to the ISS with commercial spacecraft.\n\nThe first launch attempt on May 6 ended in a scrub due to a faulty oxygen valve on the rocket, but a problem with a helium leak on the spacecraft ultimately delayed the flight into June.\n\nA second launch attempt also ended in a scrub after a computer issue on the launchpad. ULA was able to replace the problem part over the weekend, allowing the launch to happen on Wednesday.\n\nWednesday's historic flight marked the sixth new orbital spacecraft and the first new vehicle with a female crew.\n\nWilliams said she had the privilege of naming \"this little tough bird\" Calypso, after explorer Jacques Cousteau's ship.\n\n\"I thought it was appropriate that this spacecraft is going to take a lot of people up to the space station for exploration,\" she said before launch.\n\nAbout 13 minutes into their flight, the astronauts reached orbit for the fourth time in their careers. Both former U.S. Navy test pilots and veteran astronauts, they have a combined nearly 500 hours in space.\n\nThere were subtle differences between Boeing's first human spaceflight and the astronauts who launched with SpaceX over the past four years.\n\nCrews helped Wilmore and Williams put on their \"Boeing Blue\" flight suits. SpaceX and Boeing both designed custom suits for each company's spacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts rode out to the launchpad in the new Astrovan II. A ride to the launchpad in an Airstream van is a tradition that dates back to the first human spaceflights.\n\nWilmore told reporters that they planned to watch some of \"Top Gun Maverick\" on their way to the rocket. Both astronauts are retired Navy captains and test pilots.\n\n\"It's got cushioned seats, and, of course, it's got a big video screen in the back. And as you would expect, two Navy pilots. You know what movie we put on,\" Wilmore said. \"They edited out and put only in the flying scenes and the dramatic scenes.\"\n\n\"Butch and Suni\" also launched from a different launchpad than the SpaceX Crew Dragon lifts off from. The Atlas V launches from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station side of Florida's spaceport, where the SpaceX Falcon 9 launches humans from Kennedy Space Center launchpad 39A.\n\nThe Atlas V rocket roared to life, sending the Starliner and its crew into space, marking the first human spaceflight for both the spacecraft and the rocket. Despite 100 launches for ULA's workhorse rocket, the first human spaceflight comes toward the end of its successful career as the company transitions to its new Vulcan rocket.\n\nThe crew will test drive the Starliner in manual mode and perform some checkouts before getting some sleep while in orbit.\n\n\"Butch and Suni\" are scheduled to dock at the International Space Station at 12:15 p.m. on Thursday where the five astronauts and two cosmonauts will be waiting to greet them.\n\nA successful test flight will culminate about a week later when Starliner returns to Earth, landing in the Southwest desert and safely bringing the astronauts home.\n\nBoeing's CFT comes four years after SpaceX first launched two NASA astronauts to the space station, ending U.S. reliance on Russia for transport to the orbiting laboratory after the space shuttle program ended. SpaceX is preparing for its ninth flight with a NASA crew this summer.\n\nBoeing's journey to develop and certify the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft has faced delays over the past 10 years, since NASA selected two companies to develop spacecraft to fly astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nNASA Associated Administrator Jim Free said it's important to have two different vehicles for launches to the ISS.\n\n\"Which means if we have a problem with either, we have a way to get our crew to the station,\" Free said.\n\nThe company took two tries to complete the orbital flight test when the first attempt to launch a crewless Starliner in 2019 failed to reach the ISS due to a computer timing error.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"},

(AP) - Boeing geared up again Wednesday for its first astronaut launch, held up for years by safety concerns.\n\nIt was the third launch attempt for NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in Boeing\u00b4s Starliner capsule. Rocket-related trouble thwarted the first two countdowns.\n\nThe astronauts will test Starliner\u00b4s systems on the way to the International Space Station, where they'll spend at least a week before aiming for a touchdown in the western U.S.\n\nNASA hired Boeing along with SpaceX after the space shuttles retired to transport astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020.\n\nBoeing's capsule rocketed into orbit in 2019 without a crew, but that test flight was cut short by software problems. Boeing had better luck on the do-over mission in 2022, but parachute and other issues later were discovered, delaying Starliner's crew debut even further.\n\nMinutes before Saturday's planned liftoff, a computer's power unit failed at the pad that had to be replaced by rocket maker United Launch Alliance.

Roughly half an hour after launch, Starliner fired its thrusters and reached a stable orbit -- achieving a long-awaited milestone for the program.\n\n\"You're seeing lots of happy faces and cheers,\" Brandi Dean, a public affairs officer at NASA, said on a live webcast. \"Everybody is glad to see Starliner is safely in orbit.\"\n\nThe drama-free launch provided some rare good news for Boeing, which has been grappling with a crisis centered on its marquee 737 Max jetliner.\n\nBoeing shares pared earlier losses and were up less than 1% at 1:20 p.m. in New York.\n\nStarliner will perform a series of maneuvers to put it on course to link up with the space station around 12:15 p.m. Florida time on Thursday for a roughly week-long stay.\n\nWednesday's test is the culmination of years of delays caused by technical glitches and failures with the Starliner craft. Those include an earlier botched 2019 test flight and fresh concerns over the past month of a still-unresolved helium leak NASA is monitoring throughout the mission.\n\nNASA is using the flight to prove Starliner can safely carry people to and from the ISS under the US space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\n\"Today, it all lined up,\" Boeing executive Mark Nappi told reporters after the morning launch, noting a \"perfect countdown and launch.\" But Nappi laid out several key milestones before the vehicle is certified for regular spaceflight. Those include docking and undocking at the orbiting research laboratory and the capsule's safe return to Earth.\n\nIn 2014, NASA awarded Boeing $4.2 billion and Elon Musk's SpaceX $2.6 billion to create vehicles to ferry the agency's astronauts to space. While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule, SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nWhile this test is largely focused on Starliner, it was also an important moment for ULA. The Atlas V rocket had 99 previous successful launches before it ever carried astronauts. Boeing is also one of two parent companies of ULA, along with rival Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\n\"We are very proud to join the human spaceflight community,\" ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno told reporters.\n\nBoeing and NASA first tried to launch on May 6, but the flight was halted hours before takeoff due to an oddly behaving pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket. Boeing further delayed the launch by a few weeks to investigate the helium leak.\n\nA June 1 attempt was called off less than four minutes before takeoff after a launch computer needed for the final stages of flight was slow to respond.\n\nDespite the earlier setbacks, the mission appeared to go off without a hitch. But NASA said it was keeping an eye on so-called sublimators used to cool the vehicle down during the flight. The components are running out of water a little more quickly than expected, but Starliner's radiators should be able to take over, mitigating the problem.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's launch, Wilmore noted the American flags he'd seen earlier that day, including on the Atlas V rocket itself.\n\n\"We think that represents unity and resilience and unified efforts for the common good,\" he said minutes before the launch. \"Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you.\"\n\n(Updates with details from post-launch news conference.)", "source": {"uri":

It's the first time Boeing has launched astronauts into space, and the first time a woman has flown a trial of a new orbital spacecraft.\n\nEvery astronaut vehicle that has blasted off from U.S. soil since the beginning of the Space Age has experienced a nail-biting maiden voyage. It is a relief every time a crew safely reaches orbit, especially on a test flight. But the initial success of this mission is particularly comforting because the astronauts are flying on Boeing's creation, whose debut was delayed by a series of issues. On this first crewed launch, Boeing has proved that it is not a disaster. But its triumph will lead only to more nail biters. To show it is reliable, Starliner will have to bring the astronauts home a little over a week from now, and then repeat the whole endeavor.\n\nThe troubles of Boeing, the airplane manufacturer, have not reflected kindly on Boeing, the builder of spacecraft. Over the past couple of months, NASA has fielded questions from reporters about whether the mountain of safety issues at the company's airline division has spilled over into the space department. Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, has told reporters that Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has previously assured him about the quality of the leadership at Boeing's space division. (Calhoun is the second Boeing chief to step down in five years because of the turmoil.)\n\nBoeing has a long history as a space contractor -- it worked on Apollo rockets, the space station, and many projects in between. It's also the primary contractor for NASA's newest rocket, the Space Launch System, which is scheduled to launch astronauts toward the moon later this decade. With Starliner, Boeing is attempting to prove that it can deliver the nation's astronauts to the space station and back by itself -- and keep up with SpaceX, which has been doing the job since 2020. The effort has had its own share of technical problems and oversights, including in the past few weeks.\n\nWhen NASA retired its fleet of space shuttles, in 2011, the space agency turned to the private sector for transporting people to and from the International Space Station, and soon after gave Boeing and SpaceX billion-dollar contracts to develop their own crewed systems. When the companies weren't carrying government workers, they could sell seats to private citizens, a service that SpaceX has completed several times. SpaceX beat Boeing to the launchpad for an uncrewed test flight of its Dragon capsule, in 2019, which was mostly smooth from start to finish. But when Boeing followed later that year, the attempt had to be cut short. Starliner's flight software malfunctioned soon after launch, and on the way down, engineers found and quickly patched a software glitch that would have resulted in complete failure of the mission -- and, if any astronauts had been on board, the loss of lives.\n\nAfter spending a year and a half wringing out software bugs, Boeing prepared in 2021 for a second attempt, only to discover more than a dozen corroded valves on the spacecraft as it sat waiting on top of the rocket. In 2022, Starliner finally made it to the International Space Station and back, but before Boeing could attempt a crewed flight, it had to address newly found problems with Starliner's parachute system, as well as tape within the spacecraft that testing revealed to be flammable. Boeing finally felt ready enough to bring astronauts on board early last month, but the launch attempt was canceled hours before liftoff because of a faulty valve on the rocket. (The rocket, from the manufacturer United Launch Alliance, is used frequently, but it had never flown astronauts before today.) Over the next several weeks, engineers encountered more problems with Starliner itself, but by Saturday, NASA and Boeing felt ready to try again. \"All is going well,\" Mark Nappi, the manager of Boeing's commercial-spaceflight program, said at a prelaunch press conference last week. But Starliner was grounded once again; an issue with a launchpad computer this time, and it turned up less than four minutes before the scheduled liftoff, when the astronauts and everyone watching likely believed that they were finally going\n\nLike the officials, the astronauts now flying on Starliner have stressed that the crewed mission may experience some problems. \"Flying and operating in space is hard. It's really hard, and we're going to find some stuff,\" Wilmore told reporters in March. Officials said the same about SpaceX's first few crewed Dragon missions, but SpaceX's launches weren't preceded by quite so much bad press or quite so many glitches.\n\nWilmore and Williams are scheduled to arrive at the space station tomorrow. Along the way, the astronauts will briefly take control of the Boeing craft and see how it handles. Then Starliner must dock with the space station and later endure a fiery reentry through Earth's atmosphere to touch down in the western United States, ideally at the primary landing site in the New Mexico desert. Starliner must pass each of these tests before NASA certifies the vehicle for regular flights, with more than two astronauts at a time, to the space station.\n\nSpaceX underwent the same process in 2020 with its own inaugural crewed flight. By now NASA astronauts have flown on SpaceX often enough that it's hardly a blip on space watchers' radar. But the first few crewed flights on Dragon were all nerve-racking. The same will be true for Boeing's Starliner. Boeing, in other words, is about to be tested publicly again and again. The writer Jerry Useem recently observed in The Atlantic that Boeing's decisions in commercial air travel have in recent years turned \"the company that created the Jet Age into something akin to a glorified gluer-together of precast model-airplane kits.\" Another truncated space mission would certainly ding Boeing, and a major failure could turn a company that helped define the Space Age into an emblem of constant calamity.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marina_koren@theatlantic.com", "name": "Marina Koren", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

The astronauts will spend 25 hours aboard Starliner on their way to the ISS, becoming the first crew ever to ride the newly developed spacecraft into orbit, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com.\n\nStarliner has faced numerous delays on its way to this first crewed mission. The original launch date was scheduled for May 6 -- however, it was scrubbed roughly two hours before liftoff due to an issue with a buzzing oxygen valve on the ULA Atlas V rocket meant to carry Starliner into space. The launch was rescheduled for June 1; however, this attempt was aborted minutes before liftoff due to a computer glitch in a ground launch sequencer, according to Space.com.\n\nrelated stories\n\n-- NASA set to launch 2 rockets into the northern lights\n\n-- China discovers strange glass beads on moon that may contain billions of tons of water\n\n-- 3-ton rocket that will smash into the moon Friday is from China, astronomer argues\n\nYou can watch the latest launch attempt in the NASA live stream above.

It was the 100th Atlas V launch, but the first with people at the pointy end of a version of that rocket modified for human spaceflight.\n\nThe vehicle's two RD-180 liquid-fueled engines ignited seconds before T-0, followed by two small solid-fueled rocket boosters that combined to send the rocket sprinting into a mostly clear sky. Starliner proceeded smoothly through SRB burnout and jettison, first-stage cutoff, separation, and then a burn of the Atlas V's Centaur second stage to take it to the verge of orbit.\n\nFifteen minutes after Starliner left Earth, the spacecraft was flying free in space -- which, as NASA's commentators noted, allowed the astronauts to put aside printed checklists and break out tablet computers.\n\nWilmore radioed down a message to ULA, formed in 2006 as a joint venture between the space divisions of Lockheed Martin and Boeing: \"They've been a member of the family for a long time, but now it's official, and we want to welcome them to human spaceflight.\"\n\nA brief burn of Starliner's own engines 30 minutes after launch took it the rest of the way to orbit. The capsule that Williams christened Calypso now heads to the International Space Station for a scheduled docking at 12:15 Eastern on Thursday. Its cargo includes a urine processor to extract potable water to replace a broken ISS unit.\n\nThe mission schedule calls for the two astronauts to spend eight days on the ISS, then return to Earth to land under parachutes and cushioned by airbags on one of a few designated desert landing sites in the western United States.\n\nThis successful debut of the spacecraft Boeing designed and built under a fixed-price contract for NASA gives the beleaguered Arlington, Va., aerospace company a break from a series of self-inflicted wounds, including an improperly installed door plug getting blown out of an Alaska Airlines-operated 737 Max 9.\n\nA Win for Boeing\n\nIt also makes the United States the first country that can choose which model of spacecraft its astronauts fly to orbit from its soil -- in addition to the Russian Soyuz capsules that continue to carry astronauts and cosmonauts to the ISS and back.\n\nWednesday's launch followed two scrubs. Flight controllers called off a May 6 attempt because of an issue with a liquid-oxygen valve on the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage, then delayed it further to troubleshoot small helium leaks in Starliner's maneuvering engines. Then a glitch with one of the computers sequencing a June 1 launch attempt scrubbed it with only three minutes and 50 seconds left in the countdown.\n\nUnder NASA's original vision, Starliner might have flown seven years ago. After the agency resisted Congressional pressure to hand a single crew-transportation contract to Boeing and instead picked both Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft -- a $4.2 billion award to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX -- NASA projected a first flight in 2017.\n\nThe smaller sum awarded to SpaceX has been money vastly better spent, with SpaceX's Crew Dragon returning astronaut launches to American soil after an almost nine-year gap with its May 30, 2020, crewed mission to the ISS. Meanwhile, Boeing's costs have rocketed past that fixed-price award, with the company reporting last June that its losses had hit almost $1.5 billion.\n\nStarliner's first uncrewed launch in 2019 suffered a series of serious software problems that left it unable to dock with the ISS and could have resulted in the loss of the vehicle itself. Its second flight test, delayed after extensive work to fix valve problems, didn't happen until May 2022, after which Boeing had to replace part of the capsule's electrical wiring and tweak its parachute design.\n\n'You Always Want to Have a Backup Position'\n\nFor NASA, having Starliner as a Plan B -- even though Dragon's reliability and the reusability of booster stages on SpaceX's Falcon 9 have vindicated NASA's faith in outsourcing orbital spacecraft to private industry -- goes back to the agency's emphasis on redundancy.\n\n\"You always want to have a backup position,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a taped interview during the June 1 broadcast.\n\nStarliner can accommodate up to seven astronauts, but NASA plans to fly four to the ISS on the six operational missions it has booked after this test launch.\n\nBoeing's commercialization plans for its capsule aren't as far along as SpaceX's, which have now featured Axiom's private flights of Dragon to the ISS. But Boeing does intend to have Starliner fly to the Orbital Reef commercial space station it's developing with Sierra Space and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, supported by $172 million in funding from NASA.\n\nNASA has been sending astronauts to orbit for more than 60 years, but Starliner's liftoff was only the sixth time astronauts have flown a new vehicle to orbit from American soil, following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the Space Shuttle, and Dragon.\n\nThe expendable launch vehicle underneath Starliner itself encapsulates much of that history as well as that of the Cold War and its aftermath.\n\nThe Atlas V, a workhorse for civilian and military satellite launches since 2002, takes its name from a series of rockets that go back all of those 60-plus years. NASA's first Atlas rockets, based on a line of US Air Force ICBMs, took Mercury astronauts to orbit starting with John Glenn's launch in 1962 and represent \"Atlas V's great-grandaddy,\" as ULA CEO Tory Bruno said during NASA's June 1 coverage.\n\nDecades later, the Atlas V lifts off with RD-180 engines built in Russia -- which at the time of that rocket's design outperformed anything comparable in the States and kept ex-Soviet rocket engineers gainfully employed. But that supply chain became a liability after Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea and led ULA to develop its Vulcan rocket around Blue Origin's BE-4 engines. Vulcan flew for the first time in January.\n\nWhile some of the remaining Atlas V launches will launch Project Kuiper satellites for Amazon's low-Earth-orbit broadband service, this rocket is now set to end its career in the same way the original Atlas came to fame: sending Americans to space.", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But just two hours from liftoff for a flight destined for the International Space Station (ISS), and with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams strapped into their seats inside the spacecraft, a problem occurred that forced the countdown clock to be halted.\n\nThat time it was a valve issue on ULA's Atlas V rocket rather than an anomaly with the Starliner, but while the rocket was being repaired, a helium leak was found on Boeing's spacecraft, which meant more work needed to be done before a new launch date could be set.\n\nAnother attempt to launch the Starliner took place at the start of this month. But with a mere 3 minutes and 50 seconds left on the countdown clock, mission controllers scrubbed the launch effort after an issue with the ground system surfaced.\n\nNow the team says it's ready to go again, on Wednesday, June 5.\n\nULA president and CEO Tory Bruno said in a post on social media on Tuesday that the weather conditions for the 10:52 a.m. ET launch are looking good, meaning that barring any last-minute problem with the astronauts, it's only another technical issue that can prevent the Atlas V and Starliner from heading to orbit on Wednesday.\n\nAssuming that the rocket finally gets to fly this week, people across large parts of Florida could see the Atlas V and Starliner roaring to space. Bruno shared a map showing the viewing possibilities from different parts of the state.\n\nFor your viewing pleasure, we'll be heading up the coast for a 51.62 deg inclination. (Sunni and Butch - your ULA Uber driver, Mighty Atlas, is standing by) pic.twitter.com/l3cS5GjoZX\n\n&mdash; Tory Bruno (@torybruno) June 1, 2024\n\nAlternatively, you can watch the buildup to the mission and the launch via a live stream provided by NASA on multiple platforms.\n\nThe mission will see the Starliner dock with the International Space Station before returning about a week later for a parachute-assisted landing in New Mexico.\n\nA flawless flight will pave the way for scheduled astronaut flights to and from the ISS, and provide NASA with a spacecraft other than SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the space station orbit flights.\n\nEditors' Recommendations How to watch the first crewed flight of the Starliner spacecraft First crewed flight of the Boeing Starliner scrubbed once again

On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into sunny skies from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that starts its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nStarliner will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth. Boeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. Soil.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told a news conference that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\" \"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... We're on orbit with Butch and Suni, it's been a longtime coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each.

The launch can be viewed via the livestream below.\n\nVeteran astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are set to ride aboard Boeing's capsule, which will reach orbit atop an Atlas V rocket manufactured by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe U.S. space agency is confident in the success of the Starliner mission, named Crew Flight Test (CFT), aiming to have a second commercial vehicle for crew transport to the ISS. If the Starliner successfully launches, the astronauts will spend just over 24 hours traveling to the space station.\n\nThe primary goals of the Starliner mission are to validate the spacecraft's systems and capabilities, ensuring the safety and reliability of future missions to the ISS. The astronauts will test various aspects of Starliner's capabilities, including the spacecraft's thruster performance, the functionality of their spacesuits within the capsule, and manual piloting in case the crew needs to override the spacecraft's autopilot.\n\nOnce aboard, they will join the seven astronauts and cosmonauts currently on the ISS for an eight-day stay. During this time, they will conduct various tests and evaluations and repair the space station's urine processor assembly, which failed on May 29. The Starliner carries a crucial pump needed to fix it.\n\nWhen it's time to head home, the astronauts will return using the same Starliner capsule and parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern U.S. This return process is intended to further demonstrate the spacecraft's ability to safely bring crew members back to Earth.\n\nBoeing's spacecraft, which has been years in the making, has faced multiple issues and delays, causing it to fall behind Elon Musk's SpaceX -- currently the only option for American astronauts since the end of the Shuttle program more than a decade ago.\n\nA number of issues caused the previous crewed launch attempts, on May 6 and June 1, to be scrubbed. Two hours prior to the launch attempt on May 6, engineers identified an issue after a persistent helium leak forced NASA to scrub the launch at the last minute.\n\nWeeks later, when everything looked set for the expected lift-off on Saturday, one of the spacecraft's three redundant computers failed to synchronize with the others just 3 minutes and 50 seconds before liftoff.\n\nIf it passes this final test mission, the Starliner will join the Crew Dragon as one of two space vehicles capable of carrying humans for NASA missions in orbit.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

The historic liftoff took place at 10:52 a.m. ET from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, with the weather being 90% favorable for the launch, ABC News reported.\n\nThe Starliner, designed to carry a seven-person crew, embarked on its \"test drive\" with NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, commanding the flight, and Sunita Williams, 58, piloting. Both astronauts are veterans, with this being their third mission to space. Williams is also making history as the first woman to pilot a test flight in an orbital spacecraft.\n\nThe launch was a significant milestone for Boeing, which was contracted by NASA along with SpaceX to transport astronauts to the ISS following the retirement of the space shuttles. According to CBS News, The Starliner's journey to the ISS is expected to take about 24 hours, during which the crew will test various flight objectives, including manual piloting of the spacecraft.\n\nThe successful launch comes after several setbacks, including a problem with an oxygen valve on the ULA rocket, a small helium leak in the service module, and an issue with the computer ground launch sequencer. Despite these challenges, the Starliner and its crew are now on their way to the ISS, where they plan to spend a week evaluating the spacecraft and its systems.\n\nUpon completion of their mission, the Starliner will return to Earth, deploying parachutes and an airbag system for landing in the western U.S. If the test flight is successful, NASA could certify the Starliner for routine missions to and from the ISS. This would mark a significant step forward in NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which aims to prepare for future moon and Mars missions.\n\nThe Starliner's launch is also noteworthy as it marks the first time in six decades that a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket has carried astronauts into space. The workhorse Atlas 5, with its Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine and two strap-on solid fuel boosters, majestically climbed skyward, generating 1.6 million pounds of thrust.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "litty_simon@ibtimes.com", "name": "Litty Simon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human mission to Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-propellant_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solid-propellant rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-180", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RD-180"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbag"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4524739/boeing-starliner-capsule-atop-atlas-v-rocket-sits-launchpad-cape-canaveral-florida-may-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Mission control declared a \"scrub\" after an anomaly was detected on an oxygen relief valve on the Centaur Stage on the Atlas V rocket. The Starliner was rolled off the pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. After four delays, Boeing tried again to launch its high-anticipated first crewed mission of the Starliner on Saturday, June 1, but a ground launch sequencer computer triggered the automatic abort.\n\nThe new launch target is now June 5, 10:52 a.m. Starliner also has one more backup launch date on June 6 before ULA and Boeing would have to stand down for 10 days or so to swap out vehicle batteries, Boeing officials have said.\n\nCrew Flight Test mission will send two veteran NASA astronauts, Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, pilot, and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, commander of the mission, to the International Space Station. This mission is a critical step for the program as it aims to showcase the Starliner's capabilities. The test flight will demonstrate the team's readiness to join Space X's Dragon vehicle in being NASA certified and fly long-duration missions for the agency. A successful flight from launch to land would provide the U.S. with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to low-Earth orbit.\n\nHow does the Boeing's Atlas V N22 and SpaceX Falcon 9 compare?\n\nHow does the Starliner compare to Crew Dragon capsule?\n\nWhere does the Starliner launch from?\n\nThe Starliner is set to launch from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This site has previously been used for hosting Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur launches by the United Launch Alliance and for Titan III and Titan IV launches by the United States Air Force.\n\nIn Florida, SpaceX launches from LC-39A for NASA and SLC-40 for United States Space Force national security launches\n\nWhere does Starliner capsule dock on the International Space Station?\n\nBoeing's first uncrewed Starliner capsule successfully docked to the International Space Station on May 20, 2022. 24 hours after launch, the two astronauts on the Starliner will arrive at the ISS. The Starliner will rendezvous and dock with the ISS autonomously. Camera's on the Starliner will spot the ISS and drift closer and closer while hundreds of finely tuned thrusters fire to guide the craft in to dock. After about a week's stay, the two astronauts and the Starliner will return to Earth.\n\nWhere will the Starliner land?\n\nThe precise location of the Starliner's landing in the western United States remains undisclosed at this time. During the uncrewed Orbital Test Flight 2 conducted by Boeing on May 25, 2022, the landing took place at White Sands Space Harbor, part of the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range.\n\nThe Starliner is the first orbital capsule to land on solid ground in the U.S., which removes the need for recovery ships. The craft will land using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags. On decent, a pair of drogue chutes are deployed to slow the craft, followed by three main chutes. The heat shield is then ditched and the six airbags are inflated. The airbags serve two purposes, they soften the landing on land and also provide buoyancy and balance for water landings if there is an abort or an emergency reentry.\n\nWhere can I watch the Starliner launch live?\n\nYou can watch as the Starliner Crew Flight Test launches from Florida, docks to the International Space Station and lands in the western U.S. You can even listen to a playlist curated by the teams dedicated to Starliner and the CFT Commercial Crew mission.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

SpaceX has been flying those missions since 2020, and is currently the only company doing so.\n\nToday would mark Boeing's first crewed spaceflight to the ISS.\n\nStarliner has been challenged by delays for years. It's first test flight, an uncrewed launch in 2019, was cut short due to software problems. Other issues were discovered during a 2022 followup.\n\nThe first crewed launch attempt was scrubbed Saturday with a little under 4 minutes left in the countdown. Another attempt Sunday was also called off.\n\nWeather is 90% go, according to the 45th Weather Squadron at Patrick Space Force Base, which issues official launch day forecasts. There is a slight chance that clouds could get in the way.\n\nThousands of people will line area beaches and causeways to watch.\n\n\"Conditions are perfect for launch, and the heat and humidity can only be considered typical for central Florida in early June,\" weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman says. \"Temperatures will be in the mid-80s with dew points in the low 70s, with plenty of sunshine.\"\n\nLiftoff is scheduled for 10:52 a.m. from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, located adjacent to Kennedy Space Center on the Atlantic Coast about an hour east of Orlando.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are now boarding the spacecraft. If all goes as planned, Starliner will dock with the International Space Station, where Wilmore and Williams will spend at least a week before touching back down on Earth.\n\n-How To Watch A Rocket Launch In Person\n\n-The Most Amazing Things We Saw During The 2024 Eclipse\n\n-Your Guide To 2024's Biggest Celestial Events\n\nWeather.com reporter Jan Childs covers breaking news and features related to weather, space, climate change, the environment and everything in between.", "source": {"uri": "weather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Weather Channel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Space_Force_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Space Force Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_Weather_Squadron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "45th Weather Squadron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weather_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Weather Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.w-x.co/Starliner7.4.2024.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA. A pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft. The trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14. Years late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side. Wilmore and Williams - retired Navy captains and former space station residents - stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule. Wednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue. \"I know it's been a long road to get here,\"\u009d NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay. Boeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies. SpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries - Russia, the U.S. and China - had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights. The liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft. Despite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston. Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. If the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip. \"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\"\u009d Fincke told reporters late last week. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The launch, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, marks a significant milestone for Boeing's Starliner program, which aims to provide crew transport to the ISS, competing with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nThe mission, which was previously delayed due to technical issues, is expected to last approximately one week. Wilmore and Williams are set to test Starliner's capabilities, including manual control during the journey to the ISS. They will also conduct tests to evaluate if the spacecraft can serve as a safe haven during emergencies on the ISS.\n\nThe launch was not without its challenges. The previous attempt on Saturday was halted with less than four minutes left in the countdown due to a ground launch computer issue. Another delay occurred on May 6 due to a valve issue on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Boeing and NASA are moving forward with the mission. The Starliner program has faced years of delays and safety concerns but is now on track to demonstrate its capabilities in crewed flight to the ISS.\n\n\"Both Boeing and SpaceX received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop crew capsules following the end of the Space Shuttle program, which left the US reliant on Russian rockets,\" said a NASA spokesperson.\n\nBoeing's Starliner program is part of NASA's efforts to certify multiple commercial crew transport providers to the ISS, reducing reliance on Russian rockets. SpaceX has been fulfilling this role for four years with its Crew Dragon capsule.\n\n\"Boeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture,\" said an industry analyst.\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule, with its distinctive gumdrop shape, is designed to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon. The successful launch of astronauts to the ISS marks a significant step forward for Boeing in the commercial crew transport market.\n\nAs the mission progresses, Boeing and NASA will continue to monitor Starliner's performance. The successful completion of this mission will demonstrate Starliner's capabilities and pave the way for future crewed missions to the ISS and beyond.\n\n(With inputs from Agencies)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110742937,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-190398,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1444, "textEnd": 1449}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

If the launch is successful, Starliner will dock to the forward-facing port of the space station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15pm on June 6, 2024.\n\nNASA's first launch attempt was aborted just two hours before scheduled liftoff to allow teams to analyze a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank of the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage. The team later replaced the valve before attempting another launch. The valve in question is used to maintain the proper pressure inside the Centaur stage's liquid oxygen tank.\n\nThe second launch attempt got called off with just under four minutes until launch. This time around, the mission was scrubbed because of an automatic hold of the ground launch sequencer. The team completed work on the launch pad on June 2 to change out and test a failed power distribution source that halted the launch attempt.\n\nAccording to NASA, once astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams reach ISS, they will remain there for about a week to test the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems before NASA works to complete final certification of the transportation system for rotational mission to the orbiting laboratory as part of the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nLive coverage of today's launch attempt can be viewed via the live feed from NASA above, or via NASA's website.", "source": {"uri": "hothardware.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotHardware"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_sweezy@hothardware.com", "name": "Tim Sweezy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64717/content/hero-boeing-starliner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 1296, "textEnd": 1302}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Upcoming SpaceX, NASA, ULA rocket launch schedule in Florida\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a post-launch press release.\n\n\"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task -- but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration,\" Nelson said.\n\nWilmore and Williams plan to spend about a week aboard the orbiting outpost, then return to New Mexico via parachutes inside America's newest crewed spacecraft.\n\nThe two astronauts will assess an array of attributes aboard Starliner, including performance of crew equipment, suits and seats, spacecraft thrusters for manual abort scenarios, communication checkouts, manual and automated navigation, and life support systems, ULA reported.\n\n\"The principal provider of humans and logistics would be SpaceX at this point. Soyuz and Progress (Russia's expendable cargo spacecraft) are still active. But having a set of redundancy within the United States, I would consider almost mandatory,\" said retired NASA astronaut Fred Gregory, who logged more than 455 hours in space on three shuttle missions (STS-51B in 1985, STS-33 in 1989 and STS-44 in 1991).\n\nGregory -- who served as NASA Deputy Administrator from 2002 to 2005 -- said \"redundancy is always highest priority\" in terms of space travel and potential failure. He said he relates with Wilmore and Williams on a professional level, though he was working in Washington, D.C., when they were first selected as astronauts.\n\n\"Suni, as an example, was a helicopter pilot who went through tests while in school. I did the same thing. I went to the Naval Test Pilot School as a helicopter pilot,\" Gregory said.\n\n\"But I also did fixed-wing -- and Butch did that at the Navy Test Pilot School. So even though I may not know them personally, I know what they went through, the experiences they had, and the preparation for this,\" he said.\n\n\"And I certainly consider them most highly qualified to do this,\" he said.\n\nWednesday's groundbreaking mission marked the 100th flight of an Atlas V, ULA officials reported.\n\n\"The names of Wilmore and Williams now join Glenn, Carpenter, Schirra and Cooper as American astronauts to launch into space atop Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral,\" a ULA blog post said.\n\nThe capsule is carrying about 759 pounds of cargo, including food, clothing, exercise gear, medical supplies, photo and media equipment, vehicle supplies and tools, NASA Commercial Crew officials reported.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" program manager Steve Stich said in a post-launch press release.\n\n\"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight,\" Stich said.\n\nPrior to Wednesday's launch, Starliner flew two uncrewed orbital flights -- including a test to and from the ISS -- along with a pad abort demonstration, NASA reported.\n\nFor the latest news and launch schedule from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center, visit floridatoday.com/space.\n\nRick Neale is a Space Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

Since May the most recent scrub was minutes before the astronauts, who were strapped in, were scheduled to take off on Saturday.\n\nNASA and its mission partners scrubbed the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test launch attempt on Saturday, June 1, due to an observation of a ground launch sequencer. The system was unsuccessful in verifying the sequencer's necessary redundancy. The team is evaluating the upcoming launch opportunities on Sunday, June 2; Wednesday, June 5; and Thursday, June 6.

The first Starliner flight with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, known as NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, is targeted to liftoff at 10:52 a.m. EDT Wednesday, June 5, to the International Space Station for about a one week stay aboard the microgravity laboratory.\n\nWork at the launch pad at Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida was completed June 2 to change out and test a failed power distribution source that halted a launch attempt on June 1. The Starliner mission management team reviewed multiple aspects of the replacement and troubleshooting steps and polled \"go\" to proceed during a detailed session as they continue to prep the teams and hardware for the June 5 opportunity.\n\n\"I really appreciate all the work by the NASA, Boeing, and ULA teams over the last week,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. \"In particular, the ULA team worked really hard to quickly learn more about these issues, keep our NASA and Boeing teams informed, and protect for this next attempt. We will continue to take it one step at a time.\"\n\nThe weather forecast continues to call for favorable conditions, with Boeing meteorologists from the 45th Weather Squadron predicting a 90% chance of acceptable conditions at launch time. The ascent corridor and onshore winds weather also is forecast to be acceptable in the unlikely case of an emergency abort during the launch.\n\nWilmore and Williams continue preparing for launch with proficiency training. The two remain quarantined at Kennedy Space Center in Florida ahead of liftoff.\n\nNASA, mission partners target June 5 Crew Flight Test launch\n\nNASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test mission teams are preparing to support a launch at 10:52 a.m. EDT Wednesday, June 5, from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on a mission of about a week to the International Space Station.\n\nTechnicians and engineers with ULA (United Launch Alliance) worked overnight and on Sunday to assess the ground support equipment at the launch pad that encountered issues during the countdown and scrubbed the June 1 launch attempt. The ULA team identified an issue with a single ground power supply within one of the three redundant chassis that provides power to a subset of computer cards controlling various system functions, including the card responsible for the stable replenishment topping valves for the Centaur upper stage. All three of these chassis are required to enter the terminal phase of the launch countdown to ensure crew safety.\n\nOn Sunday, the chassis containing the faulty ground power unit was removed, visually inspected, and replaced with a spare chassis. No signs of physical damage were observed. A full failure analysis of the power unit will be performed to better understand root cause. Meanwhile, ULA has completed functional checkouts of the new chassis and the cards, and all hardware is performing normally.\n\nThe mission managers have opted for the next launch attempt on June 5. The U.S. Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron predicts a 90% chance of favorable weather conditions, with the cumulus cloud rule being the primary weather concern.

The system was unsuccessful in verifying the sequencer's necessary redundancy. The team is evaluating the upcoming launch opportunities on Sunday, June 2; Wednesday, June 5; and Thursday, June 6. NASA will update the launch coverage advisory timing as soon as possible.\n\nNASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) scrubbed today's launch opportunity due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count. The ULA team is working to understand the cause. The next launch opportunity is Sunday, June 2, at 12:03 p.m. EDT for launch of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test.\n\nThe ULA Atlas V rocket and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft are in a safe configuration, and NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are preparing to exit the spacecraft.\n\nULA just issued : \"Everything continues to progress towards the ULA Atlas V launch carrying the first crewed Boeing Starliner spacecraft for NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP).

(NASA photo)\n\nFollowing is a report from Boeing:\n\nNASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) teams continue working remaining open tasks in preparation for the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than 4:43 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing.\n\nOn May 11, the ULA team successfully replaced a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage. The team also performed re-pressurization and system purges, and tested the new valve, which performed normally.\n\nStarliner teams are working to resolve a small helium leak detected in the spacecraft's service module traced to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster. Helium is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire and is not combustible or toxic.\n\nNASA and Boeing are developing spacecraft testing and operational solutions to address the issue. As a part of the testing, Boeing will bring the propulsion system up to flight pressurization just as it does prior to launch, and then allow the helium system to vent naturally to validate existing data and strengthen flight rationale. Mission teams also completed a thorough review of the data from the May 6 launch attempt and are not tracking any other issues.\n\nThe Atlas V and Starliner remain in the Vertical Integration Facility at Space Launch Complex-41 on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, still in preflight quarantine, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend extra time with their families as prelaunch operations progress. The duo will fly back to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the coming days.\n\nULA's Boeing Starliner launch for NASA astronauts delayed again adding to the $1.5 billion over budget\n\nAn Atlas V N22 rocket will launch Boeing's Starliner on CFT. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nStarliner's mission carrying two NASA astronauts had been scheduled for liftoff from Florida last week until a technical issue with its Atlas 5 rocket prompted a delay to Friday, May 17. The launch of Starliner is now set for no earlier than 4:43 p.m. Tuesday, May 21 at 4:43 p.m. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, reportedly returned to Houston to be with their families and now plan to return to Florida in the coming days\n\nThis hitch in the latest postponement only compounds the expense for a program years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nBoeing stated that a small helium leak was detected in the spacecraft's service module that is the disposable module that sits below the spacecraft and contains the thrusters and launch abort engines.\n\nThe helium leak was found to be coming from a \"flange on a single reaction control system thruster.\" While helium is not reactive, it is used within thrusters to assist in firing. In order to ensure the safety of the spacecraft, the Boeing team states they plan to fully investigate the leak and that means bringing Starliner's propulsion system to the state seen before launch.\n\nBoeing added that they aren't currently tracking any other issues with the spacecraft.\n\nOriginally set for May 6, the launch was scrubbed when a faulty oxygen valve on the Atlas V was discovered with almost two hours left until launch. The crew was in the process of getting in the spacecraft when teams called off the launch to investigate the valve.\n\n\"And every now and again, in rare occasions, a valve like that can get into a position where it's just off the seat. Its temperature, its stiffness, everything is just right. And it'll flutter. Or it'll buzz -- in this case -- in cycle,\" ULA President Tory Bruno said during a press conference which followed the May 6 night scrub.\n\n\"We've seen that before,\" said Bruno. \"What you would typically do is activate the solenoid that forces the valve closed -- cycling the valve, if you will -- then you turn that on and let it return.\"\n\nNASA's statement regarding the scrub indicated that the two astronauts flying the CFT mission, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain at the Kennedy Space Center in pre-flight quarantine for this latest delay.\n\nThe delay enables United Launch Alliance to return the rocket to its Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) hangar near the pad to replace a liquid oxygen pressure regulation valve in the Centaur. That valve started oscillating after the stage was loaded with liquid oxygen, creating a buzzing noise noticed by launch pad crews.\n\nIn NASA's statement about the new delay, the agency said that while the valve vibration was dampened once the valve was closed after the scrub, that vibration returned twice while propellant was being offloaded from the rocket.\n\n\"After evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve,\" NASA stated.\n\nAt a briefing after the May 6 scrub, Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said the concern was that the vibration could have caused the valve to approach its rated life of 200,000 cycles. The valve was vibrating at 40 hertz, he noted.\n\nBruno continued that engineers would examine if those vibrations involved full cycles of the valve, and ULA would have to replace the valve. However, if the valve was only partially moving, then it was possible the valve was not nearing its design life and could be retained. Officials said at the briefing that they could try to launch again the next day, but later revised the launch date to the next opportunity, May 10, before this latest delay.\n\nNASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test now is targeted to launch no earlier than 6:16 p.m. EDT Friday, May 17, to the International Space Station. Following a thorough data review completed on Tuesday, United Launch Alliance decided to remove and replace a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage.\n\nULA plans to roll the rocket, with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, back to its Vertical Integration Facility on Wednesday, May 8, to begin the replacement. The ULA team will perform leak checks and functional checkouts in support of the next launch attempt.\n\nThe oscillating behavior of the valve during prelaunch operations ultimately resulted in mission teams calling a launch scrub on May 6. After the ground and flight crew safely egressed from Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) last night, the ULA team successfully commanded the valve closed and the oscillations were temporarily dampened. The oscillations then re-occurred twice during fuel removal operations. After evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve.\n\nMission managers discussed the details leading to the decision to scrub the May 6 launch opportunity during a news conference shortly after the call at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will remain at crew quarters in health stabilization until the next launch opportunity. The duo will be the first to launch aboard Starliner to the space station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew, we scrubbed the Crew Flight Test (CFT) launch attempt today due to an observation on a liquid oxygen self-regulating solenoid relief valve on the Centaur upper stage. The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment, so we are targeting the next launch attempt no earlier than Friday, May 10.\n\nPilot ingress.

Boeing launched an orbital test flight without astronauts twice because of a botched first attempt in 2019 that failed to reach the ISS. They were also set to launch Williams and Wilmore last summer, but Boeing managers revealed new issues with the spacecraft after further examining data from Starliner's OFT orbital flight test in May 2022.\n\nThe launch was halted due to an issue that cropped up with a valve on the spacecraft's rocket two hours before launch. Mission controllers declared a launch \"scrub\" after an anomaly was detected on an oxygen valve on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket\n\nA new launch date has not yet been announced.\n\nThe official crew portrait celebrates the astronauts of the CFT mission.

The mission is planned to lift off on Monday, May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The launch is planned for 10:34 p.m. EDT. Today's forecast shows a 95 percent chance of favorable weather conditions for launch.\n\nLaunch Forecast Summary:\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints: 5%\n\nPrimary concerns: Cumulus Cloud Rule\n\nOverall probability of violating weather constraints for 24-hour delay: 5%\n\nThe names of Wilmore and Williams will soon join Glenn, Carpenter, Schirra and Cooper as pioneering astronauts to launch atop Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe first four Americans to orbit the Earth during NASA's Project Mercury all rode early Atlas boosters to place their single-seat capsules into space. Now 60 years later, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will launch astronauts using the latest generation of Atlas V rockets for NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 1962, the Atlas 109-D rocket launched John Glenn, the first American ever to circle the planet in space, and his Friendship 7 capsule. His three orbits made Glenn a national hero.\n\nThe Atlas 107-D rocket launched Scott Carpenter and Aurora 7 on May 24, 1962, to orbit the Earth three times. Sigma 7 and Walter Schirra were launched by Atlas 113-D on Oct. 3, 1962, to complete six orbits. And Atlas 130-D launched Faith 7 and Gordon Cooper on May 15, 1963 for a 34-hour voyage in orbit, completing the Mercury missions.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be the first crew members to fly aboard Starliner on its Crew Flight Test (CFT). Wilmore and Williams, both Naval aviators, military test pilots and former commanders of the International Space Station, have worked closely with Boeing to develop the Starliner spacecraft and ULA on the features required to carry crew.\n\nAtlas V will launch Starliner on its journey to rendezvous and dock with the space station, where the two astronauts will live and work for about a week before undocking and returning to Earth to land at a site in the Western U.S.\n\nWilmore, commander of the CFT mission, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights to the space station. Wilmore is from Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, and earned degrees from Tennessee Technological University in electrical engineering and the University of Tennessee in aviation systems. He is married with two daughters.\n\nWilmore has accumulated more than 8,000 flight hours and 663 carrier landings, all in tactical jet aircraft, and is a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School. During his tenure as a fleet Naval officer and aviator, Wilmore completed four operational deployments, flying the A-7E and F/A 18 aircraft from the decks of the USS Forrestal, USS Kennedy, USS Enterprise and the USS Eisenhower aircraft carriers.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in July 2000, Wilmore was assigned technical duties representing the Astronaut Office on all propulsion systems, including the space shuttle main engines, solid rocket motors and external tank, and also led the astronaut support team that traveled to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida, in support of launch and landing operations. To date Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nHe completed his first flight as pilot of space shuttle Atlantis on STS-129, logging 11 days in space in November 2009. This was the 31st shuttle flight to the station. During the mission, the crew delivered two Express Logistics Carrier racks and about 30,000 pounds of replacement parts to maintain the station's proper orientation in space.\n\nWilmore's second flight was as a long-duration resident aboard the station. From September to November 2014, he served as flight engineer for Expedition 41 and then as commander of Expedition 42 from November 2014 to March 2015 totaling nearly six months in space. Wilmore performed three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. In addition, he completed a spacewalk to replace a failed voltage regulator. Wilmore and two Roscosmos cosmonauts launched to the space station in a Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and returned to Earth safely to touch down in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan after the 167-day mission.\n\nWilliams, pilot of the CFT mission, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights as a long-duration resident aboard the space station. Williams is from Needham, Massachusetts, and earned a physical science degree from the U.S. Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology. She is married and is a dog mom.\n\nWilliams has accumulated 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft. She received her designation as a Basic Diving Officer and later was designated a Naval Aviator. Williams was selected for United States Naval Test Pilot School, and after graduation she was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer. She went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an Instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and the school's Safety Officer.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on 7 spacewalks. Williams worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew. After her first flight, she served as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office. She then performed another long-duration mission that included serving as station commander.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 from December 2006 to June 2007, launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the station. While onboard, Williams established a world record for females at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight.\n\nWilliams launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Soyuz with a Roscosmos cosmonaut and Japanese astronaut for Expedition 32/33 from July to November 2012. Williams spent 127 days in space conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory. She performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repaired an ammonia leak on a station radiator.\n\nULA's L-2 report states that everything continues to progress towards the ULA Atlas V launch carrying the first crewed Boeing Starliner spacecraft for NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP).\n\nThe mission is planned to lift off on Monday, May 6 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

A live countdown blog and launch webcast in collaboration with Boeing and NASA will be available on the ULA website.\n\nThe Atlas V launch countdown begins 11 hours and 20 minutes before liftoff and features a four-hour planned, built-in hold at the T-minus four-minute mark for crew ingress into Starliner.\n\nThe CFT astronauts will board Starliner after Atlas V is readied. Photo by NASA\n\nOverseeing the start of the countdown is the \"Preps Team\" of console operators inside the Advanced Spaceflight Operations Center. Launch Conductor Dillon Rice will orchestrate the countdown procedures from the Launch Control Center while ULA Launch Director James Whelan is at the helm in the Mission Director's Center.\n\nThis initial phase of the count will be spent powering up the rocket, running system checkouts, completing standard pre-launch testing and performing final preparations on the rocket and pad systems for propellant-loading operations.\n\nThe Preps Team will lead the countdown through its first five hours, then a shift change occurs to hand each station to the \"Tanking & Launch Team\" of console operators. These counterparts take responsibilities for the next six hours through liftoff, led by ULA Chief Launch Conductor Doug Lebo and ULA Launch Director Tom Heter.\n\nThe shift handover happens during the planned, hour-long countdown hold at T-minus two hours. Just before the hold concludes, readiness polls are conducted to authorize the start of cryogenic tanking. With the pad cleared of all personnel, the hazardous operation of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen filling the Atlas V rocket's stages for launch is performed.\n\nOnce fueling is completed and the rocket's tanks placed into stable replenishment, the countdown enters the extended hold at T-minus four minutes. The Blue Team is dispatched to the pad's 200-foot-tall (61-m) Crew Access Tower (CAT) to ready the White Room and Starliner crew module for arrival of the astronauts, assist the crew into their seats and then close the hatch for flight.\n\nThe team is comprised of eight specialists from ULA and Boeing. Dane Drefke, ULA's mechanical operations lead engineer serves as the Blue Team Leader (BTL). He is in charge of the Blue Team's activities and has an obligation to ensure everyone's safety.\n\nULA's three representatives on the Blue Team begin activities by walking across the 48-foot-long (14.6-m) retractable catwalk extending from the CAT to the White Room. Their duties include verifying the White Room is safe for personnel to enter, establishing access to the capsule, deploying the environmental seal between the pad and spacecraft and setting up access platforms.\n\nThe ULA members then switch places with five Boeing technicians, waiting in the wings on the CAT, led by Boeing's Pad Team Leader Nate Keyek-Franssen for assisting the crew into the spacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts, commander Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams, receive a final weather briefing and don their spacesuits before leaving NASA's Crew Quarters in the Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building at the Kennedy Space Center. Departure to board Boeing's Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV) occurs about three hours and 20 minutes before launch.\n\nThe trip to SLC-41 will take about 25 minutes, with the CTV arriving at the base of the CAT approximately two hours and 55 minutes before launch. The astronauts will take the elevator to Level 12 while the CTV convoy departs the pad and heads to the safe fallback area.\n\nOnce crew ingress is completed, another weather briefing will be held 90 minutes before launch, to inform mission managers that conditions are suitable for the Blue Team to close the Starliner hatch and proceed with the countdown. Pending a go, Boeing technicians will close the hatch and perform cabin leak checks to verify the integrity of the seal.\n\nThe Crew Access Arm enables the astronauts to board the spacecraft. Photo by United Launch\n\nAllianceBoeing personnel then depart the White Room so that the ULA technicians can retract access platforms and deflate the environmental seal around the spacecraft to prepare the Crew Access Arm for rotation to the launch position later in the countdown. The entire Blue Team departs the pad about 35 minutes before liftoff.\n\nThe access arm will be hydraulically swung away from the spacecraft 11 minutes prior to launch. The process will take about two minutes to reach the stowed position against the CAT. If the need arises, the arm can be redeployed in less than 15 seconds by dropping counterweights.\n\nSeven minutes before launch, Lebo performs the readiness polling of the launch team members, Ascent Flight Director Mike Lammers in Houston and the Starliner crew before Heter gives final permission to launch. The countdown clocks resume four minutes before liftoff to put the rocket on internal power, pressurize its tanks, arm systems and start the main engine.\n\nThe daily available launch window is instantaneous, meaning there is only an instant in time each day for launch to occur. This split second happens when the orbital plane of the International Space Station passes over the launch pad, thereby enabling Atlas V to put Starliner on the proper trajectory to intercept the station for rendezvous and docking.\n\nThe main engine and twin solid rocket boosters generate 1.6 million pounds (7.1 mega-Newtons) of thrust to begin the voyage of Wilmore and Williams. The commander will call out \"roll program\" as Atlas V clears the tower to place the astronauts heads-up for their ride to space.\n\nThe main engine will ease back for a period of deep throttling, going into its throttle bucket during the region of maximum aerodynamic stresses on the rocket in the dense lower atmosphere and to lessen the G-loads on the crew.\n\nThe solid rocket boosters burn for a minute-and-a-half, followed by the main engine revving back to full throttle, to triple the rocket's velocity through the remaining first stage of flight.\n\nJust over two minutes after liftoff, Atlas V will have burned nearly 500,000 pounds (227,000 kg) of fuel and weigh only half of what it did at launch.\n\nAn illustration depicts Atlas V stagging during the launch of Starliner.\n\nFollowing the first stage engine shutdown, the Atlas V common core booster will jettison from the Centaur four minutes and 35 seconds after liftoff. The Centaur ignites both engines 10 seconds later at an altitude of approximately 60 nautical miles (111 km).\n\nThe Centaur burn will last just over seven minutes to deliver Starliner at the desired injection point for separation at T+plus 14 minutes, 55 seconds into a 98 by 39-nautical mile (181\u00d772-km) suborbital trajectory, inclined 51.6 degrees relative to the equator.\n\nAtlas V will launch northeasterly from Cape Canaveral, paralleling the Eastern Seaboard and crossing the North Atlantic to accelerate Starliner to 17,475 mph (28,123 kmph).\n\nFor Starliner missions, Atlas V takes a special trajectory to space that requires the Centaur upper stage to use two engines instead of one. The double-engine configuration allows the rocket to fly a flatter trajectory and ensure the spacecraft can execute an abort at any time to bring the astronauts back to Earth safely if a problem occurs.\n\nDual Engine Centaur also enables the customized flight profile for Starliner that features just a single burn and a limited acceleration rate to manage the G-force experienced by the astronauts aboard.\n\nAfter Centaur releases Starliner, the spacecraft employs the same operational procedure as the space shuttle, which also launched on suborbital trajectories, by performing an orbital-maneuvering engine firing to reach a stable orbit about 15 minutes after separation.\n\nULA's Starliner in countdown mode and Status Check for first human launch of NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams to ISS\n\nAtlas V will launch Boeing's Starliner with two NASA astronauts on the Crew Flight Test mission.

Wilmore, the CFT commander, is a retired U.S. Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights to the space station. Williams, serving as the CFT pilot, is also a retired Navy captain and veteran of two previous spaceflights as a long-duration resident aboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nStarliner arrives at the VIF. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nThis morning, Starliner traveled from Boeing's Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to ULA's Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) for connection to the Atlas V.\n\nULA's motorized payload transporter, adapted to carry Starliner, moved at a top speed of 5 mph, heading from the C3PF, a former space shuttle hangar, eastward to the beach and then southward to the launch site. The transporter deck also provided Starliner with environmental controls to keep its compartments in good health during the transport.\n\nApproaching the VIF, the transporter maneuvered up to the 30-story-tall building's doorway and parked. A four-point lifting sling, called the Handling Fixture Hoist Tool, was connected to the Starliner, for the overhead crane to carefully raise the spacecraft onto the Atlas V waiting inside the VIF aboard its Mobile Launch Platform (MLP).\n\nStarliner was positioned for mating to the Launch Vehicle Adapter (LVA) that serves as the spacecraft's cradle on the rocket during ascent. The LVA also features the aeroskirt structure that smooths the air over the combined payload and Atlas V for aerodynamic stability.\n\nNext up is the integrated systems test, a tip-to-tail electrical check of the 172-foot-tall (52-meter) Atlas V and Starliner stack.\n\nAtlas V and Starliner stand ready for CFT. Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nThe MLP will move the rocket and spacecraft to the pad approximately two days prior to liftoff for final sequence of activities that include testing, fueling, boarding of the astronaut crew and launch.\n\nStarliner is a next-generation, autonomous spacecraft for safe and reliable crew and cargo transportation to and from low-Earth orbit destinations. For NASA missions to the orbiting laboratory, Starliner will carry up to four NASA-sponsored crew members and about 220 pounds of time-critical scientific research.\n\nCFT will reuse the Starliner crew module that flew the first OFT mission, named Calypso by Williams.\n\nFollowing a successful CFT mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying the Starliner spacecraft and systems for crew missions to the space station. Long-duration commercial crew rotation missions enable NASA to continue the important research and technology investigations taking place aboard the orbiting laboratory. Such research benefits people on Earth and lays the groundwork for future space exploration.\n\nUpdate to ULA's Starliner's first human launch of NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams to ISS\n\nLaunch Vehicle on Stand: Atlas V Starliner Crew Flight Test\n\nThe United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V booster arrives at the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) adjacent to Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

Photo by United Launch Alliance\n\nDaily routines and dress rehearsals keep everyone busy in preparation for the first launch of humans in an ULA Atlas V rocket to the ISS. Here's a peek at some of the proceedings that are taking place in beautiful Florida and the weather is picture perfect.\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch on May 6, 2024 at 10:34 p.m. EDT Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita (Suni) Williams on the Crew Flight Test (CFT).\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch on May 6, 2024 at 10:34 p.m. EDT Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita (Suni) Williams on the Crew Flight Test (CFT).\n\nFollowing separation from Atlas V, Starliner engines will burn taking it the rest of the way to orbit and on to the International Space Station. CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Go Atlas! Go Centaur! Go Starliner!\n\nA United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket will launch Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft with two NASA astronauts on the Crew Flight Test (CFT). Following separation from Atlas V, Starliner engines will burn taking it the rest of the way to orbit and on to the International Space Station. CFT is ULA's first human launch. Liftoff will occur from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.\n\nCFT is the final test to demonstrate the full end-of-end capabilities of the Starliner system to deliver crews to and from the space station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The unique Atlas configuration for Starliner includes a dual-engine Centaur upper stage to deliver the performance needed to shape the trajectory for crew safety; a launch vehicle adapter that structurally attaches the Starliner to the Atlas V rocket for ascent; a 70-inch-long (1.8-m) aeroskirt to enhance the aerodynamic characteristics, stability and loads of the Atlas V; and an Emergency Detection System that provides an extra layer of safety for astronauts riding the reliable Atlas V. The Atlas V Starliner launch countdown features a four-hour planned, built-in hold at the T-minus 4-minute mark. This allows the rocket to be fueled and placed in a quiescent state before boarding of the astronauts into the spacecraft.\n\nCFT bridges the history of Atlas with today's rocket. The first orbital spaceflights of American astronauts in the 1960s were launched in Project Mercury by Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral. That legacy continues with Atlas V launching crews from U.S. soil.\n\nModified specifically for the Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, the Atlas V Starliner configuration does not include a payload fairing. Instead, the Starliner's insulated surfaces take the place of the fairing to protect the uncrewed spacecraft during ascent. The vehicle's height with the Boeing CST-100 Starliner is approximately 172 ft (52.4 meters).\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner is attached to the Atlas V using a launch vehicle adapter (LVA), which also includes an aeroskirt to reduce the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. The aeroskirt is jettisoned for improved performance following booster stage separation.\n\nThe Centaur second stage is 10 ft (3 meters) in diameter and 41.5 ft (12.6 meters) in length. Its propellant tanks are pressure-stabilized and constructed of corrosion-resistant stainless steel. Centaur is a cryogenic vehicle, fueled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Atlas V configuration for this mission is powered by dual RL10A-4-2 engines, each producing 22,600 lbs (100.5 kilo-Newtons) of thrust. The cryogenic tanks are insulated with a combination of helium-purged blankets, radiation shields and spray-on foam insulation (SOFI). The Centaur forward adapter (CFA) provides structural mountings for the fault-tolerant avionics system and electrical interfaces with the spacecraft. The Centaur also includes an Emergency Detection System (EDS) that monitors for critical hazards to detect an imminent or occurring failure. The EDS also provides critical in-flight data which supports jettison of the ascent cover and initiates CST-100 Starliner spacecraft separation.\n\nThe booster is 12.5 ft (3.81 meters) in diameter and 106.5 ft (32.4 meters) in length. The booster's tanks are structurally rigid and constructed of isogrid aluminum barrels, spun-formed aluminum domes and intertank skirts. Booster propulsion is provided by the RD-180 engine system (a single engine with two thrust chambers). The RD-180 burns RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly purified kerosene) and liquid oxygen and delivers 860,200 lbs (3.83 mega-Newtons) of thrust at sea level. Two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) generate the additional power required at liftoff, with each SRB providing 348,500 lbs (1.55 mega-Newtons) of thrust. The Centaur avionics system provides guidance, flight control and vehicle sequencing functions during the booster and Centaur phases of flight.\n\nSpace Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41), the East Coast home of the Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, employs a \"clean pad\" concept of operations to ready launch vehicles and payloads for ascent into space. The rocket elements are assembled atop a Mobile Launch Platform inside the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) located adjacent to the launch pad. The platform and fully stacked Atlas V then travel by rail approximately 1,800 feet northward from the VIF to the pad for the final countdown, fueling and liftoff. Complex 41 was constructed by the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s for the Titan rocket program. The site was rejuvenated in support of the Atlas V starting in the late 1990s.", "source": {"uri": "news.satnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.satnews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP) -- Boeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nBoeing's Starliner mission will make a third attempt at launching its first crewed flight test Wednesday in a milestone that has been a decade in the making.\n\nThe new spacecraft's maiden voyage with humans on board is on track to lift off atop an Atlas V rocket at 10:52 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe historic event will stream live on NASA's website, with coverage beginning at 6:45 a.m. ET.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are set to ride aboard the Starliner capsule on a journey that takes them to the International Space Station.\n\nWeather conditions are 90% favorable for a Wednesday morning launch, with the only concern being cumulus clouds, according to the US Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron. If liftoff does not occur on Wednesday, there is another opportunity at 10:29 a.m. ET Thursday, according to NASA.\n\nThe mission, known as the Crew Flight Test, is the culmination of Boeing's efforts to develop a spacecraft to rival SpaceX's prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand the United States' options for ferrying astronauts to the space station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The federal agency's initiative aims to foster collaboration with private industry partners.\n\nIf successful, the flight would mark only the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a May news conference.\n\n\"It started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX's) Dragon -- and now Starliner,\" Nelson said.\n\nWilliams will also make history as the first woman to fly aboard such a mission.\n\nHistoric flight has lofty goals\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore (left) and Suni Williams have been in quarantine to protect their health since the end of April.\n\nCory S Huston/NASA\n\nIf Starliner successfully lifts off, the astronauts will spend just over 24 hours traveling to the space station.\n\nAfter docking around 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday, Williams and Wilmore are set to spend eight days living in the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board.\n\nAboard Starliner is a crucial pump needed to fix the space station's urine processor assembly, which failed on May 29.\n\n\"That urine processor takes all of the crew's urine and processes it in the first step of a water recovery system,\" said Dana Weigel, manager for NASA's International Space Station Program. \"It then sends it downstream to a water processor which turns it into drinking water. The station's really designed to be a closed loop.\"\n\nNow, the urine has to be stored onboard in containers, so Starliner's anticipated arrival to the space station can't come soon enough.\n\nThe astronauts will test various aspects of Starliner's capabilities, including the spacecraft's thruster performance, how their spacesuits function within the capsule, and manual piloting in case the crew needs to override the spacecraft's autopilot.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will also test Starliner's \"safe haven\" capability, designed to offer the space station crew a shelter if there is a problem, according to Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, during a May 31 news conference.\n\nWhen it's time to head home, the astronauts will return using the same Starliner capsule and parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.\n\nYears of development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner's path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing's competitor under NASA's Commercial Crew program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.\n\nThis mission could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing's Starliner spacecraft ready for routine operations to deliver astronauts and cargo to the space station.\n\nWeeks of troubleshooting\n\nA number of issues caused the previous crewed launch attempts, on May 6 and June 1, to be scrubbed.\n\nTwo hours prior to the launch attempt on May 6, engineers identified an issue with a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket, which was built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The entire stack, including the rocket and spacecraft, was rolled back from the launchpad for testing and repairs.\n\nTeams also worked through a small helium leak within the spacecraft service module, a \"design vulnerability\" in the propulsion system and assessed the parachutes for the Starliner capsule.\n\nStarliner was just 3 minutes and 50 seconds from liftoff Saturday afternoon, when an automatic hold was triggered by the ground launch sequencer, or the computer that launches the rocket.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance technicians and engineers assessed the ground support equipment over the weekend, examining three large computers housed inside a shelter at the base of the launchpad. Each computer is the same, providing triple redundancy to ensure the safe launch of crewed missions.\n\n\"Imagine a large rack that is a big computer where the functions of the computer as a controller are broken up separately into individual cards or printed wire circuit boards,\" said Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United Launch Alliance, during a Saturday news conference. \"They're all stand-alone, but together, it's an integrated controller.\"\n\nThe cards within the computers are responsible for different key systems that must occur before a launch, such as releasing bolts at the rocket's base so it can lift off after ignition.\n\nDuring the final four minutes before launch, all three computers must communicate and agree with one another. But during Saturday's countdown, a card on one of the computers was six seconds slower in responding than the other two computers, indicating that something was not correct and triggering an automatic hold, according to Bruno.\n\nOver the weekend, engineers evaluated the computers, their power supply and network communications between the computers. The team isolated the issue to a single ground power supply within one of the computers, which provides power to the computer cards responsible for key countdown events -- including the replenishment valves for the rocket's upper stage, which also caused an issue during the countdown, according to an update shared by NASA.\n\nStarliner teams reported no signs of physical damage to the computer, which they removed and replaced with a spare. The other computers and their cards were also assessed, and all of them are performing normally as expected, according to the ULA team.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The launch that marks Sunita's third foray into space is the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history.\n\nAlso Read | Sunita Williams Flies to Space: Indian-Origin NASA Astronaut Scripts History by Flying Aboard Boeing Starliner, Videos Surface.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying the Boeing Starliner's 'Calypso' capsule lifted off from the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida, NASA said today.\n\nThe aerospace giant's mission was hit by multiple delays previously. Williams and Wilmore are now expected to spend more than 24 hours traveling to the International Space Station, and dock with it at 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nAlso Read | US President Joe Biden Congratulates Prime Minister Narendra Modi, NDA on Win in 2024 Lok Sabha Elections.\n\nA previous attempt to launch the mission dubbed the Crew Flight Test was cancelled on Saturday, less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nThe launch is part of NASA's \"commercial crew programme\", which selected Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in the year 2011.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nWhile the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX company's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS since its first launch on May 30, 2020,\n\nBoeing's Starliner has been faced with multiple setbacks. Meanwhile the Starliner capsule will dock with the ISS and the astronauts will be at the ISS conducting a range of tests for about a week. Starliner will then undock from the ISS re-enter Earth's atmosphere and make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10, NASA said.\n\nSunita has traveled to space twice before, once on a NASA space shuttle in 2006 and then on a Russian Soyuz capsule in 2012 in an earlier. She's logged 322 total days in space.\n\nNASA selected Boeing and SpaceX in September 2014 to transport crew to the International Space Station from the United States. These integrated spacecraft, rockets and associated systems will carry up to four astronauts on NASA missions, maintaining a space station crew of seven to maximize time dedicated to scientific research on the orbiting laboratory.\n\nSunita and Barry Wilmore were both former commanders of the International Space Station.\n\nSunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nShe worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nBoeing has planned six manned missions for the platform over the next six years, the projected end of the ISS' operating lifespan.

Countdown is on for another try to launch Boeing's Starliner", "body": "For the third time in a month, two NASA astronauts have taken their seats for an attempt to launch the first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket is due to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 10:52 a.m. ET (7:52 a.m. PT) today, sending Starliner and its crew -- NASA's Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams -- on a shakedown cruise to the International Space Station and back.\n\nNASA is streaming live coverage of the countdown.\n\nBoeing's effort to get Starliner ready to carry astronauts has suffered through years of delays and roughly $1.5 billion in cost overruns. But the two earlier attempts to launch this Crew Flight Test, or CFT, were due to problems with the Atlas V launch system rather than with Starliner.\n\nThe first attempt was called off on May 6, two hours before liftoff, due to concerns about a valve on the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage. The second try was scrubbed on June 1, with less than four minutes left in the countdown, when an alarm was triggered due to a faulty power supply in one of the launch control computers.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance's team replaced the hardware and verified that the system was \"good to go,\" in the words of the company's CEO, Tory Bruno. ULA, Boeing and NASA then gave the go-ahead for today's countdown.\n\n\"As you might imagine, there's lots of pressure to just go,\" Bruno said in a posting to the X social-media platform. \"But that's not what we're here for.\"\n\nThe gumdrop-shaped Starliner spacecraft has been through two uncrewed flight tests -- an initial test that fell short of full success in 2019, and a do-over that reached the space station and met its objectives in 2022. This will be the first time Starliner has carried actual astronauts rather than test dummies.\n\nCFT's main objective is to have the crew verify that all of Starliner's systems work as expected. They'll run through tests during the daylong cruise to the International Space Station, and during what's envisioned as an eight-day stay aboard the station. Wilmore and Williams will deliver about 760 pounds of supplies and equipment, including a replacement pump for the station's urine-recycling system.\n\nAt the end of their orbital stay, Wilmore and Williams will climb back into their reusable Starliner capsule -- which has been christened Calypso, in honor of the ship used by the late ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Then they'll descend to a parachute-aided, airbag-cushioned touchdown in the western U.S., with the precise landing site to be determined by the timing of their departure.\n\nWhen CFT is finished, NASA and its partners will evaluate Starliner's performance and make adjustments in the design or procedures as necessary. In the months ahead, NASA is aiming to have Starliner certified so that it can take its place alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon as a commercial \"space taxi\" for ferrying astronauts and supplies to and from orbit on a regular basis.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's vice president and program manager for commercial crew, said 80% of the work for certification is already in progress -- with the remaining 20% depending on CFT's outcome. \"There are likely going to be some kinds of flight anomalies or data that we need to collect from the CFT flight,\" Nappi said. \"We have to download that data and analyze it and understand it. And that's going to be part of what we bring to the certification review.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakedown_cruise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shakedown cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory_Bruno", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tory Bruno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_test_dummy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crash test dummy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Calypso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RV Calypso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacques Cousteau"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/geekwire_312/015d334c1e20efb301947cd1db361da4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 830, "textEnd": 835}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 962, "textEnd": 968}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Ms Williams overflew India on her way to space.\n\nShe lifted off onboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on the Atlas 5 rocket at 8:22 pm (IST) from the Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This is her third space flight.\n\nThe lift-off happened on the third attempt and was nominal. The Starliner got the correct orbit and will dock with the International Space Station a day later. Today, the US has three crewed spacecraft simultaneously in orbit - the Boeing Starliner, the SpaceX Crew Dragon, and the International Space Station.\n\nNASA says if all goes well the Starliner will dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module and Ms Williams and her co-passenger Butch Wilmore will remain at the space station for about a week to test the spacecraft and its subsystems before NASA works to complete the final certification of the transportation system for rotational missions to the orbiting laboratory as part of its Commercial Crew Program.\n\nThe Starliner has been designed for astronauts by astronauts and is the most modern crew module ever to be flown, NASA said.\n\nMs Williams, a poster girl for women aspiring to fly into space, flew into the skies in a brand-new spacecraft.\n\nEarlier, the Indian-origin astronaut had spent 322 days in space and held a record for the maximum hours of spacewalk by a woman, before being overtaken by Peggy Whitson.\n\nThis time, she makes history as the first woman to fly on a maiden crewed mission of a new space shuttle.\n\nThe 59-year-old admitted to being a bit nervous but said she had no jitters about flying in a new spacecraft that she helped design with engineers from NASA and Boeing. \"When I reach the International Space Station, it will be like going back home,\" she said.\n\nThe nearly 10-day mission will help the Starliner prove its space-worthiness. It would also prove the team's readiness to get a NASA certification and fly long-duration missions for the US space agency.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe Starliner is much behind schedule and way over the budget, with some saying that the problems plaguing Boeing in its aviation business may be spilling into its space business.\n\nIn 2014 NASA awarded a $4.2 billion contract for its making from scratch and ten years later it has not seen even a single successful human space flight. In contrast, Space X which was given a similar contract for the development of Crew Dragon was delivered at an estimated cost of $2.6 billion.

Inside the spacecraft are two NASA astronauts -- spaceflight veterans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams -- who are set to arrive to the station on Thursday.\n\nThe spacecraft lifted off at 10:55 a.m. ET from NASA's Kennedy Space Center aboard an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance (a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture). The lift-off comes after a string of delays that pushed the mission back by nearly a month, first due to issues with the Atlas rocket and later due to a problem with one of the three ground computers responsible for the launch countdown.\n\nWhile there are more milestones Starliner must hit before Boeing and NASA can call the mission a success -- docking to the ISS and eventually returning the astronauts back to Earth -- it's still a historic leap forward for the aerospace giant's long delayed astronaut transportation program.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Boeing will become NASA's second astronaut transportation provider, joining Elon Musk's SpaceX. Both companies were awarded multi-billion-dollar NASA contracts to develop a crewed taxi service a decade ago, but Boeing's program has been beset by technical delays that have run the company more than $1.5 billion over budget. Boeing did execute a successful uncrewed mission to the ISS in May 2022, but this is the first time the spacecraft has carried humans.\n\nWhile Boeing has struggled, SpaceX has soared: Using its Crew Dragon capsule, SpaceX has been providing astronaut transportation to and from the ISS since 2020.\n\nWilmore and Williams will make an around 26-hour journey to the ISS, with an anticipated arrival at around 12:15 p.m. EST Thursday. During their journey, they'll perform a handful of flight test objectives to support Strainer's certification for regular missions. They'll need to demonstrate the performance of crew equipment from prelaunch to ascent, and assess Starliner's thrust performance, test navigation systems, conduct communication checkouts, and evaluate life support systems.\n\nEven after Starliner autonomously docks to the station and the crew are onboard the ISS, the two astronauts will perform even more evaluations of the spacecraft's performance, including determining whether it can perform as a \"safe haven\" for astronauts in the unlikely event of an issue aboard the space station.\n\nWilmore and Williams will remain onboard the station for around a week before reboarding the spacecraft. After just six hours, Starliner is expected to make a landing under parachutes and assisted by airbags somewhere in the southwestern United States.\n\nThis is the last major step before Starliner can be certified as an operational crew system, and the first Starliner mission is expected to launch in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aria_alamalhodaei@techcrunch.com", "name": "Aria Alamalhodaei", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-support_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life-support system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1240755724.jpg?resize=1200,704", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The launch went smoothly after the program was plagued by delays. Boeing's spacecraft would give NASA a second option for human transport to space.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Boeing's Starliner launched toward the International Space Station carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nIt was the first crewed mission for the commercial spacecraft, which has been plagued by delays due to technical concerns.\n\nOn May 6, a pressure relief valve in the Atlas 5 rocket led to the first scrub. Then on June 1, there was an issue with the three ground computers that orchestrate the final countdown, which led to another delay.\n\nBut Wednesday's launch went smoothly, with the astronauts lifting off at 10:52 am ET. The crew later reached orbit safely.\n\nThe successful launch could shake up the commercial spaceflight market.\n\nRight now, SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft is NASA's main option for shuttling astronauts to and from space. The successful launch now suggests NASA could have a second option, removing SpaceX's US-based monopoly on human-to-space transport.\n\nBut first, Boeing needs to prove it can get Wilmore and Williams to the ISS and back home safely. Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to dock with the ISS at 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 6.\n\nCompared to SpaceX, Boeing has been slower to break into the commercial human-space transport business. In 2014, NASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX to build spacecraft to transport its astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nSpaceX began launching astronauts in 2020, but Boeing's effort was hit with costly delays. Musk wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that Boeing's issues were due to \"too many non-technical managers.\"\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams sat in Boeing's Starliner on Wednesday. Foto: NASA\n\nWednesday's launch isn't Wilmore's and Williams' first time in space. Both are seasoned astronauts and have each spent more than 150 days in space.\n\nBut this mission has been a long time coming for Wilmore and Williams. They've trained longer for this mission than Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins had for Apollo 11, The New York Times pointed out.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_orwig@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Jessica Orwig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "paul_squire@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Paul Squire", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Collins (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/666080fecc442a2f676e20a7-scaled.jpg?ver=1717603470", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 525, "textEnd": 530}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 610, "textEnd": 616}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1360, "textEnd": 1366}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

"Liftoff, finally: Boeing Starliner launches first crew on third try", "body": "The Boeing Starliner capsule blasted off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket at 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida\n\nBoeing on Wednesday launched its very first astronauts bound for the International Space Station aboard a Starliner capsule, which joins a select club of spacecraft to carry humans beyond Earth.\n\nThe third time turned out to be the charm for the aerospace giant, after two previous bids to fly with crew were aborted late into the countdown, for technical reasons.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both of whom have two previous spaceflights under their belts, blasted off at 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the station.\n\n\"Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you,\" Wilmore, who is commander of the test flight, said just before liftoff. \"Let's put some fire in this rocket, and let's push it to the heavens.\"\n\nStarliner becomes just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\nThe Starliner program has been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission will offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n- Embarrassing setbacks -\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nThe first crewed launch attempt on May 6 was scuppered in the final hours due to a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket the capsule sits atop.\n\nThen on Saturday, things were even more dramatic with liftoff aborted with less than four minutes left on the countdown clock as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nIn both cases, Wilmore and Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the first crewed launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nThe astronauts will now be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, they will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nia/des", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news",

The launch that marks Sunita's third foray into space is the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying the Boeing Starliner's 'Calypso' capsule lifted off from the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida, NASA said today.\n\nThe aerospace giant's mission was hit by multiple delays previously. Williams and Wilmore are now expected to spend more than 24 hours traveling to the International Space Station, and dock with it at 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nA previous attempt to launch the mission dubbed the Crew Flight Test was cancelled on Saturday, less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nThe launch is part of NASA's \"commercial crew programme\", which selected Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in the year 2011.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nWhile the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX company's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS since its first launch on May 30, 2020,\n\nBoeing's Starliner has been faced with multiple setbacks. Meanwhile the Starliner capsule will dock with the ISS and the astronauts will be at the ISS conducting a range of tests for about a week. Starliner will then undock from the ISS re-enter Earth's atmosphere and make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10, NASA said.\n\nSunita has traveled to space twice before, once on a NASA space shuttle in 2006 and then on a Russian Soyuz capsule in 2012 in an earlier. She's logged 322 total days in space.\n\nNASA selected Boeing and SpaceX in September 2014 to transport crew to the International Space Station from the United States. These integrated spacecraft, rockets and associated systems will carry up to four astronauts on NASA missions, maintaining a space station crew of seven to maximize time dedicated to scientific research on the orbiting laboratory.\n\nSunita and Barry Wilmore were both former commanders of the International Space Station.\n\nSunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nShe worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nBoeing has planned six manned missions for the platform over the next six years, the projected end of the ISS' operating lifespan.

Derrol Nail of NASA Communications said during a livestream that the team has been keeping an eye on the cumulus cloud forecast because if the rocket flies through cumulus clouds, it could create its own lightning strike.\n\nThe Starliner is designed to carry a seven-person crew, but aboard the \"test drive\" launch is NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a former U.S. Navy captain who will be commanding the flight, and Sunita Williams, 58, a former Navy service member who will be piloting the flight.\n\nA team from United Launch Alliance (ULA), which manufactures and operates the rockets that launch spacecraft into orbit, began loading cryogenic propellant into the rocket before the planned liftoff early this morning in a sign of launch being all set to go.\n\nWilmore and Williams entered the capsule around 8:00 a.m. ET, taking their seats and performing a series of checks including communications checks and suit checks, according to a post on X from Boeing Space.\n\nThis flight will be Wilmore's third mission to the ISS, NASA said during its Wednesday livestream. Williams is also on her third flight to space and will be the first woman on a test flight in an orbital spacecraft, according to NASA.\n\nAfter Starliner launches into orbit, it will be about a 24-hour journey to the ISS, during which the crew will test several flight objects, such as checking equipment, according to NASA.\n\nBoeing Space said Wilmore and Williams will pilot Starline manually at certain points to prove it can, despite the spacecraft being able to operate autonomously.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are expected to spend one week aboard the ISS and will be evaluating the spacecraft and its systems. Upon re-entry, the spacecraft will deploy parachutes and an airbag system, landing the pair in the western U.S.\n\nIt comes after the launch of Starliner was delayed several times.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out minutes before liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams - retired Navy captains and former space station residents - stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries - Russia, the U.S. and China - had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Docking maneuvers with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been Nasa's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe single-engine Atlas V upper stage was expected to separate from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight and carry the Starliner farther into space, where it was due to separate from the upper stage about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran Nasa astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author",

As it was for Starliner, this was also the first time astronauts have launched atop an Atlas V in its 22-year flight history.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\n\"We all know that when the going gets tough, as it often does, the tough get going, and you all have,\" Wilmore said while waiting on the pad for liftoff. \"Let's get going, let's put some fire in this rocket. \"\n\n\"Let's go Calyspo, take us to space and back,\" pilot Sunita Williams said just minutes before launch, referring to the name of the Starliner capsule.\n\nStarliner is headed toward the International Space Station (ISS), where Wilmore and Williams will spend about eight days putting the spacecraft through a series of tests toward operational crew certification. Rendezvous is scheduled for Thursday (June 6) around 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT). You can follow the mission with our Starliner live updates page.\n\nThe fiery launch brings NASA within reach of a goal the agency set more than a decade ago: getting two American commercial vehicles up and running for astronaut missions to the ISS. It's been a long road to get here, as the roots of this goal go back to at least 2006.\n\nThe newly launched Starliner mission, a roughly 10-day jaunt known as Crew Flight Test (CFT), was originally scheduled to lift off on May 6. But that attempt was scrubbed about two hours before launch, when team members noticed a \"buzzing\" valve on the Atlas V's upper stage.\n\nULA decided to replace the valve, which required rolling the rocket off the pad and back to the company's vertical integration facility. That work delayed the planned liftoff until May 17, but then another issue arose: a slight helium leak in one of the reaction-control thrusters in Starliner's service module.\n\nThe mission team took more time to analyze the leak and its potential consequences, ultimately deeming it a minor issue and clearing CFT for a planned June 1 liftoff. \"Sometimes, for spaceflight, you plan for contingencies, and you design the vehicle to have margin,\" Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, said during a pre-launch press briefing on Friday (May 31).\n\n\"We have margin in the helium tank,\" he added. \"We could handle a leak that's 100 times worse than this. So [...] we concluded that the smartest thing to do was to go fly the mission, and we could fly it safely.\"\n\nThe June 1 attempt, however, was aborted just minutes before liftoff thanks to a failed power distribution source in the ground equipment. The mission team replaced the faulty gear, setting CFT up for its launch today.\n\nCFT aims to check out Starliner thoroughly ahead of certifying the spacecraft for longer missions. Williams and Wilmore will do some manual flying, test emergency scenarios like losing communications or power, and do a lot of debriefing to ensure that future Starliner crews know what to expect.\n\nIf all goes well on CFT, Starliner will carry its first astronaut crew for about six months to the ISS, perhaps as early as 2025. Starliner-1, that first operational flight, will carry NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Scott Tingle along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Josh Kutryk. The Starliner-1 crew is already deep in training, and Fincke served as backup for CFT as well.\n\nCommercial crew's genesis extends back to the commercial cargo program, which was first funded in 2006, as NASA used similar models to get private robotic and crewed vehicles running to the ISS. Until then, only government programs had sent supplies to the orbiting lab; agency officials turned to industry to nurture those companies' independence and resilience while, ideally, saving on taxpayer cost.\n\nCommercial cargo nurtured the development of SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus vehicle, both of which have been flying robotic resupply missions to the ISS for more than a decade, and will soon send Sierra Space's Dream Chaser to space as well. The success of cargo development helped NASA award its first commercial crew contracts in 2010, collectively totaling $50 million (worth about $72 million in 2024 dollars) to five companies.\n\nThe quintet included Blue Origin, Boeing, Paragon Space Development Corp., Sierra Nevada (now Sierra Space) and ULA, each of which received support under CCDev-1 (Commercial Crew Development-1) for several human spaceflight technologies. ULA's funding helped certify the Atlas V for human missions.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, several new rounds of commercial crew funding brought extra support to Boeing, SpaceX and a range of other companies. CCDev-2, announced in April 2011, awarded a total of $270 million to Blue Origin, Boeing, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX. (Boeing got $92 million in this round for Starliner, while SpaceX's $75 million went toward the development of Crew Dragon.)\n\nThe funding increased with Commercial Crew integrated Capability (CCiCap) in August 2012, as NASA also narrowed the field to three companies: Sierra Nevada received $212 million for Dream Chaser, while Boeing and SpaceX got $460 million and $440 million, respectively.\n\nSpaceX and Boeing then received the last major contract for final development work, known as Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap), in September 2014. Boeing's deal was worth $4.2 billion back then, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. The money was also meant to cover six operational crewed flights to and from the ISS.\n\nAs is common with big spaceflight projects, lots of logistical and technical obstacles arose for both companies' spacecraft. NASA wanted the two CCtCap awardees to fly astronauts in 2017, but SpaceX's first such test flight launched in 2020, while Boeing's was delayed even longer, until today.\n\nLots of things contributed to the wait. Congress repeatedly gave less money than the White House and NASA requested for commercial crew, and technical obstacles arose. Boeing's solutions, however, took more flights and more time than SpaceX's.\n\nSpaceX has sent 12 crewed missions to the ISS to date, including the 63-day Demo-2 test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley in 2020. Their mission had been expected to launch in 2019, shortly after an uncrewed Crew Dragon successfully reached the ISS for the first time that March. But only a month later, that Dragon exploded during a ground test of its launch-abort system. SpaceX, as one would expect, put off human launches until it could address the mishap cause, which turned out to be a faulty valve.\n\nStarliner's issues were more complex. Its own first uncrewed mission, called Orbital Flight Test (OFT), never reached the ISS as planned in December 2019. The capsule's timing system got confused, and Starliner became stuck in an orbit that made it impossible to rendezvous with its destination. The investigation was complex and lengthy, requiring dozens of fixes, and the pandemic's arrival in early 2020 further delayed schedules due to supply chain problems and social distancing requirements.\n\nStarliner's next uncrewed flight met up with the ISS flawlessly in May 2022, but its road to crewed flights faced another obstacle in 2023. Late in CFT's training flow, new issues with the spacecraft were discovered, requiring extra fixes ahead of flight. The most pressing concerned the main parachutes (which carried less load than engineers thought) and the capsule wiring (which, as it turned out, was largely wrapped in flammable P213 tape).\n\nThe CFT astronauts, and Boeing and NASA, have repeatedly said these issues are behind them, although new issues could arise during CFT. Wilmore has also downplayed CFT as being the one thing determining Starliner's success; he frames all stages of development for astronauts as \"vitally important.\"\n\n\"This is human spaceflight,\" Wilmore explained to reporters in a livestreamed press conference on April 25, when he and Williams arrived at KSC for quarantine, training and launch preparations ahead of the May 6 attempt. \"You know that adage you've heard since Apollo 13: failure is not an option. And that has nothing specifically to do with Boeing or this program. That's all things that we do in human spaceflight.\"\n\nIn addition, a failure of a parachute to fully open during Blue Origin's recent NS-25 suborbital crewed launch prompted Boeing to double-check Starliner's own parachute systems.\n\n\"Starliner uses some similar components to [the New Shepard] parachute system,\" Stich explained during the May 31 briefing. According to Stich, Blue Origin provided NS-25 flight data with NASA, SpaceX and Boeing, allowing engineers to ensure the functionality of specific components. And, after examining the data, Stich said it was determined Starliner was \"good to go fly.\"\n\nWith the ISS expected to continue flying until at least 2030, the plan going forward is for three different spacecraft to carry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Aside from Dragon and Starliner, Russia will continue to send cosmonaut-led crews using its Soyuz spacecraft until at least 2028, when the nation's commitment to the partnership is scheduled to expire.\n\nSome NASA astronauts continue to use Soyuz for policy reasons, and also because the space station partners want as many backups as possible in case of technical problems with any one spacecraft.\n\nAs for private Starliner astronaut missions aside from NASA obligations for ISS, Boeing officials have said repeatedly that they want to focus on fulfilling their NASA contract first.\n\nIn the May 31 briefing, Fincke said that CFT \"will help continue the certification process for Starliner, so that Starliner 1, 2, 3, to infinity and beyond, can fly and provide services to the International Space Station, and it's up to Boeing, but other other missions available out there too.\"\n\nBesides that, CFT \"really is all of our attention at this point,\" Mark Nappi, Boeing's commercial crew program manager, told reporters on April 25. With at least six more years of ISS flights to plan for, \"we've got plenty of time to think about what's after that,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "scientificamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scientific American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_howell@scientificamerican.com", "name": "Elizabeth Howell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Nevada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northrop Grumman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

Now, the US space agency is making every effort to ensure a safe flight despite the setbacks.\n\nThe final preparations are underway for the launch of the Starliner Crew's test flight to the International Space Station, NASA said, adding that Boeing's Starliner spacecraft and United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas V rocket are back at the launch pad at the Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe last launch scheduled for June 1, 2024, was scrubbed less than four minutes before liftoff as one of the ground computers flagged a technical issue in the rocket. The ULA said it has replaced the faulty computer parts that put a hold on the mission.\n\nAn earlier attempt on May 7, 2024, was postponed hours before liftoff due to a technical glitch involving a valve. \"Boeing, United Launch Alliance, and NASA scrubbed the previous launch opportunity on May 7 (India time) due to a suspect oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur second stage. Since then, teams have removed and replaced the valve, and completed an assessment of the Starliner's performance and redundancy after discovering a small helium leak in the spacecraft's service module,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nWith two launches called off, the Starliner is much delayed and way over budget. Some say that the problems plaguing Boeing's aviation business may also be spilling into its space business.\n\nIn 2014, NASA awarded a $4.2 billion contract to Boeing to build a spacecraft from scratch. Ten years later, it has not seen a single successful human space flight. In contrast, Space X which was given a similar contract for the development of Crew Dragon was delivered at an estimated cost of $2.6 billion. SpaceX is already ferrying astronauts to the ISS on its crew module.\n\nMs Williams, a poster girl for women aspiring to fly into space, is set to reach for the skies again in the brand-new spacecraft. This will be the third space travel for the Indian-origin astronaut, who has spent 322 days in space and held a record for the maximum number of spacewalk hours by a woman, before being overtaken by Peggy Whitson.\n\nThis time, she could make history as the first woman to fly on a maiden crewed mission on a brand new space shuttle.\n\nMs Williams's first space voyage was from December 9, 2006, to June 22, 2007. While on board, she scripted a record for women with four spacewalks clocking 29 hours and 17 minutes.\n\nAhead of her third space journey, the 59-year-old admitted to being a bit nervous but maintained that she has no jitters about flying the new spacecraft that she helped design, working with engineers from NASA and Boeing.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"When I reach the International Space Station, it will be like going back home,\" she said.\n\nOn her past flights, she carried her \"lucky charm\" - an idol of Lord Ganesh, and a copy of the Bhagwad Gita.

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA Astronauts Pilot First Starliner Crewed Test to Station\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are safely in orbit on the first crewed flight test aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft bound for the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, the astronauts lifted off at 9:52 a.m. CDT June 5 on a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on an end-to-end test of the Starliner system.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 11:15 a.m. June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nWilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\nFollow mission updates here.\n\nThe Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center provides engineering and mission operations support for the space station, the Commercial Crew Program, and Artemis missions, as well as science and technology demonstration missions. The Payload Operations Integration Center within HOSC operates, plans, and coordinates the science experiments onboard the space station 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. The Commercial Crew Program support team at Marshall provides crucial programmatic, engineering, and safety and mission assurance expertise for launch vehicles, spacecraft propulsion, and integrated vehicle performance.\n\nA flag-raising ceremony was held May 2 outside the HOSC for Marshall's support of the mission. The ceremony was a joint effort between the Payload and Mission Operations Division and Commercial Crew Program team.\n\nJoseph Pelfrey, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, was a key presenter at the 29th annual Tennessee Valley Corridor National Summit, hosted by Vanderbilt University in Nashville on May 29 and 30.\n\nThe event drew some 300 attendees, including government representatives, members of the public, and industry and academic stakeholders from across the corridor's five-state region, which includes Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n\nPelfrey addressed summit attendees May 30 as part of a session on \"Exploring and Discovering Through Science, Research, and Space.\" He noted that Marshall will embrace a transformative shift, including a transition toward small- and medium-sized programs enabled by strategic partnerships, helping NASA prepare for a future in which astronauts live and work on the Moon and prepare for crewed missions to Mars.\n\nThat paradigm shift will rely heavily on \"the talent, innovation, and infrastructure available in the Tennessee Valley, (enabling) us to accelerate progress in space exploration, scientific research, and technology development,\" Pelfrey added.\n\nHe also emphasized that there is much more to come for Marshall, with the center continuing to serve as a trusted technical solutions provider for NASA and its partners. Pelfrey highlighted how harnessing the center's deep technical expertise for future missions will help drive innovation, reduce costs, and accelerate shared goals for advanced space exploration.\n\nPelfrey offered a detailed look at NASA's successful Artemis I launch in 2022 and the upcoming Artemis II mission, which will send the first woman and first person of color to deep space to conduct a lunar fly-by - the final checkout before Artemis III lands Americans on the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. Pelfrey also discussed Marshall's role in managing NASA's SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, the backbone of the agency's Artemis-era endeavors, and identified new and upcoming programs and efforts geared to expand the center's role in deep-space science and exploration.\n\nHe noted that much of that work has had a direct effect on the state of Tennessee and on industry and academia across the corridor.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021 alone, NASA's economic impact supported more than 1,600 jobs and generated more than $340 million in Tennessee alone, including $119 million in labor income. More broadly, since 2015, NASA has enacted 97 Cooperative Agreements with partners across the five-state corridor. Eighty-two of those were with universities, including six minority-serving institutions. Of the 15 industry agreements, 11 created partnerships with small businesses.\n\n\"This is truly an exciting time to live and work in the Tennessee Valley,\" Pelfrey said, \"and to be part of the space community.\"\n\nOther summit speakers included Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Rep. Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee's 3rd district, and Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee's 7th district; Corey Hinderstein, deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; Dr. Steven Streiffer, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and Dr. Robert Lindquist, vice president for research and economic development at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.\n\nPanels and seminars included discussion of American security, global economic leadership, new energy solutions, workforce development, and the emergence of AI technology. More than 20 businesses and academic institutions - including representatives from SLS, the Human Landing Systems Program Office, the Space Nuclear Propulsion Project Office, and other Marshall organizations - engaged with summit participants and promoted current and future NASA endeavors at a trade-show expo in the Vanderbilt Student Life Center.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Corridor was founded in 1995 to foster collaboration between government, academia, and industry, to champion regional economic leadership, and to promote partnerships in national security, science, space, transportation, environment, energy, education, and workforce development. Its 2023 national summit was held in Huntsville.\n\nSmith, an Aeyon/MTS employee, supports the Marshall Office of Communications.\n\n\" Back to Top\n\nDavey Jones has been named center strategy lead at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, following the reassignment of Jeramie Broadway, effective June 2.\n\nAs center strategy lead for the Office of the Center Director, Jones will lead and implement the director's strategic vision, leveraging and integrating Marshall's strategic business units, in coordination and collaboration with all center organizations, and to ensure alignment with the agency's strategic priorities.\n\nHe moves into his new role after being the manager of the Program Planning & Control Office within the HLS (Human Landing Systems) Program at Marshall since 2020. In that capacity, Jones' primary role was managing the program's budget, schedule, risk, and other programmatic functions. He has worked in multiple roles throughout his career, focused on the formulation of key programs and projects for Marshall, including development of technology upgrades for life support systems on the International Space Station, formulation of the SLS (Space Launch System) Block 1B vehicle and exploration upper stage, and leading various human exploration architecture studies for the Moon and Mars.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2020, he was the Environmental Control and Life Support System Integration and Development manager for the International Space Station Projects Office in the Human Exploration Development and Operations Office. Jones was senior technical assistant to Marshall's associate director, technical, from 2016-2017. Prior to that, he was SLS stages alternate lead systems engineer from 2014-2016. A U.S. Navy veteran, he began his NASA career in 2008 in the Advanced Concepts Office.\n\nJones' honors include a NASA Early Career Achievement Medal, Marshall Engineering Director's Award, and a Human Exploration Framework Team Group Achievement Award.\n\nA native of Lakeland, Florida, he earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Alabama in Huntsville.\n\n\" Back to Top\n\nImages from the November 2023 flyby of asteroid Dinkinesh by NASA's Lucy spacecraft show a trough on Dinkinesh where a large piece - about a quarter of the asteroid - suddenly shifted, a ridge, and a separate contact binary satellite (now known as Selam). Scientists say this complicated structure shows that Dinkinesh and Selam have significant internal strength and a complex, dynamic history.\n\n\"We want to understand the strengths of small bodies in our solar system because that's critical for understanding how planets like Earth got here,\" said Hal Levison, Lucy principal investigator at the Boulder, Colorado, branch of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. \"Basically, the planets formed when zillions of smaller objects orbiting the Sun, like asteroids, ran into each other. How objects behave when they hit each other, whether they break apart or stick together, has a lot to do with their strength and internal structure.\" Levison is lead author of a paper on these observations published May 29 in Nature.\n\nResearchers think that Dinkinesh is revealing its internal structure by how it has responded to stress. Over millions of years rotating in the sunlight, the tiny forces coming from the thermal radiation emitted from the asteroid's warm surface generated a small torque that caused Dinkinesh to gradually rotate faster, building up centrifugal stresses until part of the asteroid shifted into a more elongated shape. This event likely caused debris to enter into a close orbit, which became the raw material that produced the ridge and satellite.\n\nIf Dinkinesh were much weaker, more like a fluid pile of sand, its particles would have gradually moved toward the equator and flown off into orbit as it spun faster. However, the images suggest that it was able to hold together longer, more like a rock, with more strength than a fluid, eventually giving way under stress and fragmenting into large pieces. (Although the amount of strength needed to fragment a small asteroid like Dinkinesh is miniscule compared to most rocks on Earth.)\n\n\"The trough suggests an abrupt failure, more an earthquake with a gradual buildup of stress and then a sudden release, instead of a slow process like a sand dune forming,\" said Keith Noll of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, project scientist for Lucy and a co-author of the paper.\n\n\"These features tell us that Dinkinesh has some strength, and they let us do a little historical reconstruction to see how this asteroid evolved,\" Levison said. \"It broke, things moved apart and formed a disk of material during that failure, some of which rained back onto the surface to make the ridge.\"\n\nThe researchers think some of the material in the disk formed the moon Selam, which is actually two objects touching each other, a configuration called a contact binary. Details of how this unusual moon formed remain mysterious.\n\nDinkinesh and its satellite are the first two of 11 asteroids that Lucy's team plans to explore over its 12-year journey. After skimming the inner edge of the main asteroid belt, Lucy is now heading back toward Earth for a gravity assist in December 2024. That close flyby will propel the spacecraft back through the main asteroid belt, where it will observe asteroid Donaldjohanson in 2025, and then on to the first of the encounters with the Trojan asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit of the Sun beginning in 2027.\n\nLucy's principal investigator is based out of the Boulder, Colorado, branch of Southwest Research Institute, headquartered in San Antonio. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and safety and mission assurance. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built and operates the spacecraft. Lucy is the 13th mission in NASA's Discovery Program. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center manages the Discovery Program for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters.\n\n\" Back to Top\n\nCrews rotated to vertical then lifted NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft from its protective shipping container after it arrived at the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at the agency's Kennedy Space Center on May 28.\n\nThe spacecraft, which will collect data to help scientists determine if Jupiter's icy moon Europa could support life, arrived in a United States Air Force C-17 Globemaster III cargo plane at Kennedy's Launch and Landing Facility on May 23. The hardware traveled more than 2,500 miles from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Southern California where it was assembled. The team transported Europa Clipper to the facility and will perform a number of activities to prepare it for launch, including attaching the high gain antenna, affixing solar arrays to power the spacecraft, and loading propellants that will help guide the spacecraft to its destination.\n\nOn board are nine science instruments to gather detailed measurements while Europa Clipper performs approximately 50 close flybys of the Jovian moon. Research suggests an ocean twice the volume of all the Earth's oceans exists under Europa's icy crust.\n\nThe Europa Clipper spacecraft will launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA Kennedy's Launch Complex 39A. The launch period opens Oct. 10.\n\nManaged by Caltech in Pasadena, California, JPL leads the development of the Europa Clipper mission in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. APL designed the main spacecraft body in collaboration with JPL and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The Planetary Missions Program Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center executes program management of the Europa Clipper mission.\n\n\" Back to Top\n\nA new project provides special 3D \"experiences\" on Instagram using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes through augmented reality (AR), allowing users to travel virtually through objects in space. These new experiences of astronomical objects - including the debris fields of exploded stars - are being released to help celebrate the 25 anniversary of operations from Chandra, NASA's flagship X-ray telescope.\n\nIn recent years, Instagram experiences (previously referred to as filters) of NASA mission control, the International Space Station, and the Perseverance Rover on Mars have allowed participants to virtually explore what NASA does. This new set of Chandra Instagram filters joins this space-themed collection.\n\n\"We are excited to bring data from the universe down to earth in this way,\" said Kimberly Arcand, visualization and emerging technology scientist at the Chandra X-ray Center. \"By enabling people to access cosmic data on their phones and through AR, it brings Chandra's amazing discoveries literally right to your fingertips.\"\n\nThe new Instagram experiences are created from 3D models based on data collected by Chandra and other telescopes along with mathematical models. Traditionally, it has been very difficult to gather 3D data of objects in our galaxy due to their two-dimensional projection on the sky. New instruments and techniques, however, have helped allowed astronomers in recent years to construct more data-driven models of what these distant objects look like in three dimensions.\n\nThese advancements in astronomy have paralleled the explosion of opportunities in virtual, extended, and augmented reality. Such technologies provide virtual digital experiences, which now extend beyond Earth and into the cosmos. This new set of Chandra Instagram experiences was made possible by a collaboration including NASA, the Smithsonian Institution, and students and researchers at Brown University.\n\nThese Instagram experiences also include data sonifications of the celestial objects. Sonification is the process of translating data into sounds and notes so users can hear representations of the data, an accessibility project the Chandra team has led for the past four years.\n\n\"These Chandra Instagram experiences are another way to share these cosmic data with the public,\" Arcand said. \"We are hoping this helps reach new audiences, especially those who like to get their information through social media.\"\n\nThe objects in the new Chandra Instagram experience collection include the Tycho supernova remnant, the Vela Pulsar, the Helix Nebula, the Cat's Eye Nebula, and the Chandra spacecraft. The 3D models of the first three objects were done in conjunction with Sal Orlando, an astrophysicist at Italy's National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) in Palmero. The Cat's Eye Nebula was created with data from Ryan Clairmont, physics researcher and undergraduate at Stanford University. Arcand worked with Brown's Tom Sgouros and his team, research assistant Alexander Dupuis and undergraduate Healey Koch, on the Chandra Instagram filters.\n\nThe experiences include text that explains what users are looking at. The effects are free and available on Instagram on mobile devices for at least six months, and some will remain viewable in perpetuity on the Smithsonian's Voyager 3D website.\n\n\"There is a lot of rich and beautiful data associated with these models that Healey and I looked to bring in, which we did by creating the textures on the models as well as programming visual effects for displaying them in AR,\" Dupuis said.\n\nNASA's Marshall Space Flight Center manages the Chandra program. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Chandra X-ray Center controls science from Cambridge Massachusetts and flight operations from Burlington, Massachusetts. The Chandra X-ray Center is headquartered at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, which is part of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian.\n\nThe most sensitive instrument ever built to measure quakes and meteor strikes on other worlds is getting closer to its journey to the mysterious far side of the Moon. It's one of two seismometers adapted for the lunar surface from instruments originally designed for NASA's InSight Mars lander, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before the mission's conclusion in 2022.\n\nPart of a payload called Farside Seismic Suite (FSS) that was recently assembled at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the two seismometers are expected to arrive in 2026 at Schr\u00f6dinger basin, a wide impact crater about 300 miles from the Moon's South Pole. The self-sufficient, solar-powered suite has its own computer and communications equipment, plus the ability to protect itself from the extreme heat of lunar daytime and the frigid conditions of night.\n\nAfter being delivered to the surface by a lunar lander under NASA's CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative, the suite will return the agency's first seismic data from the Moon since the last Apollo program seismometers were in operation nearly 50 years ago. Not only that, but it will also provide the first-ever seismic measurements from the Moon's far side.\n\nUp to 30 times more sensitive than its Apollo predecessors, the suite will record the Moon's seismic \"background\" vibration, which is driven by micrometeorites the size of small pebbles that pelt the surface. This will help NASA better understand the current impact environment as the agency prepares to send Artemis astronauts to explore the lunar surface.\n\nPlanetary scientists are eager to see what FSS tells them about the Moon's internal activity and structure. What they learn will offer insights into how the Moon - as well as rocky planets like Mars and Earth - formed and evolved.\n\nIt will also answer a lingering question about moonquakes: Why did the Apollo instruments on the lunar near side detect little far-side seismic activity? One possible explanation is that something in the Moon's deep structure essentially absorbs far-side quakes, making them harder for Apollo's seismometers to have sensed. Another is that there are fewer quakes on the far side, which on the surface looks very different from the side that faces Earth.\n\n\"FSS will offer answers to questions we've been asking about the Moon for decades,\" said Mark Panning, the FSS principal investigator at JPL and project scientist for InSight. \"We cannot wait to start getting this data back.\"\n\nFarside Seismic Suite's two complementary instruments were adapted from InSight designs to perform in lunar gravity - less than half that of Mars, which, in turn, is about a third of Earth's. They're packaged together with a battery, the computer, and electronics inside a cube structure that's surrounded by insulation and an outer protective cube. Perched atop the lander, the suite will gather data continuously for at least 4\u00bd months, operating through the long, cold lunar nights.\n\nThe Very Broadband seismometer, or VBB, is the most sensitive seismometer ever built for use in space exploration: It can detect ground motions smaller than the size of a single hydrogen atom. A fat cylinder about 5 inches in diameter, it measures up-and-down movement using a pendulum held in place by a spring. It was originally constructed as an emergency replacement instrument (a \"flight spare\") for InSight by the French space agency, CNES (Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales).\n\nPhilippe Lognonn\u00e9 of Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, the principal investigator for InSight's seismometer, is an FSS co-investigator and VBB instrument lead. \"We learned so much about Mars from this instrument, and now we are thrilled with the opportunity to turn that experience toward the mysteries of the Moon,\" he said.\n\nThe suite's smaller seismometer, called the Short Period sensor, or SP, was built by Kinemetrics in Pasadena, California, in collaboration with the University of Oxford and Imperial College, London. The puck-shaped device measures motion in three directions using sensors etched into a trio of square silicon chips each about 1 inch wide.\n\nThe FSS payload came together at JPL over the last year. In recent weeks, it survived rigorous environmental testing in vacuum and extreme temperatures that simulate space, along with severe shaking that mimics the rocket's motion during launch.\n\n\"The JPL team has been excited from the beginning that we're going to the Moon with our French colleagues,\" said JPL's Ed Miller, FSS project manager and, like Panning and Lognonn\u00e9, a veteran of the InSight mission. \"We went to Mars together, and now we'll be able to look up at the Moon and know we built something up there. It'll make us so proud.\"\n\nA division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, JPL manages, designed, assembled, and tested Farside Seismic Suite. The French space agency, CNES (Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales), and IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris) provided the suite's Very Broadband seismometer with support from Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9 and the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). Imperial College, London and the University of Oxford collaborated to provide the Short Period sensor, managed by Kinemetrics in Pasadena. The University of Michigan provided the flight computer, power electronics, and associated software.\n\nA selection of NASA's PRISM (Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon), FSS is funded by the Exploration Science Strategy and Integration Office within the agency's Science Mission Directorate. The Planetary Missions Program Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center provides program management. FSS will land on the Moon as part of an upcoming lunar delivery under NASA's CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative.\n\n\" Back to Top\n\nThe physics remain the same, but the rockets, spacecraft, landers, and spacesuits are new as NASA and its industry partners prepare for Artemis astronauts to walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972.\n\nNASA astronaut Doug \"Wheels\" Wheelock and Axiom Space astronaut Peggy Whitson put on spacesuits, developed by Axiom Space, to interact with and evaluate full-scale developmental hardware of SpaceX's Starship HLS (Human Landing System) that will be used for landing humans on the Moon under Artemis. The test, conducted April 30, marked the first time astronauts in pressurized spacesuits interacted with a test version of Starship HLS hardware.\n\n\"With Artemis, NASA is going to the Moon in a whole new way, with international partners and industry partners like Axiom Space and SpaceX. These partners are contributing their expertise and providing integral parts of the deep space architecture that they develop with NASA's insight and oversight,\" said Amit Kshatriya, NASA's Moon to Mars program manager. \"Integrated tests like this one, with key programs and partners working together, are crucial to ensure systems operate smoothly and are safe and effective for astronauts before they take the next steps on the Moon.\"\n\nThe day-long test, conducted at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, provided NASA and its partners with valuable feedback on the layout, physical design, mechanical assemblies, and clearances inside the Starship HLS, as well as the flexibility and agility of the suits, known as the AxEMU (Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit).\n\nTo begin the test, Wheelock and Whitson put on the spacesuits in the full-scale airlock that sits on Starship's airlock deck. Suits were then pressurized using a system immediately outside the HLS airlock that provided air, electrical power, cooling, and communications to the astronauts. Each AxEMU also included a full-scale model of the Portable Life Support System, or \"backpack,\" on the back of the suits. For Artemis moonwalks, each crew member will put on a spacesuit with minimal assistance, so the team was eager to evaluate how easily the suits can be put on, taken off, and stowed in the airlock.\n\nDuring the test, NASA and SpaceX engineers were also able to evaluate placement of mobility aids, such as handrails, for traversing the hatch. Another set of mobility aids, straps hanging from the ceiling in the airlock, assisted the astronauts when entering and removing the AxEMU suits. The astronauts also practiced interacting with a control panel in the airlock, ensuring controls could be reached and activated while the astronauts were wearing gloves.\n\n\"Overall, I was pleased with the astronauts' operation of the control panel and with their ability to perform the difficult tasks they will have to do before stepping onto the Moon,\" said Logan Kennedy, lead for surface activities in NASA's HLS Program. \"The test also confirmed that the amount of space available in the airlock, on the deck, and in the elevator, are sufficient for the work our astronauts plan to do.\"\n\nThe suited astronauts also walked the from Starship's airlock deck to the elevator built for testing. During Artemis missions, the elevator will take NASA astronauts and their equipment from the deck to the lunar surface for a moonwalk and then back again. Whitson and Wheelock practiced opening a gate to enter the elevator while evaluating the dexterity of the AxEMU suit gloves, and practiced lowering the ramp that astronauts will use to take the next steps on the Moon.\n\nThe steps the astronauts took in the spacesuits through full-scale builds of the Starship hatch, airlock, airlock deck, and elevator may have been small, but they marked an important step toward preparing for a new generation of moonwalks as part of Artemis.\n\nFor the Artemis III mission, SpaceX will provide the Starship HLS that will dock with Orion in lunar orbit and take two astronauts to and from the surface of the Moon. Axiom Space is providing a new generation of spacesuits for moonwalks that are designed to fit a wider range of astronauts.\n\nWith Artemis, NASA will explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work away from home, and prepare for future human exploration of the Red Planet. NASA's SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, exploration ground systems, and Orion spacecraft, along with the human landing system, next-generation spacesuits, Gateway lunar space station, and future rovers are NASA's foundation for deep space exploration.", "source": {"uri": "nasa.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The launch that marks Sunita's third foray into space is the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history.\n\nNASA's Boeing Starliner spacecraft piloted by Indian-origin Sunita 'Suni' Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Barry 'Butch' Williams lifted off to space on its historic maiden voyage toward the International Space Station. Sunita is the first female astronaut to fly on the first flight of a crewed spacecraft. The launch that marks Sunita's third foray into space is the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying the Boeing Starliner's 'Calypso' capsule lifted off from the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida, NASA said today. The aerospace giant's mission was hit by multiple delays previously. Williams and Wilmore are now expected to spend more than 24 hours traveling to the International Space Station, and dock with it at 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nA previous attempt to launch the mission dubbed the Crew Flight Test was cancelled on Saturday, less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold. The problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nThe launch is part of NASA's \"commercial crew programme\", which selected Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in the year 2011. Boeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nWhile the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX company's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS since its first launch on May 30, 2020, Boeing's Starliner has been faced with multiple setbacks. Meanwhile the Starliner capsule will dock with the ISS and the astronauts will be at the ISS conducting a range of tests for about a week. Starliner will then undock from the ISS re-enter Earth's atmosphere and make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10, NASA said.\n\nSunita has traveled to space twice before, once on a NASA space shuttle in 2006 and then on a Russian Soyuz capsule in 2012 in an earlier. She's logged 322 total days in space. NASA selected Boeing and SpaceX in September 2014 to transport crew to the International Space Station from the United States. These integrated spacecraft, rockets and associated systems will carry up to four astronauts on NASA missions, maintaining a space station crew of seven to maximize time dedicated to scientific research on the orbiting laboratory.\n\nSunita and Barry Wilmore were both former commanders of the International Space Station. Sunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA. While onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks. She worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.

We were all excited. This is kind of the way space flight is.\"\n\nIn that news conference, officials said the countdown clock automatically stopped due to a \"failed power distribution source\" on ULA's Atlas V rocket, which initially triggered a launch hold. However, the rocket had an instantaneous launch window, meaning it had to launch at a precise time.\n\nThe teams replaced the part over the weekend.\n\n\"I really appreciate all the work by the NASA, Boeing and ULA teams over the last week,\" Stich said.\n\n\"In particular, the ULA team worked really hard to quickly learn more about these issues, keep our NASA and Boeing teams informed and protect for this next attempt. We will continue to take it one step at a time.\"\n\nIn 2014, NASA gave contracts to both SpaceX and Boeing to provide a new spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), as the space agency had mothballed its space shuttle program and was reliant solely on Russian Soyuz rockets.\n\nSpaceX successfully began launching astronauts to the ISS in 2020. However, Boeing has faced several setbacks and cost overruns, and has yet to conduct a successful crewed test launch.\n\nSaturday's scrub follows a previous attempt on May 6, which was called off due to an oxygen leak on ULA's Atlas V rocket.\n\nHowever, issues with the spacecraft were discovered once the rocket was rolled back to ULA's Vertical Integration Facility, which also included a helium leak, which was not fixed ahead of Saturday's launch.\n\nNASA and Boeing said that there was no danger to the astronauts launching with such a small leak.\n\nA second issue pertaining to how Starliner would deorbit and return to Earth was discovered and a workaround was developed.\n\nIf the launch happens as scheduled, Williams and Wilmore will dock with the ISS on June 6 at 12:15 p.m. ET.\n\nAnd once again, it'll be Canadian astronaut Joshua Kutryk who will be speaking to the pair from NASA's Capcom, or capsule communicator, leading up to and during their launch. He is scheduled to fly the first operational flight (not a test, as this one is) of Starliner in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Crew-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Crew-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kutryk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kutryk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7224083.1717516280!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/boeing-starliner-cst-100.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1802, "textEnd": 1807}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2393, "textEnd": 2399}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

As it was for Starliner, this was also the first time astronauts have launched atop an Atlas V in its 22-year flight history.\n\nStarliner is headed toward the International Space Station (ISS), where Wilmore and Williams will spend about eight days putting the spacecraft through a series of tests toward operational crew certification. Rendezvous is scheduled for Thursday (June 6) around 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT). You can follow the mission with our Starliner live updates page.\n\nThe fiery launch brings NASA within reach of a goal the agency set more than a decade ago: getting two American commercial vehicles up and running for astronaut missions to the ISS. It's been a long road to get here, as the roots of this goal go back to at least 2006.\n\nThe newly launched Starliner mission, a roughly 10-day jaunt known as Crew Flight Test (CFT), was originally scheduled to lift off on May 6. But that attempt was scrubbed about two hours before launch, when team members noticed a \"buzzing\" valve on the Atlas V's upper stage.\n\nULA decided to replace the valve, which required rolling the rocket off the pad and back to the company's vertical integration facility. That work delayed the planned liftoff until May 17, but then another issue arose: a slight helium leak in one of the reaction-control thrusters in Starliner's service module.\n\nThe mission team took more time to analyze the leak and its potential consequences, ultimately deeming it a minor issue and clearing CFT for a planned June 1 liftoff. \"Sometimes, for spaceflight, you plan for contingencies, and you design the vehicle to have margin,\" Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, said during a pre-launch press briefing on Friday (May 31).\n\n\"We have margin in the helium tank,\" he added. \"We could handle a leak that's 100 times worse than this. So [...] we concluded that the smartest thing to do was to go fly the mission, and we could fly it safely.\"\n\nThe June 1 attempt, however, was aborted just minutes before liftoff thanks to a failed power distribution source in the ground equipment. The mission team replaced the faulty gear, setting CFT up for its launch today.\n\nCFT aims to check out Starliner thoroughly ahead of certifying the spacecraft for longer missions. Williams and Wilmore will do some manual flying, test emergency scenarios like losing communications or power, and do a lot of debriefing to ensure that future Starliner crews know what to expect.\n\nIf all goes well on CFT, Starliner will carry its first astronaut crew for about six months to the ISS, perhaps as early as 2025. Starliner-1, that first operational flight, will carry NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Scott Tingle along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Josh Kutryk. The Starliner-1 crew is already deep in training, and Fincke served as backup for CFT as well.\n\nRelated: The ISS has a urine pump problem. Boeing's Starliner will flush it out.\n\nCommercial crew's genesis extends back to the commercial cargo program, which was first funded in 2006, as NASA used similar models to get private robotic and crewed vehicles running to the ISS. Until then, only government programs had sent supplies to the orbiting lab; agency officials turned to industry to nurture those companies' independence and resilience while, ideally, saving on taxpayer cost.\n\nCommercial cargo nurtured the development of SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus vehicle, both of which have been flying robotic resupply missions to the ISS for more than a decade, and will soon send Sierra Space's Dream Chaser to space as well. The success of cargo development helped NASA award its first commercial crew contracts in 2010, collectively totaling $50 million (worth about $72 million in 2024 dollars) to five companies.\n\nThe quintet included Blue Origin, Boeing, Paragon Space Development Corp., Sierra Nevada (now Sierra Space) and ULA, each of which received support under CCDev-1 (Commercial Crew Development-1) for several human spaceflight technologies. ULA's funding helped certify the Atlas V for human missions.\n\nRelated: I flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators. Here's what I learned (video, photos)\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, several new rounds of commercial crew funding brought extra support to Boeing, SpaceX and a range of other companies. CCDev-2, announced in April 2011, awarded a total of $270 million to Blue Origin, Boeing, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX. (Boeing got $92 million in this round for Starliner, while SpaceX's $75 million went toward the development of Crew Dragon.)\n\nThe funding increased with Commercial Crew integrated Capability (CCiCap) in August 2012, as NASA also narrowed the field to three companies: Sierra Nevada received $212 million for Dream Chaser, while Boeing and SpaceX got $460 million and $440 million, respectively.\n\nSpaceX and Boeing then received the last major contract for final development work, known as Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap), in September 2014. Boeing's deal was worth $4.2 billion back then, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. The money was also meant to cover six operational crewed flights to and from the ISS.\n\nAs is common with big spaceflight projects, lots of logistical and technical obstacles arose for both companies' spacecraft. NASA wanted the two CCtCap awardees to fly astronauts in 2017, but SpaceX's first such test flight launched in 2020, while Boeing's was delayed even longer, until today.\n\nLots of things contributed to the wait. Congress repeatedly gave less money than the White House and NASA requested for commercial crew, and technical obstacles arose. Boeing's solutions, however, took more flights and more time than SpaceX's.\n\nSpaceX has sent 12 crewed missions to the ISS to date, including the 63-day Demo-2 test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley in 2020. Their mission had been expected to launch in 2019, shortly after an uncrewed Crew Dragon successfully reached the ISS for the first time that March. But only a month later, that Dragon exploded during a ground test of its launch-abort system. SpaceX, as one would expect, put off human launches until it could address the mishap cause, which turned out to be a faulty valve.\n\nStarliner's issues were more complex. Its own first uncrewed mission, called Orbital Flight Test (OFT), never reached the ISS as planned in December 2019. The capsule's timing system got confused, and Starliner became stuck in an orbit that made it impossible to rendezvous with its destination. The investigation was complex and lengthy, requiring dozens of fixes, and the pandemic's arrival in early 2020 further delayed schedules due to supply chain problems and social distancing requirements.\n\nStarliner's next uncrewed flight met up with the ISS flawlessly in May 2022, but its road to crewed flights faced another obstacle in 2023. Late in CFT's training flow, new issues with the spacecraft were discovered, requiring extra fixes ahead of flight. The most pressing concerned the main parachutes (which carried less load than engineers thought) and the capsule wiring (which, as it turned out, was largely wrapped in flammable P213 tape).\n\nThe CFT astronauts, and Boeing and NASA, have repeatedly said these issues are behind them, although new issues could arise during CFT. Wilmore has also downplayed CFT as being the one thing determining Starliner's success; he frames all stages of development for astronauts as \"vitally important.\"\n\n\"This is human spaceflight,\" Wilmore explained to reporters in a livestreamed press conference on April 25, when he and Williams arrived at KSC for quarantine, training and launch preparations ahead of the May 6 attempt. \"You know that adage you've heard since Apollo 13: failure is not an option. And that has nothing specifically to do with Boeing or this program. That's all things that we do in human spaceflight.\"\n\nIn addition, a failure of a parachute to fully open during Blue Origin's recent NS-25 suborbital crewed launch prompted Boeing to double-check Starliner's own parachute systems.\n\n\"Starliner uses some similar components to [the New Shepard] parachute system,\" Stich explained during the May 31 briefing. According to Stich, Blue Origin provided NS-25 flight data with NASA, SpaceX and Boeing, allowing engineers to ensure the functionality of specific components. And, after examining the data, Stich said it was determined Starliner was \"good to go fly.\"\n\nRelated: 1st Boeing Starliner astronauts are ready to launch to the ISS for NASA (exclusive)\n\nWith the ISS expected to continue flying until at least 2030, the plan going forward is for three different spacecraft to carry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Aside from Dragon and Starliner, Russia will continue to send cosmonaut-led crews using its Soyuz spacecraft until at least 2028, when the nation's commitment to the partnership is scheduled to expire.\n\nSome NASA astronauts continue to use Soyuz for policy reasons, and also because the space station partners want as many backups as possible in case of technical problems with any one spacecraft.\n\nAs for private Starliner astronaut missions aside from NASA obligations for ISS, Boeing officials have said repeatedly that they want to focus on fulfilling their NASA contract first.\n\nIn the May 31 briefing, Fincke said that CFT \"will help continue the certification process for Starliner, so that Starliner 1, 2, 3, to infinity and beyond, can fly and provide services to the International Space Station, and it's up to Boeing, but other other missions available out there too.\"\n\nBesides that, CFT \"really is all of our attention at this point,\" Mark Nappi, Boeing's commercial crew program manager, told reporters on April 25. With at least six more years of ISS flights to plan for, \"we've got plenty of time to think about what's after that,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_howell@space.com", "name": "Elizabeth Howell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "josh_dinner@space.com", "name": "Josh Dinner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Nevada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northrop Grumman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

ULA is known for the Atlas V and the recently retired Delta IV Heavy rockets and the new Vulcan rockets.\n\nBoeing stated that its Starliner is conceived for up to 10 missions and each one is made for a specific assignment.\n\nThe spacecraft has only performed two missions, both uncrewed. The first Orbital Flight Test in December 2019, which did launch as planned but there was a glitch in the mission-elapsed timer that caused the spacecraft to go into an orbital insertion burn at the wrong time, which wasted a lot of fuel.\n\nSo, while it reached a stable orbit, it could not meet up the ISS.\n\nThe first Orbital Flight Test\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Starliner is the same one used for his maiden crewed mission. And it was christen Calypso after Jacques-Yves Cousteau's oceanography vessel, RV Calypso, stated NASA.\n\nIn May 2022, the second Orbital Flight Test was successful and made it to the famed floating laboratory.\n\nAfter the stage separation, the Atlas V booster will fall into the ocean. Unlike SpaceX rockets, Atlas rockets do not land.\n\nThe Atlas V rocket, with the Starliner on top, stands at 171 feet (52 meters) tall. It is a bit smaller than a stacked SpaceX Falcon rocket at 229.6 feet (70 meters).\n\nAfter the liftoff, it will be a more than 24-hour journey for Wilmore and Williams to reach the International Space Station, where Calypso will dock on the space station\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Harmony module.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, it should dock autonomously at 12:15 p.m., Thursday, June 6, according to Siceloff.\n\nThe mission has many objectives, but one of the main ones is to prove the Starliner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to launch and land.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The CFT crew is focused on testing Starliner systems in detail throughout their stay on ISS.

They are qualified to do so, but for this mission, the flight testing elements have priority,\u00e2\u20ac according to Siceloff in an earlier interview.\n\nThe pair will assess the spacecraft, its displays, and cargo transfer systems; and will even go inside Starliner and close the hatch to show it can be used as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe haven\u00e2\u20ac in case there is an emergency, NASA explained.\n\nDuring the first launch effort, former NASA astronaut and former Boeing CST-100 Starliner Director of Crew and Mission Systems Christopher J. Ferguson explained to Spectrum News what Wilmore and Williams will experience as the Starliner launches.\n\nThis mission is part of NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commercial Crew Program, which is designed to work with American aerospace companies to build spacecraft and rockets to send equipment, technology and astronauts from American soil.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The goal of the program is to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation on space station missions, which will allow for additional research time,\u00e2\u20ac NASA stated.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 2014, Boeing was awarded up to $4.2 billion by NASA to build, test and fly the Starliner. The contract includes six service missions, as well as an uncrewed and a crewed flight test to the ISS,\u00e2\u20ac Boeing stated in a 51-page document.\n\nBoth Wilmore and Williams will be at the ISS as part-time Expedition 71 members for about a week or before they return to Earth in the Starliner, NASA officials stated.\n\n(ISS expeditions are missions that can last about six months.)\n\nThe Starliner will have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard landing\u00e2\u20ac in the American Southwest as its parachutes will slow it down to 4 mph before touching soil again. The exact location has not yet been disclosed.\n\nWhen it comes to space travel, the Starliner crew are pros. Wilmore, the commander of the Crew Flight Test mission, became a NASA astronaut in July 2000.\n\nThe retired Navy veteran has been on the Atlantis shuttle mission STS-129 in 2009 and two ISS Expedition missions: 41 and 42 between 2014 and 2015.\n\nWilliams will be the pilot for this first voyage of the crewed mission. The Ohio native was selected to be a NASA astronaut in 1998 and has been on two ISS missions: Expeditions 14 and 15 in 2006 and 2007. And then 32 and 33 in 2012.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Williams, who has spent a 322 total days in space, ranks sixth on the all-time U.S. endurance list, and second all-time for a female astronaut,\u00e2\u20ac Boeing stated of the former retired Navy test pilot and captain.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [],

Docking manoeuvres with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been Nasa's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May six countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapor as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe Atlas V upper stage separated from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own in space, Starliner will ascend deeper into space and fire its onboard thrusters to plug itself into orbit and kick off its 24-hour catch-up with the ISS.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran Nasa astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than US$1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe longtime Nasa contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts towards the Moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner programme.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for Nasa. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft - seeded with Nasa funding - designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit and the Moon under the US space agency's Artemis programme.\n\nStarliner would compete head-to-head with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been Nasa's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the capsule will arrive at the ISS on Thursday and dock with the orbiting research outpost some 400 km above Earth.\n\nAlthough Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, the crew can assume control of the spacecraft if necessary. The test flight calls for Wilmore and Williams to practice manoeuvring the vehicle manually en route to the space station, where it will remain docked for at least eight days before returning to Earth.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding the capsule back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed Nasa mission.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its US$4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with Nasa, which wants the redundancy of having two different US rides to the ISS, an outpost expected to retire around 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's fourth test launch of its Starship rocket system, another chapter in its quest to build a reusable satellite launcher and Moon lander, is due for liftoff on Thursday from Texas.

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

"Liftoff, finally: Boeing Starliner launches first crew on third try", "body": "The Boeing Starliner capsule blasted off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket at 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida\n\nBoeing on Wednesday launched its very first astronauts bound for the International Space Station aboard a Starliner capsule, which joins a select club of spacecraft to carry humans beyond Earth.\n\nThe third time turned out to be the charm for the aerospace giant, after two previous bids to fly with crew were aborted late into the countdown, for technical reasons.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both of whom have two previous spaceflights under their belts, blasted off at 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the station.\n\n\"Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you,\" Wilmore, who is commander of the test flight, said just before liftoff. \"Let's put some fire in this rocket, and let's push it to the heavens.\"\n\nStarliner becomes just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\nThe Starliner program has been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission will offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n- Embarrassing setbacks -\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nMore from this section Newburgh business owners: Cashless parking meters are driving away customers Policing Minister: Voters can take our promise of a reduction in migration 'to the bank' LS Polls 2024 Results: Shashi Tharoor Celebrates Big Win In Thiruvananthapuram, Distribute Sweets\n\nThe first crewed launch attempt on May 6 was scuppered in the final hours due to a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket the capsule sits atop.\n\nThen on Saturday, things were even more dramatic with liftoff aborted with less than four minutes left on the countdown clock as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nIn both cases, Wilmore and Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the first crewed launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nThe astronauts will now be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, they will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nia/des", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gianrigo_marletta@reformer.com", "name": "Gianrigo Marletta", "type":

That mission was a partial failure as it was not able to rendezvous with the ISS forcing a 2 1/2-year delay to Boeing's program to remedy hardware, software and management issues. The second uncrewed test flight in 2022 made it to the ISS, but post-launch review and preparation for the CFT brought further delays with more hardware issues popping up.\n\nBut half a decade later, Williams and Wilmore were set to fly, entering quarantine on April 22. Finally, on May 6, they tried for the first time to take off from the Space Coast, but an issue with a fluttering valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage scrubbed that attempt with about two hours to go on the countdown clock. Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" said NASA astronaut for future Starliner crew member Mike Fincke during NASA's live commentary leading up to launch. \"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nIn the end, the third attempt went smoothly.\n\n\"Everything was fine. No hiccups, no drama and nothing to worry about,\" Fincke said. \"So I was really happy for Butch and Suni and happy with the whole team. ... Now we just got to get to space station.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building venturing out after 7:30 a.m. to climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral and make their way back on board the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nBefore driving over, they played a traditional prelaunch game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba -- this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The idea is that losing that game is the worst thing that happens on a launch day.\n\n\"Speaking as a child of the 70s, a lot of us watched \"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood\" and Mr. Rogers would tell us to take our time to do it right, and that's what we're doing here,\" Fincke said.\n\nJust before 9 a.m., teams waited the conclusion of a weather brief before moving forward with hatch closure, but were given the go for hatch closure with less than two hours to go before launch.\n\n\"We are ready.

The spacecraft, carrying astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams, lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:52 a.m. ET on Wednesday. This mission, crucial for Boeing and NASA, faced numerous technical issues that postponed its original schedule. The launch proceeded smoothly, with Starliner completing an orbital-insertion burn about 30 minutes into the flight, setting it on course to reach the International Space Station (ISS) on Thursday.\n\nThis mission serves as a final test before Starliner can be certified to regularly transport NASA crews to and from the ISS. Initial plans for the mission were delayed due to problems with the United Launch Alliance-built Atlas V booster rocket and the Starliner itself, including a helium leak and a glitch in a ground system. These issues were resolved, allowing the launch to proceed. NASA has emphasized the importance of identifying and rectifying such technical problems on the ground to ensure mission safety.\n\nBoeing has been working on the Starliner project since 2014, alongside SpaceX, which has already successfully completed multiple missions for NASA. Boeing's journey with Starliner has been fraught with challenges, including software coding problems and valve issues, leading to $1.4 billion in accounting losses. Successful completion of this mission would bring Boeing closer to fulfilling its contract with NASA, allowing it to conduct six more crewed missions to the ISS.\n\nBoeing's efforts to overcome the technical hurdles and ensure the spacecraft's readiness highlight the complexities of space missions. The successful launch marks a significant milestone for the company, reaffirming its role in US space exploration. The upcoming docking with the ISS and the astronauts' stay will be closely monitored, with the aim of securing NASA's certification for future missions. This milestone also underscores the competitive landscape between Boeing and SpaceX in the realm of commercial spaceflight.", "source": {"uri": "quiverquant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "quiverquant.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

That mission was a partial failure as it was not able to rendezvous with the ISS forcing a 2\u00bd-year delay to Boeing's program to remedy hardware, software and management issues. The second uncrewed test flight in 2022 made it to the ISS, but post-launch review and preparation for the CFT brought further delays with more hardware issues popping up.\n\nBut half a decade later, Williams and Wilmore were set to fly, entering quarantine on April 22. Finally, on May 6, they tried for the first time to take off from the Space Coast, but an issue with a fluttering valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage scrubbed that attempt with about two hours to go on the countdown clock. Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" said NASA astronaut for future Starliner crew member Mike Fincke during NASA's live commentary leading up to launch. \"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nIn the end, the third attempt went smoothly.\n\n\"Everything was fine. No hiccups, no drama and nothing to worry about,\" Fincke said. \"So I was really happy for Butch and Suni and happy with the whole team. ... Now we just got to get to space station.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building venturing out after 7:30 a.m. to climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral and make their way back on board the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nBefore driving over, they played a traditional prelaunch game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba -- this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The idea is that losing that game is the worst thing that happens on a launch day.\n\n\"Speaking as a child of the '70s, a lot of us watched \"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood\" and Mr. Rogers would tell us to take our time to do it right, and that's what we're doing here,\" Fincke said.\n\nJust before 9 a.m., teams waited the conclusion of a weather brief before moving forward with hatch closure, but were given the go for hatch closure with less than two hours to go before launch.\n\n\"We are ready. We're smiling out here, see you in a couple weeks,\" said Wilmore.\n\nThe astronauts will spend just over 25 hours making their way to the ISS set to dock Thursday at 12:15 p.m., where they will spend about eight days on board before returning to Earth for a landing in one of five locations in the desert in the southwestern United States.\n\nIf successful, this will be the final required mission for Boeing under NASA's Commercial Crew Program to achieve certification and set up regular rotational missions to the ISS, sharing duties with SpaceX.\n\n\"We need that access,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free. \"So right now we have we have one provider giving us that access to the space station.

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams entered the Starliner capsule and completed necessary checks by 10:08AM ET. Less than 30 minutes after the astronauts entered the capsule, the CEO ULA tweeted that the company was \"working an issue with topping valves on the ground side\" and that it was running the fix through its Software Integration Lab (SIL) before it's executed. In the end, ULA was able to implement a workaround, and the spacecraft lifted off at 10:52am ET.\n\nBack on May 6, the companies scrubbed the flight two hours after it was originally scheduled to launch after their ground teams detected \"anomalous behavior by the pressure regulation valve in the liquid oxygen tank of the Centaur upper stage of the ULA Atlas V launch vehicle.\" The valve was replaced and the Starliner teams were ready to make another launch attempt when they encountered another issue: They found a \"small helium leak\" in the spacecraft's service module.\n\nNASA and Boeing had to push back Starliner's launch date in order to investigate the leak and figure out how it would affect the flight. They eventually determined that it didn't pose a threat to the mission's safety, so they scheduled a launch attempt for June 1. Last week's launch was also scrubbed last minute due to the \"computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count.\"\n\nAside from the NASA astronauts, Starliner flew with 760 pounds of cargo, including 300 pounds of food and other supplies requested by the crew that's currently onboard the International Space Station. Wilmore and Williams will spend eight days on the ISS conducting tests to help determine whether the Starliner is ready for regular flights to the orbiting laboratory.

This mission will mark the first time that the commercially made capsule will carry humans. It is anticipated that the capsule will arrive at the station at about 12:15 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday night.\n\nThere were fewer than four minutes left on Saturday when the countdown was halted. A malfunction in the flight computers that are responsible for controlling launch was the root cause.\n\nIn preparation for the mission scheduled for Wednesday, the launch corporation, United Launch Alliance (ULA), changed a power supply on the system. This comes after an effort to launch the Atlas V rocket was unsuccessful a month ago due to a valve that was malfunctioning on the Centaur, which is the upper stage of the rocket.\n\nWith the Space Shuttle's retirement in 2011, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) established a cooperation with two commercial companies, Boeing and SpaceX, to transport people to and from the International Space Station.\n\nNevertheless, Boeing has fallen behind SpaceX, which has now successfully completed nine missions for NASA and four flights for private companies.\n\nNASA and Boeing were under the impression that a re-launch in 2022 would be successful; however, it was later discovered that there were issues with the capsule's parachute systems.\n\nAdditionally, the tape that was utilized to manage the hundreds of feet of cable that was contained within the spaceship was found to be combustible during the examination. These issues were resolved by Boeing, and the company was able to obtain NASA's authorization to launch the crew.\n\nThe initial attempt to launch this crewed mission that had been scheduled for the previous month was canceled due to a difficulty that had arisen with the rocket that was responsible for sending Starliner into space.\n\nIn the event that Starliner docks with the space station, Willmore and Williams will conduct tests on the essential systems of the spacecraft, which will include communication and life support. In spite of the fact that the spacecraft is capable of effectively flying itself, the two will experiment with human controls when it gets closer to the orbiting base.\n\nIt is anticipated that the crew will remain on the station for approximately one week before landing in the southwest region of the United States using parachutes as a cover. A review of the flight data will be conducted by teams from NASA and Boeing prior to the vehicle being certified for operational flying missions.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to divide astronaut flights between Boeing and SpaceX, with SpaceX going to the International Space Station approximately once every six months.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Starliner-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The automatic abort was triggered by the ground launch sequencer (GLS) computer just 3 minutes and 50 seconds before the scheduled launch, leaving the exact cause unclear. The incident occurred when Boeing's Starliner together with its Atlas V rocket was to ferry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida to the International Space Station (ISS) at 12:25 p.m. EDT (1625 GMT). Despite disappointment, Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, held onto his resolve and underscored safety as a top priority for the situation along with the need for a comprehensive investigation.\n\nThere was a decision made by NASA, Boeing, and United Launch Alliance (ULA). They abandoned the possibility of using a window on June 2nd to conduct a detailed examination of the issue. The delay was detailed in a NASA update where it pointed out that the issue is about a likely bad computer card that controls ground systems at Space Launch Complex-41. Tory Bruno, who is the CEO of ULA, had this to say concerning troubleshooting: it would necessitate the removal of fuel from the rocket before engineers can take it apart and ensure an appropriate safe distance for personnel.\n\nWhile the team aims to resolve the issue swiftly, backup launch dates on June 5 and June 6 have been identified. If more time is needed, a 10-day stand-down might be necessary for vehicle battery replacements.\n\nA successful launch on June 5 would occur at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 GMT), with a NASA webcast starting four hours earlier. The Starliner mission, under a $4.2 billion contract with NASA's Commercial Crew Program, has faced multiple delays over recent years, including a scrubbed launch on May 6 due to issues with the Atlas Centaur upper stage valves. Despite resolving various pre-launch glitches, the mission now awaits another attempt to make its historic crewed flight.", "source": {"uri": "wonderfulengineering.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonderful Engineering"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaheer_shahzad@wonderfulengineering.com", "name": "Shaheer Shahzad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory_Bruno", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory Bruno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas-Centaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas-Centaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "dateEnd": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1492, "textEnd": 1509}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 127, "textEnd": 133}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 179, "textEnd": 185, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 966, "textEnd": 974}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1917, "textEnd": 1922}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

A veteran of two spaceflights, Wilmore has 178 days in space under his belt. In 2009, he served as a pilot aboard space shuttle Atlantis for the STS-129 mission. Additionally, Wilmore served as a flight engineer for Expedition 41 until November 2014, when he assumed command of the space station after arrival of the Expedition 42 crew. He returned to Earth the following March. Prior to his selection by NASA in 2000, the father of two obtained both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, before graduating with another master's degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, and has completed four operational deployments during his tenure as a fleet naval officer and aviator.\n\nWilliams is the spacecraft pilot for the flight test. Williams has spent 322 days in space across two missions: Expedition 14/15 in 2006 through 2007, and Expedition 32/33 in 2012. The Massachusetts native also conducted seven spacewalks, totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes. Before her career began with NASA in 1998, Williams graduated with her bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, before obtaining her master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. In total, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program has delivered on its goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station from the United States through a partnership with American private industry. This partnership is changing the arc of human spaceflight history by opening access to low Earth orbit and the space station to more people, science, and commercial opportunities. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in space exploration, including future missions to the Moon under Artemis and, eventually, Mars.\n\nLearn more about NASA's Commercial Crew program at:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/commercialcrew\n\n-end-\n\nJosh Finch / Jimi Russell / Claire O'SheaHeadquarters, Washington202-358-1100joshua.a.finch@nasa.gov / james.j.russell@nasa.gov / claire.a.o'shea@nasa.gov\n\nSteven Siceloff / Danielle Sempsrott / Stephanie PlucinskyKennedy Space Center, Florida321-867-2468steven.p.siceloff@nasa.gov / danielle.c.sempsrott@nasa.gov / stephanie.n.plucinsky@nasa.gov\n\nLeah CheshierJohnson Space Center, Houston281-483-5111leah.d.cheshier@nasa.gov", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher C.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams entered the Starliner capsule and completed necessary checks by 10:08AM ET. Less than 30 minutes after the astronauts entered the capsule, the CEO ULA tweeted that the company was \"working an issue with topping valves on the ground side\" and that it was running the fix through its Software Integration Lab (SIL) before it's executed. In the end, ULA was able to implement a workaround, and the spacecraft lifted off at 10:52am ET.\n\nBack on May 6, the companies scrubbed the flight two hours after it was originally scheduled to launch after their ground teams detected \"anomalous behavior by the pressure regulation valve in the liquid oxygen tank of the Centaur upper stage of the ULA Atlas V launch vehicle.\" The valve was replaced and the Starliner teams were ready to make another launch attempt when they encountered another issue: They found a \"small helium leak\" in the spacecraft's service module.\n\nThe astronauts are beginning ingress into #Starliner -- taking their seats in the spacecraft. Teams will assist in a series of checks, including umbilical hook ups, communications checks and suit checks. The astronauts will also check the spacecraft so they are ready for flight. pic.twitter.com/aGfZoq9oPd\n\nNASA and Boeing had to push back Starliner's launch date in order to investigate the leak and figure out how it would affect the flight. They eventually determined that it didn't pose a threat to the mission's safety, so they scheduled a launch attempt for June 1. Last week's launch was also scrubbed last minute due to the \"computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count.\"\n\nAside from the NASA astronauts, Starliner flew with 760 pounds of cargo, including 300 pounds of food and other supplies requested by the crew that's currently onboard the International Space Station. Wilmore and Williams will spend eight days on the ISS conducting tests to help determine whether the Starliner is ready for regular flights to the orbiting laboratory. NASA said that if the mission is completed successfully, it will begin the final process of \"certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station.\"\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source": {"uri": "brudirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BruneiDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umbilical cable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 10}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 765, "textEnd": 770}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1797, "textEnd": 1803}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

If liftoff does not occur on Wednesday, there is another opportunity at 10:29 a.m. ET Thursday, according to NASA.The mission, known as the Crew Flight Test, is the culmination of Boeing's efforts to develop a spacecraft to rival SpaceX's prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand the United States' options for ferrying astronauts to the space station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.

Meanwhile, Boeing's competitor under NASA's Commercial Crew program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.This mission could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing's Starliner spacecraft ready for routine operations to deliver astronauts and cargo to the space station.Weeks of troubleshootingA number of issues caused the previous crewed launch attempts, on May 6 and June 1, to be scrubbed.Two hours prior to the launch attempt on May 6, engineers identified an issue with a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket, which was built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The entire stack, including the rocket and spacecraft, was rolled back from the launchpad for testing and repairs.Teams also worked through a small helium leak within the spacecraft service module, a \"design vulnerability\" in the propulsion system and assessed the parachutes for the Starliner capsule.Starliner was just 3 minutes and 50 seconds from liftoff Saturday afternoon, when an automatic hold was triggered by the ground launch sequencer, or the computer that launches the rocket.United Launch Alliance technicians and engineers assessed the ground support equipment over the weekend, examining three large computers housed inside a shelter at the base of the launchpad. Each computer is the same, providing triple redundancy to ensure the safe launch of crewed missions.\"Imagine a large rack that is a big computer where the functions of the computer as a controller are broken up separately into individual cards or printed wire circuit boards,\" said Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United Launch Alliance, during a Saturday news conference. \"They're all stand-alone, but together, it's an integrated controller.\"The cards within the computers are responsible for different key systems that must occur before a launch, such as releasing bolts at the rocket's base so it can lift off after ignition.During the final four minutes before launch, all three computers must communicate and agree with one another. But during Saturday's countdown, a card on one of the computers was six seconds slower in responding than the other two computers, indicating that something was not correct and triggering an automatic hold, according to Bruno.Over the weekend, engineers evaluated the computers, their power supply and network communications between the computers. The team isolated the issue to a single ground power supply within one of the computers, which provides power to the computer cards responsible for key countdown events -- including the replenishment valves for the rocket's upper stage, which also caused an issue during the countdown, according to an update shared by NASA.Starliner teams reported no signs of physical damage to the computer, which they removed and replaced with a spare. The other computers and their cards were also assessed, and all of them are performing normally as expected, according to the ULA team.Top headlines:\n\nBoeing's Starliner mission will make a third attempt at launching its first crewed flight test Wednesday in a milestone that has been a decade in the making.\n\nThe new spacecraft's maiden voyage with humans on board is on track to lift off atop an Atlas V rocket at 10:52 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe historic event will stream live on NASA's website, and coverage began at 6:45 a.m. ET.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are set to ride aboard the Starliner capsule on a journey that takes them to the International Space Station.\n\nWeather conditions are 90% favorable for a Wednesday morning launch, with the only concern being cumulus clouds, according to the US Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron.

launches first crew on third try", "body": "Cape Canaveral (AFP) - Boeing on Wednesday launched its very first astronauts bound for the International Space Station aboard a Starliner capsule, which joins a select club of spacecraft to carry humans beyond Earth.\n\nThe third time turned out to be the charm for the aerospace giant, after two previous bids to fly with crew were aborted late into the countdown, for technical reasons.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both of whom have two previous spaceflights under their belts, blasted off at 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the station.\n\n\"Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you,\" Wilmore, who is commander of the test flight, said just before liftoff. \"Let's put some fire in this rocket, and let's push it to the heavens.\"\n\nStarliner becomes just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\nThe Starliner program has been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission will offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\nEmbarrassing setbacks\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nThe first crewed launch attempt on May 6 was scuppered in the final hours due to a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket the capsule sits atop.\n\nThen on Saturday, things were even more dramatic with liftoff aborted with less than four minutes left on the countdown clock as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nIn both cases, Wilmore and Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the first crewed launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nThe astronauts will now be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, they will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"},

Accompanied by colleague Butch Wilmore, she embarked on a 25-hour flight to the International Space Station, lifting off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida after several delays.\n\nAt 58, Williams serves as the pilot for the flight test, while 61-year-old Wilmore commands the mission. This launch signifies the commencement of the NASA-Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test (CFT), according to Boeing.\n\n\"This crew flight test represents the beginning of a new era of space exploration as we watch astronauts Wilmore and Williams put Boeing's Starliner through its paces on the way to the International Space Station,\" said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Ted Colbert.\n\n\"This is a great start. We look forward to getting the astronauts safely to the space station and back home,\" Colbert said in a press release.\n\nElon Musk took to X, formerly Twitter to congratulate the team. \"Congratulations on a successful launch!\" he wrote.\n\nWilmore and Williams are pioneering not only as the first to launch on an Atlas V rocket but also as the first to experience microgravity aboard it en route to the space station. They will execute various flight test objectives, including manually piloting Starliner.\n\nAccompanying the crew, Starliner carries approximately 760 pounds (345 kilograms) of cargo. Upon docking with the ISS, Wilmore and Williams will spend about a week on the station before returning to Earth. A successful CFT will pave the way for Boeing and NASA to certify Starliner for extended operational missions to the ISS.\n\nWilliams, in addition to her historic launch, is renowned for other groundbreaking achievements. In 2012, during a previous stint aboard the ISS, she became the first woman to complete a triathlon in space, simulating swimming using a weight-lifting machine and running on a treadmill while secured by a harness. This followed her notable feat of running the Boston Marathon from the space station in 2007.\n\nWilliams earned her commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy from the United States Naval Academy in May 1987. Selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998, she boasts a distinguished career, having participated in two space missions: Expeditions 14/15 in 2006 and 32/33 in 2012.\n\nDuring her tenure, Williams served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and later assumed the role of commander for Expedition 33.\n\nBoeing's Crew Flight Test mission faced multiple delays due to setbacks in the spacecraft's development, prolonging its launch for several years. The recent attempt was hindered by last-minute computer issues, leading to the cancellation of Saturday's launch. This setback adds to a series of delays experienced throughout the mission's development, including a previous postponement on May 6 for leak checks and rocket repairs.\n\nDespite the challenges, Boeing has now joined SpaceX as the second private company capable of providing crew transportation to and from the ISS.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That mission was a partial failure as it was not able to rendezvous with the ISS forcing a 2 1/2-year delay to Boeing's program to remedy hardware, software and management issues. The second uncrewed test flight in 2022 made it to the ISS, but post-launch review and preparation for the CFT brought further delays with more hardware issues popping up.\n\nBut half a decade later, Williams and Wilmore were set to fly, entering quarantine on April 22. Finally, on May 6, they tried for the first time to take off from the Space Coast, but an issue with a fluttering valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage scrubbed that attempt with about two hours to go on the countdown clock. Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" said NASA astronaut for future Starliner crew member Mike Fincke during NASA's live commentary leading up to launch. \"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building venturing out after 7:30 a.m. to climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral and make their way back on board the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nBefore driving over, they played a traditional prelaunch game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba -- this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The idea is that losing that game is the worst thing that happens on a launch day.\n\n\"Speaking as a child of the 70s, a lot of us watched \"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood\" and Mr. Rogers would tell us to take our time to do it right, and that's what we're doing here,\" Fincke said.\n\nJust before 9 a.m., teams waited the conclusion of a weather brief before moving forward with hatch closure, but were given the go for hatch closure with less than two hours to go before launch.\n\n\"We are ready. We're smiling out here, see you in a couple weeks,\" said Wilmore.\n\nIf they manage to lift off, the astronauts will spend just over 25 hours making their way to the ISS where they will spend about eight days on board before returning to Earth for a landing in one of five locations in the desert in the southwestern United States.\n\n\"Today is a great day to put on a spacesuit and climb into a spacecraft and go launch,\" Fincke said.\n\nIf successful, this will be the final required mission for Boeing under NASA's Commercial Crew Program to achieve certification and set up regular rotational missions to the ISS, sharing duties with SpaceX.\n\n\"We need that access,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free. \"So right now we have we have one provider giving us that access to the space station. This will give us a second provider, which means if we have a problem with either, we have ways to get our crews to and from station, which helps keep the tempo that we've had for 23 years of having humans in low-Earth orbit, but also that opportunity to get the crews back if there's an issue at all and keep that presence going.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams will spend time on both the way up and down from the ISS testing out manual control overrides among other facets of the mostly automated spacecraft.\n\n\"There's a thought of how things should be, but then there's the reality how things need to be,\" said Wilmore ahead of the launch attempt. \"That's what this test is all -- everything we do is test. It's been a process over the years that is such a benefit in all aspects of the capabilities of this spacecraft, and we're excited to be a part of it.\"\n\nThe pair are former Navy test pilots and veterans of two spaceflight each, with both having traveled on board Russia Soyuz capsules as well as the space shuttle. Wilmore is commander and joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2000 while Williams joined in 1998.\n\nWilliams was given the honor to name the capsule after it landed, and dubbed it Calypso, in deference to oceanographer Jacques Cousteau'sfamed vessel. The zero-gravity indicator for the mission follows the maritime theme, a stuffed narwhal that is also named Calypso.\n\nThe flight comes just over four years since SpaceX made its first crewed flight to the ISS with its Crew Dragon spacecraft, which has since flown 13 times carrying 50 humans to space. That includes the four members of Crew-8 awaiting along with the rest of the seven-person crew of Expedition 71 aboard the ISS.\n\nISS crew members Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson recorded a message for Williams and Wilmore ahead of their last attempt to launch this past Saturday.\n\n\"We can't wait for you guys to join us here on station,\" Dyson said. \"We'll be monitoring your every move on the journey and we'll be waiting to open the hatch and welcome you to your home away from home.\"\n\n\"We know you've waited a while to get your ride aboard Starliner, but we know it will have been worth every minute,\" Epps added. \"So from all of us on the International Space Station, godspeed and we'll see you soon.\"\n\nStarliner is only the sixth ever U.S.-based spacecraft to fly with NASA astronauts following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttleand SpaceX's Crew Dragon. Williams is the first woman to fly on an orbital test flight among NASA's spacecraft.\n\nIt also marks a return of human launches from Cape Canaveral's launch pads, which last saw a crewed flight in 1968 with the launch of Apollo7. Every Apollo mission afterward as well as the space shuttle and Crew Dragon launches have come from nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt's the first time an Atlas V will fly with humans as well, although earlier iterations of the Atlas rocket flew several human spaceflights in the early 1960s including John Glenn's historic trip to space as the first American to each orbit in 1962. This also marks the 100th launch of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nStarliner will also become the first U.S.-based capsule to make a land touchdown as Crew Dragon, Apollo, Gemini and Mercury all made waterlandings, as will the Artemis program's Orion capsule that has yet to fly with humans. Russia's Soyuz, though, features land touchdowns.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Acaba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph M.

It should rendezvous with the research lab at 12:15 pm (1615 GMT) Sunday to begin a roughly one-week stay.\n\n\"Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you,\" Wilmore, who is commander of the test flight, said just before liftoff. \"Let's put some fire in this rocket, and let's push it to the heavens.\"\n\nStarliner becomes just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\n\"This is another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA,\" the space agency's chief Bill Nelson told reporters.\n\n\"And I want to give my personal congratulations to the whole team that went through a lot of trial and tribulation. But they had perseverance. And that's what we do at NASA, we don't launch until it's right.\"\n\n- Boeing looks to turn a corner -\n\nA successful mission will help dispel the bitter taste left by years of safety scares and delays, and provide Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\n\"I think about over the years how many bad headlines I read about the Shuttle program, about the International Space Station -- and I look back now at how successful they were,\" said Mark Nappi, Boeing's vice president and program manager of Commercial Crew Program.\n\n\"Someday, we'll be looking back at this program the same way.\"\n\nMore from this section Boba Fett Star Wars figure becomes world's most valuable vintage toy Labour's education policy is

to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nThe first crewed launch attempt on May 6 was scuppered in the final hours due to a buzzy valve on the Atlas V rocket the capsule is fixed atop.\n\nSaturday's launch attempt was even more dramatic, aborted with just minutes left on the countdown due to a ground launch computer issue.\n\n- Put to the test -\n\nEx-Navy test pilots Wilmore and Williams are now charged with probing Starliner \"from izzard to gizzard,\" in Nelson's words -- from piloting it manually, to tracking the stars around them to recover the spacecraft's orientation.\n\nDuring their stay on the orbital outpost, they will continue to evaluate the spacecraft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems.\n\nNASA's Steve Stich said teams were monitoring just one issue so far: excessive water use in a spacecraft cooling system called a sublimator, but expected there was enough in reserve for a safe return.\n\nAfter undocking from the

But the mission was called off minutes before launch due to technical issues.\n\nTechnicians and engineers with ULA worked overnight Saturday and on Sunday to assess the ground support equipment at the launch pad that encountered issues during the countdown and scrubbed the launch attempt, according to NASA.\n\nThe ULA team identified an issue with a single ground power supply within one of the three redundant chassis that provides power to a subset of computer cards controlling various system functions, including the card responsible for the stable replenishment topping valves for the Centaur upper stage.\n\nAll three of these chassis are required to enter the terminal phase of the launch countdown to ensure crew safety.\n\nThe team removed the chassis containing the faulty ground power unit on Sunday, and replaced with a spare chassis. No signs of physical damage were observed, said NASA.\n\nA full failure analysis of the power unit will be performed to better understand root cause.\n\nMeanwhile, ULA has completed functional checkouts of the new chassis and the cards, and all hardware is performing normally, according to NASA.\n\nThe flight test will carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS for about a week to test the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems before NASA certifies the transportation system for rotational missions to the orbiting laboratory for the agency's Commercial Crew Program, according to NASA. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_support_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ground support equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 19}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 130, "textEnd": 136}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

NASA will be airing a livestream of the launch.\n\nWeather is currently 90% favorable to launch. Derrol Nail of NASA Communications said during a livestream that the team is keeping an eye on the cumulus cloud forecast because if the rocket flies through cumulus clouds, it could create its own lightning strike.\n\nThe Starliner is designed to carry a seven-person crew, but the \"test drive\" launch will only carry NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a former U.S. Navy captain who will be commanding the flight, and Sunita Williams, 58, a former Navy service member who will be piloting the flight.\n\nWilmore and Williams entered the capsule around 8:00 a.m. ET, taking their seats and performing a series of checks including communications checks and suit checks, according to a post on X from Boeing Space.\n\nThis flight will be Wilmore's third mission to the ISS, NASA said during its Wednesday livestream. Williams is also on her third flight to space and will be the first woman on a test flight in an orbital spacecraft, according to NASA.\n\nAfter Starliner launches into orbit, it will be about a 24-hour journey to the ISS, during which the crew will test several flight objects, such as checking equipment, according to NASA.\n\nBoeing Space said Wilmore and Williams will pilot Starline manually at certain points to prove it can, despite the spacecraft being able to operate autonomously.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are expected to spend one week aboard the ISS and will be evaluating the spacecraft and its systems. Upon re-entry, the spacecraft will deploy parachutes and an airbag system, landing the pair in the western U.S.\n\nIt comes after the launch of Starliner was delayed several times. The crewed flight test was tentatively scheduled for May 6, but was scrubbed after a problem with an oxygen valve on the ULA rocket.\n\nA new launch date had been set for May 25, but a small helium leak was discovered in the service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating a spacecraft.\n\nAnother launch set for June 2 was scrubbed minutes before it was due to begin \"due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count.\"\n\nAfter Starliner launches into orbit, it will be about a 24-hour journey to the ISS, during which the crew will test several flight objects, such as checking equipment, according to NASA.\n\nIf the mission is successful, NASA could certify the spacecraft to perform routine missions to and from the ISS. NASA has primarily been using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport crew and cargo to the ISS.\n\nThe missions are part of the larger Commercial Crew Program at NASA, which uses American rockets and spacecraft to launch astronauts and cargo to the ISS with the hope of helping the federal space agency prepare for its upcoming moon and Mars missions.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cumulus cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryogenic fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human mission to Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6a06f9e9-28e3-4c17-9f36-f72b677f0d16/starliner-4-rt-gmh-240605_1717593411745_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2206, "textEnd": 2211}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2322, "textEnd": 2328}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 2491, "textEnd": 2497}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

launch attempt", "body": "Cape Canaveral (AFP) - Boeing will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\nEmbarrassing setbacks\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWhen they do fly, Wilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will carry out more tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type":

UrduPoint", "body": "Boeing will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station\n\nCape Canaveral, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Jun, 2024) Boeing will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the station.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

NASA will be airing a livestream of the launch.\n\nWeather is currently 90% favorable to launch. Derrol Nail of NASA Communications said during a livestream that the team is keeping an eye on the cumulus cloud forecast because if the rocket flies through cumulus clouds, it could create its own lightning strike.\n\nThe Starliner is designed to carry a seven-person crew, but the \"test drive\" launch will only carry NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a former U.S. Navy captain who will be commanding the flight, and Sunita Williams, 58, a former Navy service member who will be piloting the flight.\n\nWilmore and Williams entered the capsule around 8:00 a.m. ET, taking their seats and performing a series of checks including communications checks and suit checks, according to a post on X from Boeing Space.\n\nThis flight will be Wilmore's third mission to the ISS, NASA said during its Wednesday livestream. Williams is also on her third flight to space and will be the first woman on a test flight in an orbital spacecraft, according to NASA.\n\nAfter Starliner launches into orbit, it will be about a 24-hour journey to the ISS, during which the crew will test several flight objects, such as checking equipment, according to NASA.\n\nBoeing Space said Wilmore and Williams will pilot Starline manually at certain points to prove it can, despite the spacecraft being able to operate autonomously.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are expected to spend one week aboard the ISS and will be evaluating the spacecraft and its systems. Upon re-entry, the spacecraft will deploy parachutes and an airbag system, landing the pair in the western U.S.\n\nIt comes after the launch of Starliner was delayed several times. The crewed flight test was tentatively scheduled for May 6, but was scrubbed after a problem with an oxygen valve on the ULA rocket.\n\nA new launch date had been set for May 25, but a small helium leak was discovered in the service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating a spacecraft.\n\nAnother launch set for June 2 was scrubbed minutes before it was due to begin \"due to the computer ground launch sequencer not loading into the correct operational configuration after proceeding into terminal count.\"\n\nIf the mission is successful, NASA could certify the spacecraft to perform routine missions to and from the ISS. NASA has primarily been using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport crew and cargo to the ISS.\n\nThe missions are part of the larger Commercial Crew Program at NASA, which uses American rockets and spacecraft to launch astronauts and cargo to the ISS with the hope of helping the federal space agency prepare for its upcoming moon and Mars missions.", "source": {"uri": "mycentraloregon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyCentralOregon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cumulus cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryogenic fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human mission to Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2024/06/05144925/GettyImages-10077336970815.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2149, "textEnd": 2154}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 2265, "textEnd": 2271}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 2434, "textEnd": 2440}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It also marks the first crewed launch on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and the first crewed launch on an Atlas-family class rocket since Gordon Cooper on the last Mercury program flight aboard \"Faith 7\" in May 1963.\u202f\"", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35 Orlando"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevard_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brevard County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brevard County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury-Atlas 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox35orlando.com/www.fox35orlando.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/GettyImages-2155865059.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brevard County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

They had been training and quarantining in Houston while awaiting the opportunity to return to space.\n\nAmong Wilmore's accomplishments, he served as a pilot aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2009. The Tennessee native is also married and has two daughters, according to his NASA biography.\n\nWilliams, 58, joined NASA in 1998 and ranks second on the list of total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut, with 50 hours and 40 minutes, per NASA.\n\nThe launch was delayed two previous times: On Monday, May 6, the astronauts were strapped into the spacecraft and hours away from launch when the test flight was canceled because of an issue with the Atlas V rocket, which helps propel the vehicle, according to NBC News.\n\nWhile working to address the problem, a helium leak in the Starliner capsule's propulsion system was discovered, NASA reported.\n\nOn Saturday, June 1, the spacecraft was less than four minutes away from liftoff when the ground launch sequencer -- the computer that launches the rocket -- triggered an automatic hold.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from

And Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you. So with that, let's get going! Let's put some fire in this rocket and push it toward the heavens!\"\n\nHe got his wish.\n\nThe Atlas 5 dropped the Starliner off with a velocity just shy of what's required to reach orbit, a precaution to make sure the crew ship would re-enter and land safely even if a major problem knocked out its own propulsion system. But there were no problems, and a thruster firing 31 minutes after liftoff completed the ascent phase of the mission, putting the ship in the planned orbit.\n\nThe astronauts planned to test the Starliner's manual controls and then closely monitor an automated 25-hour rendezvous with the station, catching up from behind and below before moving in for docking at the lab's forward port just past noon Thursday.\n\nThe long-awaited flight marked the first launch of an Atlas 5 with astronauts aboard and the first for the Atlas family of rockets since astronaut Gordon Cooper took off just a few miles away on the Mercury program's final flight 61 years ago.\n\nIt also marks the first piloted flight of the Starliner, Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020.\n\nDespite a larger NASA contract, Boeing's Starliner is four years behind SpaceX getting astronauts to space. But Wilmore and Williams say the spacecraft is now safer and more capable thanks to numerous upgrades and fixes.\n\n\"I'm not going to say it's been easy. It's a little bit of (an) emotional roller coaster,\" Williams said before the crew's first launch attempt. But, she added, \"we knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"\n\nWhile Wilmore and Williams are closing in on the space station Thursday, SpaceX plans to launch its gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its fourth test flight from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, \"Starbase\" facility.\n\nThe booster will attempt a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico shortly after liftoff while the Starship upper stage continues into space, looping halfway around the planet before re-entry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn three previous flights, both stages were destroyed in flight, but performance dramatically improved with each launch as upgrades and fixes were implemented, and SpaceX expects more of the same with the fourth test flight.\n\nThe Super Heavy has nothing to do with Boeing's Starliner or the space station, but NASA will be paying close attention because the agency plans to use a variant of the Starship to carry astronauts down to the moon's surface in its Artemis program. Perfecting the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage are crucial to those plans.\n\nWilmore and Williams plan to dock at the space station and be welcomed aboard by cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub and Alexander Grebenkin, along with NASA's Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson.\n\nKononenko logged his 1,000th day in space across five flights Tuesday, underscoring his title as the world's most experienced spaceman, 220 days beyond the previous mark of 879 days set by cosmonaut Gennady Padalka in 2015.\n\nThe Starliner is tentatively scheduled to undock and return to Earth on June 14, but the flight could be extended depending on the weather at desert landing sites in the western United States.\n\nIf the Starliner test flight goes well, NASA managers plan to certify the spacecraft for routine crew rotation flights, launching one Crew Dragon and one Starliner each year to deliver long-duration crew members to the station for six-month tours of duty.\n\nNASA funded development of Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner to end the agency's sole post-shuttle reliance on Russian Soyuz for flights to the space station. Two spacecraft from different vendors were ordered to ensure the agency would be able to launch crews to the outpost even if one company's ferry ship was grounded for any reason.\n\nBoeing initially planned to launch the Starliner on its first piloted flight in 2020, but the spacecraft encountered multiple problems during an initial unpiloted launch in December 2019. The company fixed those issues and opted to launch a second uncrewed flight at its own expense but then ran into problems with corroded propulsion system valves.\n\nA second, successful uncrewed test flight was finally launched in May 2022. But after the spacecraft returned to Earth, engineers discovered protective tape wrapped around electrical lines inside the ship could pose a fire risk. Then they found possible problems with parachute harness connectors. When all was said and done, the first piloted flight was pushed into 2023.\n\nWilmore and Williams first strapped in for launch on May 6 only to be grounded by trouble with a pressure-relief valve in the Atlas 5's Centaur upper stage.\n\nA more vexing problem then cropped up: a small-but-persistent helium leak in the Starliner's propulsion system that affected one of 24 low-power maneuvering thrusters in the capsule's service module. Mission managers ultimately decided to launch the spacecraft as is, concluding the leak did not pose any credible safety risk.\n\nLaunch was rescheduled for June 1, but crew's second countdown stopped at the T-minus three-minute and 50-second mark when one of ULA's ground launch sequencer computers, one of three networked systems controlling the final moments of the countdown, failed to run in synch with its counterparts.\n\nThe problem was traced to a faulty power supply. Work to install and test replacement hardware delayed the Starliner's third launch attempt to Wednesday.\n\nSneak peek: Who Wanted Nicki Lenway Dead?\n\n\"Creepy crawly\" giant flying Joro spiders are

It was 2015, and Wilmore was returning to Earth in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft after spending 167 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The landing was on solid ground in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, but braking rockets at the bottom of the Soyuz -- which was descending by parachute -- should have cushioned the impact in the instant before it hit the ground. There was, however, the additional matter of ice covering the soil in the cold Kazakh November.\n\n\"It's the hardest thing I've ever experienced on landing,\" Wilmore says. \"I didn't get the breath knocked out of me, but I was still shocked.\"\n\nWilmore expects a gentler go of things next week, when he and his crewmate, astronaut Suni Williams, return to Earth after flying the maiden mission of Boeing's new Starliner spacecraft. Starliner took off this morning from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, at 10:53 a.m., EDT, carrying Wilmore, the commander, and Williams, the pilot, aloft for an eight-day visit to the ISS. It is only the sixth time in NASA's history that it has launched a new crewed spacecraft -- after the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, shuttles, and Dragon. It is also the first time an American spacecraft descending by parachute will touch down on land instead of in the ocean, eliminating the need for recovery vessels to scramble to the splashdown site. To cushion the impact, the Starliner is equipped with inflatable airbags that Wilmore and Williams call their \"marshmallows.\"\n\n\"We descend at 21 to 27 feet per second, and the airbags push that down to feeling about nine to 15 feet per second,\" Wilmore says. \"So we'll let you know how it goes.\"\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns involving Starliner. The troubled ship has been in development for a decade -- even longer than the space shuttle, which was announced in January 1972 and did not fly until April 1981. NASA first tasked SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 with the job of building commercial crew vehicles that could carry astronauts to and from the ISS, freeing the U.S. from its dependency on the Russians, who were charging in excess of $90 million a seat for rides aboard their Soyuz. NASA awarded Boeing $4.2 billion for the work and SpaceX $2.6 billion, targeting 2017 as the year the ships would begin to fly. Neither company came close.\n\nSpaceX did not launch a crew to the ISS until 2020, and as for Boeing, well, until this week, the clock was still ticking. An only partly successful uncrewed test flight in 2019 saw the ship get to space but fail to dock with the ISS. It wasn't until 2022 that the company launched a successful uncrewed test mission. The current much-delayed launch comes as Boeing faces serial woes on its commercial aircraft side, after two crashes of its 737 line -- one in 2018 and one in 2019 -- claimed 346 lives; a door blew off a 737 Max jet during flight in January 2024; the 737 failed multiple Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) audits in the wake of the incident; and two whistleblowers who had come out against the company regarding production and safety issues suddenly died -- one on May 2, of a severe infection, and the other, in March, of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. The company has not been implicated in the deaths. All of that has both NASA and Boeing's space division working hard to keep the focus on the Starliner launch, especially on the imperative of bringing Wilmore and Williams home safely.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,\" said NASA's associate administrator Jim Free at an April 25 press conference. \"The lives of our crew members...are at stake. We don't take that lightly at all. The most important thing we can do is protect those two people, as well as our crew currently on board the space station.\"\n\nAsked by one reporter how important it is for Boeing to \"score a win\" with the Starliner flight, Mark Nappi, vice president and manager of the Boeing Commercial Crew Program, deflected back to safety.\n\n\"We have humans flying on this vehicle,\" he said. \"We always take that so seriously...we signed up to do this, and we're going to do it and be successful at it.\"\n\nThe astronauts themselves, who spoke to TIME remotely from pre-flight quarantine on May 1 in the days before an earlier planned launch was scrubbed for technical reasons, profess confidence in their craft, while at the same time acknowledging that it and Boeing as a whole face challenges.\n\n\"We've been laser-focused on Starliner,\" says Williams. \"This is the only thing that we're really concentrating on. I think it's not a secret to say that the spacecraft was delayed a little bit. We've added some areas that we thought really needed improvement...we wanted to make sure that they got done, and the response was good.\"\n\nAdds Wilmore: \"I went to test pilot's school in 1992, and [I've] been doing tests for a long time. Boeing is a very highly visible company. When you're taking people and you're flying them in the atmosphere and then out of the atmosphere, that's more highly visible, so you're going to get more press on that type of thing.\"\n\nWhether the spacecraft, now that it's aloft, will garner better press than the company that built it is impossible to know at the moment. But the stakes for Boeing -- to say nothing of Wilmore and Williams -- could not be higher.\n\nThe blunder that doomed Starliner's 2019 mission was an embarrassing one for both NASA and Boeing. The ship had problems with its mission clock when it reached space, meaning that it didn't know what its altitude was and burned too much fuel trying to get oriented, preventing it from being able to climb to the station's 250-mile orbit. In a press statement, NASA called the orbit \"off-nominal\" -- space-speak for \"no good.\" The Starliner landed safely two days later in New Mexico, but a NASA investigation enumerated 80 \"corrective actions\" -- to software, hardware, testing protocols, peer reviews, and more -- that would have to be made for Starliner to be determined fit for flight.\n\nIn May 2022, an uncrewed Starliner did complete a mission to the station. After two more years of crew-training and spacecraft certification, not to mention delays caused by the simple business of trying to schedule multiple spacecraft competing for the station's limited docking ports -- the crewed Russian Soyuz, the crewed SpaceX Dragon, and uncrewed cargo vehicles from Russia, SpaceX, and Northrop Grumman -- Starliner at last got its runway slot.\n\nBut Boeing has a lot of catching up to do before it comes anywhere near what SpaceX has accomplished in the decade since the two companies won their commercial crew contracts. Between transporting cargo and astronauts, SpaceX has made 42 visits to the ISS. While Boeing was never contracted for uncrewed cargo runs to the station, SpaceX's demonstrated ability to fly up and down reliably has made it a national and global leader in commercial launch services. At the April 25 press conference, Nappi would not even guarantee that Boeing would remain in the commercial crew game after the company's six contracted flights to the station are completed by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We've got plenty of time to think about what's after that,\" he said. \"And we will do that.\"\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are not remotely thinking so far down the line. Their nominal mission will last for a brief eight days aboard the station, most of which time they'll spend checking out the Starliner and ensuring it will be fit to fly future crews for much longer stays. Merely reaching and docking with the station will serve to prove that the spacecraft's guidance and navigation systems work. But there's a lot more to approving a new spacecraft than just determining it can get where it's going.\n\nThe two astronauts will be running tests on Starliner's solar arrays, communications, on-board computers, power systems, and more. They will also check the simple matter of how airtight the ship is once it's docked to the station. That's important not just to prevent air leaks, but to establish that the spacecraft can serve as a shelter-in-place haven in the event of an emergency like a sudden depressurization of the station, a fire, or a toxic ammonia leak from the coolant system used in the ISS's American modules.\n\n\"In case of any of those classic emergencies,\" says Williams, \"our lifeboat is our spacecraft.\"\n\nSome of the station's other seven crew members will also lend a hand, climbing into the Starliner with Williams and Wilmore and determining if the ship can comfortably accommodate the four-person crews who will be flying it on future missions. In return, Williams and Wilmore are prepared to help out on space station experiments and maintenance chores -- especially if their mission is extended. Technical anomalies aboard the spacecraft or high winds in the various desert Southwest landing spots in which the spacecraft can thump down could delay the crew's return by a month or more. Williams and Wilmore, who have both served on long-duration station rotations previously, are hoping that this one will be a short one. The Starliner is a reusable spacecraft, and if the one they're flying holds up well, it will be used on future missions.\n\n\"We want to go and get back as quickly as possible so they can turn our spacecraft around and also take all those lessons learned and incorporate them into the next Starliner,\" says Williams.\n\nAssuming this mission succeeds, at least a few of those next Starliners are all but certain to fly. Beyond 2030, NASA, for one, is hoping Starliner continues in service. It's not for nothing that the space agency chose two companies rather than just one to build its low-Earth orbit spacecraft. That provides what NASA calls \"dissimilar redundancy,\" something that will prevent the country from being grounded if one of the launch providers has an accident or goes out of service for any period -- the way the U.S. was stuck on Earth after both the shuttle Columbia and Challenger disasters and in the nine years after the shuttles were retired in 2011.\n\nAs for the bruised Boeing brand, the current mission will establish if at least some recovery is possible. Both the company and NASA stress that Boeing was the prime contractor on the station itself, and, along with building Starliner, that is no small thing. The ISS, said Emily Nelson, NASA's chief flight director, at the press conference, \"is the longest continuously operational spacecraft in human history. So we're excited to bring the two together.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams, meanwhile, are excited to make a different kind of history. As the first crew to fly a new spacecraft, they earn a spot in the NASA firmament, along with giants like Alan Shepard, the first man to fly a Mercury spacecraft; Gus Grissom, the first commander of a Gemini spacecraft; Wally Schirra, who piloted the inaugural Apollo; and John Young, commander of the first shuttle.\n\n\"It's very humbling,\" says Wilmore. \"You pinch yourself because we never dreamed we'd be here. We're just grateful for the opportunity, and that's why we're focused on mission, mission, mission.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\"

(NYSE:BA) successfully launched its Starliner spacecraft with astronauts on board for the first time on Tuesday.\n\nThe spacecraft, carrying NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, took off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:52 a.m. ET.\n\nWhat Happened: The Starliner, propelled by an Atlas V rocket, began its journey to the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThe launch took place after a series of delays and setbacks, reported NBC News. It was met with a mix of cheers and car alarms sounding from the nearby beach.\n\nWilmore, the mission's commander, and Williams, the pilot, are both experienced astronauts. Wilmore has completed two previous spaceflights, while Williams has completed two stints aboard the ISS. The mission is a test flight to demonstrate the Starliner's capability to safely transport crew members to and from low-Earth orbit.\n\nBoeing's Starliner is designed to fly autonomously, but the astronauts will take control at various points to demonstrate the capsule's handling and practice emergency scenarios.\n\nThe spacecraft is also designed to autonomously dock with the space station, but the astronauts will test its manual controls on their final approach.\n\nWhy It Matters: The successful launch of the Starliner marks a significant milestone for Boeing, which has been working to catch up with its competitor, SpaceX, in the commercial crewed spaceflight arena. SpaceX has been conducting regular crewed flights to the ISS since 2020 with its Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wished Boeing \"best of luck\". The success of Boeing's inaugural manned mission could provide NASA with a much-needed second option for crewed spaceflights.\n\nRead Next: Roaring Kitty Just Posted A Reverse Uno Card - What Does It Signal For GameStop, AMC Shares?\n\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GameStop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/Boeing_2_800x533_L_1412237315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nBoeing's Starliner mission will make a third attempt at launching its first crewed flight test Wednesday in a milestone that has been a decade in the making.\n\nThe new spacecraft's maiden voyage with humans on board is on track to lift off atop an Atlas V rocket at 10:52 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe historic event will stream live on NASA's website, with coverage beginning at 6:45 a.m. ET.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are set to ride aboard the Starliner capsule on a journey that takes them to the International Space Station.\n\nWeather conditions are 90% favorable for a Wednesday morning launch, with the only concern being cumulus clouds, according to the US Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron. If liftoff does not occur on Wednesday, there is another opportunity at 10:29 a.m. ET Thursday, according to NASA.\n\nThe mission, known as the Crew Flight Test, is the culmination of Boeing's efforts to develop a spacecraft to rival SpaceX's prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand the United States' options for ferrying astronauts to the space station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The federal agency's initiative aims to foster collaboration with private industry partners.\n\nIf successful, the flight would mark only the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a May news conference.\n\n\"It started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX's) Dragon -- and now Starliner,\" Nelson said.\n\nWilliams will also make history as the first woman to fly aboard such a mission.\n\nIf Starliner successfully lifts off, the astronauts will spend just over 24 hours traveling to the space station.\n\nAfter docking around 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday, Williams and Wilmore are set to spend eight days living in the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board.\n\nAboard Starliner is a crucial pump needed to fix the space station's urine processor assembly, which failed on May 29.\n\n\"That urine processor takes all of the crew's urine and processes it in the first step of a water recovery system,\" said Dana Weigel, manager for NASA's International Space Station Program. \"It then sends it downstream to a water processor which turns it into drinking water. The station's really designed to be a closed loop.\"\n\nNow, the urine has to be stored onboard in containers, so Starliner's anticipated arrival to the space station can't come soon enough.\n\nThe astronauts will test various aspects of Starliner's capabilities, including the spacecraft's thruster performance, how their spacesuits function within the capsule, and manual piloting in case the crew needs to override the spacecraft's autopilot.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will also test Starliner's \"safe haven\" capability, designed to offer the space station crew a shelter if there is a problem, according to Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, during a May 31 news conference.\n\nWhen it's time to head home, the astronauts will return using the same Starliner capsule and parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.\n\nYears of development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner's path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing's competitor under NASA's Commercial Crew program -- SpaceX -- has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency's astronauts.\n\nThis mission could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing's Starliner spacecraft ready for routine operations to deliver astronauts and cargo to the space station.\n\nA number of issues caused the previous crewed launch attempts, on May 6 and June 1, to be scrubbed.\n\nTwo hours prior to the launch attempt on May 6, engineers identified an issue with a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket, which was built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The entire stack, including the rocket and spacecraft, was rolled back from the launchpad for testing and repairs.\n\nTeams also worked through a small helium leak within the spacecraft service module, a \"design vulnerability\" in the propulsion system and assessed the parachutes for the Starliner capsule.\n\nStarliner was just 3 minutes and 50 seconds from liftoff Saturday afternoon, when an automatic hold was triggered by the ground launch sequencer, or the computer that launches the rocket.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance technicians and engineers assessed the ground support equipment over the weekend, examining three large computers housed inside a shelter at the base of the launchpad. Each computer is the same, providing triple redundancy to ensure the safe launch of crewed missions.\n\n\"Imagine a large rack that is a big computer where the functions of the computer as a controller are broken up separately into individual cards or printed wire circuit boards,\" said Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United Launch Alliance, during a Saturday news conference. \"They're all stand-alone, but together, it's an integrated controller.\"\n\nThe cards within the computers are responsible for different key systems that must occur before a launch, such as releasing bolts at the rocket's base so it can lift off after ignition.\n\nDuring the final four minutes before launch, all three computers must communicate and agree with one another. But during Saturday's countdown, a card on one of the computers was six seconds slower in responding than the other two computers, indicating that something was not correct and triggering an automatic hold, according to Bruno.\n\nOver the weekend, engineers evaluated the computers, their power supply and network communications between the computers. The team isolated the issue to a single ground power supply within one of the computers, which provides power to the computer cards responsible for key countdown events -- including the replenishment valves for the rocket's upper stage, which also caused an issue during the countdown, according to an update shared by NASA.\n\nStarliner teams reported no signs of physical damage to the computer, which they removed and replaced with a spare. The other computers and their cards were also assessed, and all of them are performing normally as expected, according to the ULA team.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The spacecraft, powered by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, is carrying the astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station (ISS), where they will stay for a week before returning to Earth.\n\nUS Navy Captain Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams had remained on standby after the first cancellation of the flight on May 6, when a failure was detected in the launcher's oxygen pressure regulation valve. After the ULA repaired the device, during pre-launch tests a helium leak was detected in the Starliner service module, which required further testing. Finally, the operation was scheduled for last Saturday, but a problem in the power supply for the computer cards that control the launcher forced a suspension just 180 seconds before takeoff. The failure was repaired on Sunday.\n\nBoeing's Starliner is part of the NASA program that aims for private companies to develop permanent services for transporting people and cargo to the ISS. The capsule has a height of five meters and a diameter of 4.6. It is designed to be reused up to 10 times and carry up to seven people on each trip, although the missions planned by NASA for this commercial transportation program do not exceed five crew members per trip.\n\nThe two astronauts are veteran pilots of the US Armed Forces and each has already traveled to the ISS on two occasions. Wilmore has expressed confidence in the mission, which he described as a test but safe. \"We wouldn't be here if it weren't,\" said the pilot on behalf of both crew members.\n\nDuring the flight, in-orbit tests will be carried out on the performance of the life support system, the manual and automatic control of the ship and other critical elements before docking with the ISS. After a week on the station, the astronauts are scheduled to land in the southwestern United States.

2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\nThe Starliner program has been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission will offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNasa meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS - something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\nEmbarrassing setbacks\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favoured, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nThe first crewed launch attempt on May 6 was scuppered in the final hours due to a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket the capsule sits atop.\n\nThen on Saturday, things were even more dramatic with liftoff aborted with less than four minutes left on the countdown clock as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nIn both cases, Wilmore and Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the first crewed launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nThe astronauts will now be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, they will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United

The rocket that launched today (June 5), powered at liftoff by a Russian-built RD-180 first-stage engine, carried Boeing's Starliner crew ferry ship to orbit following multiple launch delays over the past several days. The spacecraft departed from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Pad 41 (a few miles from Cooper's 1963 launch site) at 10:52 am EDT and is considered a \"shakedown\" flight to the International Space Station.\n\nOn board are former Navy test pilots Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, both now active-duty NASA astronauts. Between them, they have four space flights logged, including 500 days in orbit and 11 space walks. Their mission calls for monitoring automated controls during the initial launch, testing manual controls enroute, then monitoring the automated 25-hour rendezvous and docking sequence with the International Space Station just past noon tomorrow (EDT).\n\nBoeing's Starliner is considered four years behind Elon Musk's SpaceX Crew Dragon, which has already carried 50 astronauts, Russian cosmonauts, and civilians on 13 orbital flights since 2020, all but one to the space station. But Williams and Wilmore say the Starliner is safer and more capable than the competition, with multiple upgrades. Williams said, \"I'm not going to say it's been easy...We knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"\n\nElon Musk, founder of SpaceX, posted a congratulatory message to the Starliner team on his social media platform X. \"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" he wrote.\n\nAfter docking and meeting with the astronauts and cosmonauts currently on board the space station, the Starliner crew is scheduled to begin its return journey to Earth on June 14. That date is subject to weather forecasts for the landing sites in western U.S. desert regions. Going forward, NASA is expected to certify the Starliner for annual routine rotation flights to the space station.

But no such trouble was expected and a thruster firing 31 minutes after liftoff was planned to put the ship in orbit.\n\nThe astronauts planned to test the Starliner's manual controls and then closely monitor an automated 25-hour rendezvous with the station, catching up from behind and below before moving in for docking at the lab's forward port just past noon Thursday.\n\nThe long-awaited flight marked the first launch of an Atlas 5 with astronauts aboard and the first for the Atlas family of rockets since astronaut Gordon Cooper took off just a few miles away on the Mercury program's final flight 61 years ago.\n\nIt also marks the first piloted flight of the Starliner, Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020.\n\nDespite a larger NASA contract, Boeing's Starliner is four years behind SpaceX getting astronauts to space. But Wilmore and Williams say the spacecraft is now safer and more capable thanks to numerous upgrades and fixes.\n\n\"I'm not going to say it's been easy. It's a little bit of (an) emotional roller coaster,\" Williams said before the crew's first launch attempt. But, she added, \"we knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"\n\nWhile Wilmore and Williams are closing in on the space station Thursday, SpaceX plans to launch its gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its fourth test flight from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, \"Starbase\" facility.\n\nThe booster will attempt a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico shortly after liftoff while the Starship upper stage continues into space, looping halfway around the planet before re-entry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn three previous flights, both stages were destroyed in flight, but performance dramatically improved with each launch as upgrades and fixes were implemented, and SpaceX expects more of the same with the fourth test flight.\n\nThe Super Heavy has nothing to do with Boeing's Starliner or the space station, but NASA will be paying close attention because the agency plans to use a variant of the Starship to carry astronauts down to the moon's surface in its Artemis program. Perfecting the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage are crucial to those plans.\n\nWilmore and Williams plan to dock at the space station and be welcomed aboard by cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub and Alexander Grebenkin, along with NASA's Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson.\n\nKononenko logged his 1,000th day in space across five flights Tuesday, underscoring his title as the world's most experienced spaceman, 220 days beyond the previous mark of 879 days set by cosmonaut Gennady Padalka in 2015.\n\nThe Starliner is tentatively scheduled to undock and return to Earth on June 14, but the flight could be extended depending on the weather at desert landing sites in the western United States.\n\nIf the Starliner test flight goes well, NASA managers plan to certify the spacecraft for routine crew rotation flights, launching one Crew Dragon and one Starliner each year to deliver long-duration crew members to the station for six-month tours of duty.\n\nNASA funded development of Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner to end the agency's sole post-shuttle reliance on Russian Soyuz for flights to the space station. Two spacecraft from different vendors were ordered to ensure the agency would be able to launch crews to the outpost even if one company's ferry ship was grounded for any reason.\n\nBoeing initially planned to launch the Starliner on its first piloted flight in 2020, but the spacecraft encountered multiple problems during an initial unpiloted launch in December 2019. The company fixed those issues and opted to launch a second uncrewed flight at its own expense but then ran into problems with corroded propulsion system valves.\n\nA second, successful uncrewed test flight was finally launched in May 2022. But after the spacecraft returned to Earth, engineers discovered protective tape wrapped around electrical lines inside the ship could pose a fire risk. Then they found possible problems with parachute harness connectors. When all was said and done, the first piloted flight was pushed into 2023.\n\nWilmore and Williams first strapped in for launch on May 6 only to be grounded by trouble with a pressure-relief valve in the Atlas 5's Centaur upper stage.\n\nA more vexing problem then cropped up: a small-but-persistent helium leak in the Starliner's propulsion system that affected one of 24 low-power maneuvering thrusters in the capsule's service module. Mission managers ultimately decided to launch the spacecraft as is, concluding the leak did not pose any credible safety risk.\n\nLaunch was rescheduled for June 1, but crew's second countdown stopped at the T-minus three-minute and 50-second mark when one of ULA's ground launch sequencer computers, one of three networked systems controlling the final moments of the countdown, failed to run in synch with its counterparts.\n\nThe problem was traced to a faulty power supply. Work to install and test replacement hardware delayed the Starliner's third launch attempt to Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [],

Engineering and budget issues have delayed fulfilling the contract, and , Boeing has spent an extra $1.5 billion to get to where it is.\n\nSpaceX, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, is NASA's other partner in its commercial crew program to take astronauts to and from the ISS, and SpaceX already completed several crewed missions to the ISS.

role within the increasingly active space industry.\n\nIt is only the sixth time Nasa astronauts have taken off in a new, never-before-crewed, spacecraft.\n\nStarliner is also the second certified spacecraft designed to ferry cargo and crew to the ISS.\n\nThe space capsule took off atop a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket from the US Space Force's Cape Canaveral launch site.\n\nOn board Starliner are astronauts Butch Wilmore, 61, and Suni Williams, 58, who are headed to the ISS for a week-long stay.\n\nIt will be the third time the astronaut duo have visited the orbital outpost.\n\nThe $1.5billion spacecraft was due to take off on its first crewed mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on 7 May.\n\nHowever, the initial launch was aborted after a strange buzzing sound was discovered coming from an oxygen valve just before take-off.\n\nIt was scrubbed twice more after a separate, but persistent, helium leak in Starliner's propulsion system was discovered.\n\nFailure to launch would have served as a major blow for the aerospace giant as it fights to save its reputation after a string of safety failures.\n\nStarliner was created in collaboration with NASA's Commercial Crew Programme, which is similar to its now-defunct Shuttle programme.\n\nIt's aimed at making space flights commercially available, frequently ferrying people and cargo back and forth from Earth.\n\nThe capsule can be reused up to 10 times.\n\n\"For Nasa service missions to the International Space Station, it will carry up to four Nasa-sponsored crew members and time-critical scientific research,\" Boeing said.\n\nBoeing is hopeful the spacecraft can eventually transport humans to Mars if it ever gets off the ground.\n\nPrior to its first crewed launch today, Starliner had already flown twice.\n\nHowever, the capsule suffered several problems on its first mission in December 2019, and only successfully met all flight goals in its second launch in

attempt", "body": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida -- Boeing will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 a.m. (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\nEmbarrassing setbacks\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWhen they do fly, Wilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will carry out more tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"},

The crew was launched at 10:52 a.m. ET to fly aboard the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from the Space Launch Complex-41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Sunita Williams Third Space Mission Called Off: Launch Of Boeing Starliner Carrying Indian-Origin Astronaut Postponed, NASA Reveals Reason.\n\n\"Liftoff! Go #AtlasV! Go Centaur! Go #Starliner!\" Boeing Space said in a post on X. \"Godspeed, Butch Wilmore and @Astro_Suni!\" It added. The flight comes after several delays over the years. The first human flight was slated on May 7, but was delayed over a helium leak and later due to an issue with the ground power supply at the ULA. NASA Crew 7 Returns to Earth After Spending 197 Days Aboard International Space Station.\n\nThis is the third attempt and the weather was 90 per cent favourable for the launch. Butch, 61, will be commanding the flight, and Williams, will be piloting the flight. The duo will stay at the International Space Station station for about a week before returning to Earth aboard the reusable crew capsule.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

for crewed Boeing Starliner launch attempt", "body": "Graphic on the Boeing Starliner, which will make its first crewed mission to the International Space Station on the Atlas V rocket.\n\nBoeing will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the station.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n\"Wishing them best of luck!\" Musk tweeted Wednesday.\n\nMore from this section Bridgeport motorcyclist in critical condition after serious accident Yonkers celebrates Hispanic culture during annual Puerto Rican Day parade President Biden to issue executive actions limiting asylum requests at the southern border - Embarrassing setbacks -\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nia/bgs", "source": {"uri":

This is an awesome day.\"\n\nSpace Launch Delta 45's weather squadron forecasts a 90% chance for good conditions.\n\nThe pair look to launch on the Crew Flight Test, a followup to two uncrewed test flights, the first of which came in 2019. That mission was a partial failure as it was not able to rendezvous with the International Space Station forcing a 2 1/2-year delay to Boeing's program to remedy hardware, software and management issues. The second uncrewed test flight in 2022 made it to the ISS, but post-launch review and preparation for the CFT brought further delays with more hardware issues popping up.\n\nBut half a decade later, Williams and Wilmore were set to fly, and entered quarantine on April 22. Finally, on May 6, they tried for the first time to take off from the Space Coast, but an issue with a fluttering valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage scrubbed that attempt with about two hours to go on the countdown clock. Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" Fincke said. \"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building venturing out after 7:30 a.m. to climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral and make their way back on board the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nBefore driving over, they played a traditional prelaunch game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba -- this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The idea is that losing that game is the worst thing that happens on a launch day.\n\n\"Speaking as a child of the 70s, a lot of us watched \"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood\" and Mr. Rogers would tell us to take our time to do it right, and that's what we're doing here,\" Fincke said.\n\nJust before 9 a.m., teams waited the conclusion of a weather brief before moving forward with hatch closure, but were given the go for hatch closure with less than two hours to go before launch.\n\n\"We are ready. We're smiling out here, see you in a couple weeks,\" said Wilmore.\n\nIf they manage to lift off, the astronauts will spend just over 24 hours making their way to the ISS where they will spend about eight days on board before returning to Earth for a landing in the desert in the southwestern United States.\n\n\"Today is a great day to put on a spacesuit and climb into a spacecraft and go launch,\" Fincke said.\n\nIf successful, this will be the final required mission for Boeing under NASA's Commercial Crew Program to achieve certification and set up regular rotational missions to the ISS, sharing duties with SpaceX.\n\nWilmore and Williams will spend time on both the way up and down from the ISS testing out manual control overrides among other facets of the mostly automated spacecraft.\n\n\"There's a thought of how things should be, but then there's the reality how things need to be,\" said Wilmore ahead of the launch attempt. \"That's what this test is all -- everything we do is test. It's been a process over the years that is such a benefit in all aspects of the capabilities of this spacecraft, and we're excited to be a part of it.\"\n\nThe pair are former Navy test pilots and veterans of two spaceflight each, with both having traveled on board Russia Soyuz capsules as well as the space shuttle. Wilmore is commander and joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2000 while Williams joined in 1998.\n\nWilliams was given the honor to name the capsule after it landed, and dubbed it Calypso, in deference to oceanographer Jacques Cousteau'sfamed vessel. The zero-gravity indicator for the mission follows the maritime theme, a stuffed narwhal that is also named Calypso.\n\nThe flight comes just over four years since SpaceX made its first crewed flight to the ISS with its Crew Dragon spacecraft, which has since flown 13 times carrying 50 humans to space. That includes the four members of Crew-8 awaiting along with the rest of the seven-person crew of Expedition 71 aboard the ISS.\n\nISS crew members Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson recorded a message for Williams and Wilmore ahead of their last attempt to launch this past Saturday.\n\n\"We can't wait for you guys to join us here on station,\" Dyson said. \"We'll be monitoring your every move on the journey and we'll be waiting to open the hatch and welcome you to your home away from home.\"\n\n\"We know you've waited a while to get your ride aboard Starliner, but we know it will have been worth every minute,\" Epps added. \"So from all of us on the International Space Station, godspeed and we'll see you soon.\"\n\nStarliner is only the sixth ever U.S.-based spacecraft to fly with NASA astronauts following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttleand SpaceX's Crew Dragon. Williams is the first woman to fly on an orbital test flight among NASA's spacecraft.\n\nIt also marks a return of human launches from Cape Canaveral's launch pads, which last saw a crewed flight in 1968 with the launch of Apollo7. Every Apollo mission afterward as well as the space shuttle and Crew Dragon launches have come from nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt's the first time an Atlas V will fly with humans as well, although earlier iterations of the Atlas rocket flew several human spaceflights in the early 1960s including John Glenn's historic trip to space as the first American to each orbit in 1962. This also marks the 100th launch of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nStarliner will also become the first U.S.-based capsule to make a land touchdown as Crew Dragon, Apollo, Gemini and Mercury all made waterlandings, as will the Artemis program's Orion capsule that has yet to fly with humans. Russia's Soyuz, though, features land touchdowns.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_tribou@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Richard Tribou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_Delta_45", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch Delta 45"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Acaba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph M.

The project, which was meant to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule under NASA's commercial crew program, encountered plenty of setbacks, from the discovery of flammable materials inside the spacecraft to a strange \"buzzing\" sound that forced officials to scrub the first of three launch attempts last month.\n\nDespite those hurdles, Boeing has now prevailed, limping over the finish line with today's crewed test launch.\n\nHowever, the elephant in the room is SpaceX, which has already made ten successful trips to the ISS over the last five years (and with a reusable rocket, to boot).\n\nNonetheless, it's still a momentous occasion in the world of space exploration, a big step in the United States' efforts to establish independent ways to get astronauts into space without relying on Russia.\n\n\"Congratulations to NASA, Boeing, and ULA on this morning's launch to the space station, and Godspeed to Butch, Suni and Starliner on your flight!\" SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell tweeted.\n\nBut Boeing isn't out of the woods just yet.

Following years of delays and engineering issues, this launch marks a celebratory moment. Fellow astronauts aboard the International Space Station witnessed this historic event, a glimpse of the same was also shared on social media.\n\n\"This Crew Flight Test aims to certify the spacecraft for routine space travel to and from the @Space_Station,\" NASA earlier posted on its X (formerly Twitter) account. The astronauts are onboard a Boeing capsule, set to reach orbit with the assistance of an Atlas V rocket. This launch marks the most recent phase in NASA's strategy to increase its dependence on the private sector for its human spaceflight initiatives.\n\nOriginally set to launch at 10:52 am EDT (14:52 GMT) from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the mission to send NASA's Boeing Starliner carrying astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore into space wasn't just witnessed from the Earth.\n\nNASA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), a crucial device always positioned over certain areas to primarily support weather forecasting services, documented the spacecraft's fiery journey. These GOES photos, combined with the view from the space station, provide a stunning view of human achievement aiming for the stars.\n\nAlso read: Boeing finally launches historic Starliner mission with Sunita Williams onboard; Elon Musk reacts\n\nThe National Weather Service State College shared a video showing the satellite images, which seem to depict a trail of smoke as the spacecraft took off.

Liftoff is scheduled for 10:52 a.m. ET from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nThe next day, SpaceX will conduct a fourth, uncrewed test flight of its Starship megarocket. Thursday's launch will occur at SpaceX's Starbase test site in Boca Chica, Texas, with a target launch window that opens at 8 a.m. ET.\n\nThe two companies are seen as spaceflight competitors, but the launches this week have different goals. Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was developed in partnership with NASA, to ferry its astronauts to and from the space station -- a commercial service that SpaceX has already been performing for the agency since 2020.\n\nIf Boeing's first crewed test flight is successful, it would pave the way for the Starliner capsule to conduct routine flights to the space station for NASA, challenging SpaceX's dominance.\n\nOnboard the Starliner will be NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who plan to spend about a week at the space station before returning to Earth and touching down at New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range.\n\nStarliner's last launch attempt was called off Saturday with less than four minutes to go before liftoff, after an automatic abort was triggered by one of the computers that controls the Atlas V rocket. The rocket is manufactured by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nIt was Boeing's second launch attempt. The first, on May 6, was scuttled with about two hours to go in the countdown due to an issue with a valve on the rocket. A helium leak was later found in the Starliner capsule's propulsion system, which led to further delays.\n\nBoeing's Starliner program overall has been plagued by delays and technical glitches. On the spaceship's first uncrewed flight in 2019, software problems forced mission controllers to cut the trip short. The company's next attempt was then delayed several times due to fuel valve issues. It wasn't until 2022 that Boeing completed an uncrewed flight to and from the space station.\n\nStarship's test flight Thursday is meant to demonstrate technologies and techniques that will be key on future missions to the moon.\n\nStarship is the most powerful rocket ever developed and is designed to be fully reusable. The system is expected to play an important role in NASA's plan to return astronauts to the moon: NASA selected Starship to carry astronauts to the lunar surface in the Artemis III mission, which could launch in 2026.\n\nSpaceX also hopes to use Starship to eventually reach Mars.\n\nNASA is separately developing its own Space Launch System megarocket and Orion spacecraft for missions to the moon. As part of the Artemis program, NASA envisions regular missions to establish a base camp on the lunar surface before eventually venturing to Mars.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240603-spacex-starship-launch-vl-1152a-d81e3d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 103, "textEnd": 111}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1838, "textEnd": 1843}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n- Embarrassing setbacks - More from this section Met commissioner slammed for 'extreme right' protest jibe Grant Shapps issues plea to Reform voters after Nigel Farage announcement France, England lead the contenders as Germany hosts Euro 2024\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWhen they do fly, Wilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will carry out more tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nia/st", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com",

Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" Fincke said. \"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building from where they will climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral to make they back aboard the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nThey played the traditional game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba, this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The idea is that losing that game is the worst thing that happens on a launch day.\n\n\"It's a well choreographed orchestra today,\" Fincke said. \"Everything it seems is going on time.\"\n\nIf they manage to lift off, the astronauts will spend just over 24 hours making their way to the ISS where they will spend about eight days on board before returning to Earth for a landing in the desert in the southwestern United States.\n\n\"Today is a great day to put on a spacesuit and climb into climb into a spacecraft and go launch,\" Fincke said.\n\nIf successful, this will be the final required mission for Boeing under NASA's Commercial Crew Program to achieve certification and set up regular rotational missions to the ISS, sharing duties with SpaceX. Wilmore and Williams will spend time on both the way up and down from the ISS testing out manual control overrides among other facets of the mostly automated spacecraft.\n\nThe pair are former Navy test pilots and veterans of two spaceflight each, with both having traveled on board Russia Soyuz capsules as well as the space shuttle. Wilmore is commander and joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2000 while Williams joined in 1998.\n\nWilliams was given the honor to name the capsule after it landed, and dubbed it Calypso, in deference to oceanographer Jacques Cousteau's\n\nfamed vessel. The zero-gravity indicator for the mission follows the maritime theme, a stuffed narwhal that is also named Calypso.\n\nThe flight comes just over four years since SpaceX made its first crewed flight to the ISS with its Crew Dragon spacecraft, which has since flown 13 times carrying 50 humans to space. That includes the four members of Crew-8 awaiting along with the rest of the seven-person crew of Expedition 71 aboard the ISS.\n\nISS crew members Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson recorded a message for Williams and Wilmore ahead of their last attempt to launch this past Saturday.\n\n\"We can't wait for you guys to join us here on station,\" Dyson said. \"We'll be monitoring your every move on the journey and we'll be waiting to open the hatch and welcome you to your home away from home.\"\n\n\"We know you've waited a while to get your ride aboard Starliner, but we know it will have been worth every minute,\" Epps added. \"So from all of us on the International Space Station, godspeed and we'll see you soon.\"\n\nStarliner is only the sixth ever U.S.-based spacecraft to fly with NASA astronauts following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle\n\nand SpaceX's Crew Dragon. Williams is the first woman to fly on an orbital test flight among NASA's spacecraft.\n\nIt also marks a return of human launches from Cape Canaveral's launch pads, which last saw a crewed flight in 1968 with the launch of Apollo\n\n7. Every Apollo mission afterward as well as the space shuttle and Crew Dragon launches have come from nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt's the first time an Atlas V will fly with humans as well, although earlier iterations of the Atlas rocket flew several human spaceflights in the early 1960s including John Glenn's historic trip to space as the first American to each orbit in 1962. This also marks the 100th launch of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nStarliner will also become the first U.S.-based capsule to make a land touchdown as Crew Dragon, Apollo, Gemini and Mercury all made water\n\nlandings, as will the Artemis program's Orion capsule that has yet to fly with humans. Russia's Soyuz, though, features land touchdowns.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_tribou@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Richard Tribou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_Delta_45", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch Delta 45"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Acaba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph M.

(AP) -- Boeing geared up again Wednesday for its first astronaut launch, held up for years by safety concerns.\n\nIt was the third launch attempt for NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams in Boeing's Starliner capsule. Rocket-related trouble thwarted the first two countdowns.\n\nThe astronauts will test Starliner's systems on the way to the International Space Station, where they'll spend at least a week before aiming for a touchdown in the western U.S.\n\nNASA hired Boeing along with SpaceX after the space shuttles retired to transport astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020.\n\nBoeing's capsule rocketed into orbit in 2019 without a crew, but that test flight was cut short by software problems. Boeing had better luck on the do-over mission in 2022, but parachute and other issues later were discovered, delaying Starliner's crew debut even further.\n\nMinutes before Saturday's planned liftoff, a computer's power unit failed at the pad that had to be replaced by rocket maker United Launch Alliance.

The most recent scrub occurred on June 1, just minutes before liftoff, when the ground launch sequencer failed to load properly.\n\nPrevious attempts in May were aborted due to a faulty oxygen relief valve and a helium leak in the service module.\n\nIf successful, the Starliner capsule will reach the ISS after approximately 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost around 250 miles above Earth. Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to remain at the station for roughly a week before returning to Earth via the Starliner for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US southwestern desert - a first for crewed NASA missions.\n\nBoeing's Starliner program has faced numerous challenges since NASA awarded the company $4.2 billion in 2014 to develop a spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nThe project has fallen years behind schedule, with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule becoming NASA's sole vehicle for sending crew to the ISS from US soil since 2020.\n\nThe Starliner's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 failed to reach the ISS due to software glitches, and a second attempt in 2022 was delayed multiple times due to fuel valve issues. Boeing also scrapped a planned crewed flight in 2023 after realizing the adhesive tape on the craft was flammable.\n\nA successful crewed test flight is crucial for Boeing to demonstrate the Starliner's ability to safely transport astronauts and secure a larger share of NASA's business, which has been dominated by SpaceX. Depending on the outcome, Starliner is booked to fly at least six more crewed missions to the ISS for NASA.\n\nWhile SpaceX has become a dependable partner for NASA's crewed missions, Boeing's struggles with the Starliner have raised concerns about the company's ability to deliver on its commitments.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/sunita-williams-launch-live-012628479-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=lxZ5wESIjGeTARA8DkQxsgCNJNYMpugy", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 524, "textEnd": 530}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule. Wednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft. Despite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston. Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.

Human spaceflight is a daring task \" but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday, June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nNASA's arrival and in-flight event coverage is as follows (all times Eastern and subject to change based on real-time operations):\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\n3:30 p.m. \" Post-docking news conference at NASA Johnson with the following participants:\n\nTuesday, June 11\n\n3:15 p.m. \" Wilmore will speak to students from Tennessee Tech University in an event aboard the space station.\n\nCoverage of the Earth to space call will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\nMeet NASA's Crew\n\nWilmore is the commander for the mission. A veteran of two spaceflights, Wilmore has 178 days in space under his belt. In 2009, he served as a pilot aboard space shuttle Atlantis for the STS-129 mission. Additionally, Wilmore served as a flight engineer for Expedition 41 until November 2014, when he assumed command of the space station after arrival of the Expedition 42 crew. He returned to Earth the following March. Prior to his selection by NASA in 2000, the father of two obtained both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, before graduating with another master's degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, and has completed four operational deployments during his tenure as a fleet naval officer and aviator.\n\nWilliams is the spacecraft pilot for the flight test. Williams has spent 322 days in space across two missions: Expedition 14/15 in 2006 through 2007, and Expedition 32/33 in 2012. The Massachusetts native also conducted seven spacewalks, totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes. Before her career began with NASA in 1998, Williams graduated with her bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, before obtaining her master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. In total, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program has delivered on its goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station from the United States through a partnership with American private industry. This partnership is changing the arc of human spaceflight history by opening access to low Earth orbit and the space station to more people, science, and commercial opportunities. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in space exploration, including future missions to the Moon under Artemis and, eventually, Mars.\n\nLearn more about NASA's

Assuming that the test flight goes to plan, Starliner will join SpaceX's Crew Dragon in regularly ferrying astronauts between the ISS and Earth, and will become just the sixth American-made spacecraft in history to be certified to carry human beings into orbit.\n\nStarliner lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 10:52 a.m. EDT on May 6 atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, bound for low-Earth orbit on a crewed mission that has been well over a decade in the making. The test flight will see NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore rendezvous with the ISS for a week-long tour before returning to Earth to land on U.S. soil next week. The mission is designed to put the spacecraft through its paces as a final test ahead of being fully certified by NASA to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit.\n\nDuring today's launch, the Atlas V's dual first stage engines and solid state boosters worked in concert to push both launcher and spacecraft up through the densest section of Earth's atmosphere. The ULA rocket's first stage then performed a planned separation 4 minutes and 38 seconds into the mission, leaving the Centaur's upper stage to continue onwards.\n\nA mere 12 minutes into the mission, Centaur's engines shut off, having successfully pushed Starliner into its initial orbit. Three minutes after that, the Atlas V upper stage was jettisoned, leaving Starliner free to navigate to the ISS under the power of its service module.\n\nThe crew will spend the next 24 hours undergoing a series of engine burns to catch up to the ISS before finally docking with the orbital outpost's Harmony module at 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday. They will then spend around a week aboard the ISS before departing for a six-hour return journey to Earth. This stage of the mission will test Starliner's atmospheric re-entry capabilities and heat shield as it slows from an orbital velocity of 17,500 miles per hour to a mere walking speed, before gently touching down in the Western U.S. under deployed parachutes.\n\nStarliner is one of two spacecraft -- along with SpaceX's Crew Dragon -- that were tapped by NASA to bring crewed launch capabilities back to American soil in 2014 as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. One of the driving forces behind the partnerships is to provide multiple ways for the U.S. to transport astronauts between the ISS and Earth, thus ending the country's reliance on the Russian-made Soyuz spacecraft, which had been the sole method of reaching the orbital outpost following the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011.\n\nHowever, before either could be rated for human use, both Boeing and SpaceX had to complete a gauntlet of trials to prove that their spacecraft could be relied upon. NASA had initially hoped to have both spacecraft certified for crewed launches by 2017. However, a slew of development difficulties led to both SpaceX and Boeing missing the ambitious target by a number of years.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon was eventually certified for human use in November 2020. Since then, the spacecraft has completed 13 crewed missions to the ISS. During that four-year period, Starliner completed a series of uncrewed test flights that encountered a number of significant technical issues, which have combined to further delay the spacecraft's certification.\n\nWhilst the ISS remains a key part of NASA's scientific ambitions, the agency and its commercial partners are also developing a range of new technologies and spacecraft designed to extend human spaceflight to the moon and, eventually, Mars.

Other safety modifications were made to the rocket so the capsule could quickly separate in an emergency.\n\nThe capsule is a critical alternative to Space X's Crew Dragon spacecraft that is currently the only shuttle for US, European, Canadian and Japanese astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nIf NASA certifies Starliner after this test flight, Boeing is expected to begin operational flights in spring 2025.\n\nNASA commissioned both Space X and Boeing to develop a commercial crew capsule in 2014.\n\nBut while Space X started shuttling astronauts in 2020, Boeing's spacecraft has been mired in difficulties.\n\nIn its first uncrewed mission in 2019, a fault resulted in the capsule running out of fuel and docking with the ISS was aborted.\n\nA second flight in 2022 was deemed a success by NASA, despite thruster problems, paving the way for a human test flight.\n\nBut planned launches last year were scrubbed because of overheating batteries, the discovery that protective tape around wiring was flammable and potentially catastrophic problems with the parachute system used for the capsule's return to Earth.\n\nBoeing's losses on the Starliner programme are believed to be around $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn).\n\nThe company's aircraft division has also been under intense scrutiny since a disused emergency exit door blew off one of its planes shortly after take-off in January.\n\nThe US air regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, subsequently criticised the company's quality control.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors":

Boeing's Starliner capsule finally lifted off Wednesday morning on its third test flight, but the first with humans aboard.\n\nIf all goes well, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will dock at the International Space Station midday Thursday. They plan to stay for over a week, testing out the new craft's systems, workflows, and pitching in with work aboard the station.\n\nAfter they undock, they'll head home, reentering the atmosphere and parachuting to a soft landing in the New Mexico desert.\n\nThe flight was delayed by weeks and is, in fact, years behind schedule but it will still be full of notable firsts.\n\nThe first first is the most obvious but also the most important. Starliner barely survived its first uncrewed test flight back in 2019. It went so badly that Boeing paid for a second flight in 2022, which went much better but still required more adjustments.\n\nNow, with lives on the line, the pressure is even higher. Boeing competitor SpaceX debuted their Crew Dragon capsule in 2020 and has regularly been flying astronauts and even private citizens. Boeing is playing catchup and needs some good publicity as badly as NASA needs a second reliable space taxi. Should anything happen to the SpaceX Crew Dragon, the agency would have to rely on the Russians to get to the station.\n\n\"We always look for a backup,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said before the flight.\n\nThe Starliner is just the sixth American spacecraft to fly astronauts, following the giant leaps made by the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo capsules and lunar lander, the space shuttle, and SpaceX's Dragon.\n\nThe first American astronauts all blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, but by the Apollo days, that work transitioned down the road to what would become Kennedy Space Center. Since then, all NASA and commercial crew launches have taken place at KSC's Pad 39A or 39B - until Wednesday.\n\nBoeing's Starliner lifted off from Space Launch Complex 41 at what is now Cape Canaveral Space Force Station - the first crew launch from the base since Apollo 7 in 1968 and the first time humans have ever left Earth from Complex 41.\n\nThat pad has had its share of notable missions, though. NASA's Viking Mars landers blasted off from there aboard Titan rockets, as did the Voyager probes that have since left the solar system. More recently, several Mars rovers have ridden Atlas rockets from there.\n\nThe goal of this mission is to certify that the Starliner capsule is safe for human spaceflight. Assuming that happens, it will mark the first time that the U.S. has had two crew-rated spacecraft simultaneously.\n\nWhile there were some plans back in the 1960s to use Gemini capsules on military missions while the Apollo program was underway, none of it ever materialized. So the U.S. has always had just one space vehicle at any given time.\n\nNow, both the SpaceX Crew Dragon and the Boeing Starliner are simultaneously capable of carrying people to space.\n\nSuni Williams may be on her third mission, but it's the first time that a woman has flown on an American spacecraft's test flight. Every previous craft's first mission has involved all-male crews:\n\nThe Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions all ended with the astronauts slowly drifting back to Earth under parachutes, splashing down in the ocean. With the debut of the space shuttle in 1981, the term \"touchdown\" replaced \"splashdown,\" but only until the shuttles' 2011 retirement.\n\nSpaceX's Dragon capsule splashes down at sea like its 1960s predecessors, but Boeing's Starliner is designed to parachute down to White Sands in New Mexico - the site of one lone shuttle landing. When Wilmore and Williams climb out, it will be the first time that astronauts have taken those first Earthbound steps on American soil.\n\nIt won't be entirely new for this crew, though. Both astronauts have flown to the space station in Russa's Soyuz capsule, which parachutes down to a hard landing on the chilly steppes of Kazakhstan.", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_7", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (planet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5dc.com/www.fox5dc.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/GettyImages-2156205636.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It's most recent launch attempt came within minutes of sending Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on their way to the International Space Station, but was tripped up at the finish line when one of three redundant computers ran into trouble.\n\nThe problem was sourced back to what NASA described as \"a failed power distribution source, which was fixed on June 2 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) engineers. The Starliner mission management team polled 'go' to proceed towards a launch attempt on June 5 at 10:52 a.m. EDT (1452 UTC).\n\nSpaceflight Now will have live coverage of the mission beginning more than four hours prior to liftoff.\n\n\"I really appreciate all the work by the NASA, Boeing, and ULA teams over the last week,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, in a statement. \"In particular, the ULA team worked really hard to quickly learn more about these issues, keep our NASA and Boeing teams informed, and protect for this next attempt. We will continue to take it one step at a time.\"\n\nHeading into the launch attempt, the 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 90 percent chance of favorable weather at liftoff with only cumulus clouds of possible concern. With some of the sunspots that caused the recent auroras around globe reemerging this week, meteorologists are also keeping an eye on solar activity.\n\nA launch on Wednesday would set up the two-person crew to dock with the ISS a little more than 24 hours later on June 6. If all goes well with the mission, the crew will return for a landing in White Sands, New Mexico on June 14.\n\nThe launch attempt on June 5 is nearly a month after the original launch date of May 6. That launch was scuttled by an oxygen pressure relief valve on the Altas 5 rocket's upper stage. The mission stood down for weeks as teams assessed a helium leak on the Starliner's service module.\n\nComing out of a planned hold at T-minus 4 minutes during the second launch attempt, the countdown reached the T-minus 3 minutes and 50 seconds when one of the three ground launch sequencer circuit boards failed to synch with the other two, which caused the scrub.\n\nULA's President and CEO Tory Bruno said because the mission faced an instantaneous launch window, there wasn't enough time to properly assess the issue in real time to determine if a fix could be achieved before liftoff.\n\n\"The disappointment lasts for about three seconds. And then you just immediately get busy and do your job,\" Bruno said while speaking with reporters on Saturday following the scrub.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner project manager, said there was disappointment from his team as well, but that quickly turned to resilience.\n\n\"You know when you're playing a game and you get a bad call, you're a little irritated at first, or a little frustrated at first, but you immediately focus on the next pitch and that's what our teams do, they're focused on the next pitch,\" Nappi said. \"As soon as we went into the launch scrub and launch turnaround, I looked out into the control room and everybody had their heads down, working the procedures to get ready for another attempt.\"\n\nThe Crew Flight Test of Starliner comes more than four years from SpaceX launching its first astronaut missions using its Crew Dragon spacecraft. Both companies won multi-billion dollar contracts from NASA to provide transporter for its astronauts as part of the Commercial Crew Program.\n\nAfter the lunch of the Demo-2 mission, SpaceX went on to send more than 50 people to space over the course of 13 flights, 12 of which went to the ISS. Boeing is working to overcome a years-long delay due to numerous technical issues that cost the company more than $1 billion.\n\nOnce the CFT mission wraps up, Boeing will work with NASA to finish certifying Starliner for full crew rotation missions, which could begin as soon as the spring of 2025.", "source": {"uri": "spaceflightnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spaceflight Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coordinated Universal Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_Weather_Squadron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "45th Weather Squadron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Printed circuit board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory_Bruno", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory Bruno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 474, "textEnd": 480}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 613, "textEnd": 619, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1569, "textEnd": 1575}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1677, "textEnd": 1684}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1768, "textEnd": 1773}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

That alliance being a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\nPrevious Starliner launch attempts were scrubbed, first due to a valve issue with the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage and then due to a power supply problem with one of the ground computers. If today had required another scrub, there would have been an opportunity tomorrow, after which the Atlas V would require a few weeks to switch out batteries.\n\nIt has been a long journey to space for the Starliner crew, figuratively speaking. The first non-crewed launch of the spacecraft ended with the capsule being unable to reach the ISS and a near catastrophe during rocket separation.\n\nThe first attempt went so badly in fact that Boeing was forced to try again and launch a second non-crewed test, which fared somewhat better. However, there was still a lengthy delay between that launch and this first mission with humans onboard, as issues continued to crop up.\n\nIn the meantime, Boeing's rival SpaceX has continued to launch mission after mission with its Crew Dragon capsule, which first delivered astronauts to the ISS four years ago.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Starliner spacecraft, carrying veteran astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, had performed a successful orbit insertion burn. Rendezvous with the ISS is expected at around 1615 UTC on June 6, all going well.\n\nThe crew has a few more tasks to perform before hitting the sack for a period, including checking out the manual controls of the Starliner. The mission is expected to last a week before the spacecraft, dubbed Calypso, returns to Earth. If all goes well, the first operational mission, which will carry a crew of four to the ISS, should launch in early 2025.\n\nAnd no, we won't be retiring the Calamity Capsule nickname until the crew is safely back on Earth.

The successful launch now suggests NASA could have a second option, removing SpaceX's US-based monopoly on human-to-space transport.\n\nBut first, Boeing needs to prove it can get Wilmore and Williams to the ISS and back home safely. Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to dock with the ISS at 12:15 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 6.\n\nCompared to SpaceX, Boeing has been slower to break into the commercial human-space transport business. In 2014, NASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX to build spacecraft to transport its astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nSpaceX began launching astronauts in 2020, but Boeing's effort was hit with costly delays. Musk wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that Boeing's issues were due to \"too many non-technical managers.\"\n\nWednesday's launch isn't Wilmore's and Williams' first time in space. Both are seasoned astronauts and have each spent more than 150 days in space.\n\nBut this mission has been a long time coming for Wilmore and Williams. They've trained longer for this mission than Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins had for Apollo 11, The New York Times pointed out.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Collins (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buzz Aldrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sD0E3_av033g4tJiN7Wn3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/19aec78c908ecb66916f277b7f4d2381", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 358, "textEnd": 363}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 443, "textEnd": 449}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1193, "textEnd": 1199}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Other safety modifications were made to the rocket so the capsule could quickly separate in an emergency.\n\nThe capsule is a critical alternative to Space X's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is currently the only shuttle for US, European, Canadian and Japanese astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nIf NASA certifies Starliner after this test flight, Boeing is expected to begin operational flights in spring 2025.\n\nNASA commissioned both Space X and Boeing to develop a commercial crew capsule in 2014.\n\nBut while Space X started shuttling astronauts in 2020, Boeing's spacecraft has been mired in difficulties.\n\nIn its first uncrewed mission in 2019, a fault resulted in the capsule running out of fuel and docking with the ISS was aborted.\n\nA second flight in 2022 was deemed a success by NASA, despite thruster problems, paving the way for a human test flight.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nChatGPT tells users Labour has already won the election\n\nParis Hilton and CNN among accounts

It's the first time the capsule has carried astronauts after two prior uncrewed test flights.\n\nThe last scheduled launch of the CST-100 Starliner, which is years behind SpaceX in servicing the space station, was halted Saturday less than four minutes before liftoff by the ground computer that controls the final steps of the process. The problem was traced to a faulty computer power supply unit that was replaced.\n\nThe capsule was originally set to blast off May 6, but that flight was scuttled hours before liftoff because of a malfunctioning valve on the Atlas V rocket that launches it into space. The Atlas V, considered a reliable workhorse, is manufactured by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nAdditional launch dates were missed last month after a helium leak was found in the Starliner's propulsion system, which maneuvers the capsule. NASA and Boeing officials decided the leak was not serious enough to replace a defective seal, which would have taken months, and instead developed software fixes to work around it.\n\n\"For all practical purposes, SpaceX has become the player in the launch market. It's never good to have a monopoly,\" said aerospace analyst Marco Caceres of Teal Group, who applauded the flight's initial success. \"The best Boeing can hope for now is that they remain a player in this segment of the market.\"\n\nThe 15-foot diameter capsule is only the sixth spacecraft that NASA astronauts have ridden since the dawn of the space age, the first being the Project Mercury capsule and the most recent being SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nVeteran astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have previously flown to the space station, are expected to spend about a week testing the capsule before returning to Earth mid-month.\n\nThe capsule will touch down in the Arizona or New Mexico desert in a parachute ground landing pioneered by the Soviets decades ago, rather than the ocean landings typical of U.S. space flights. Ground landings make it easier to refit the reusable capsule for future missions, though Starliner also can land in water in an emergency.\n\nThe flight, also carrying 760 pounds of cargo to the space station, is critical for the Arlington, Va., aerospace company, which is far behind SpaceX in launching a crewed capsule to service the space station.\n\nBoth companies were given multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crafts, and since 2020 Elon Musk's Hawthorne company has ferried more than a half dozen crews aboard its Crew Dragon to the station - while Boeing has managed only two remote flights, including one in May 2022 that docked with the orbiting lab.\n\nThe companies were chosen by NASA after the agency has had to rely on the Russian program to send U.S. astronauts to the station when the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Assuming the Starliner mission goes well, it would then be certified to send four-person operational crews to the station for six-month missions. NASA would then have two U.S. spacecraft to service the station, but it also plans to continue to send some American astronauts via the Russian Soyuz craft.\n\nRussia and the U.S. were the primary builders of the space station, and play critical roles in keeping it aloft.\n\nBoeing has reportedly had to eat $1.5 billion in Starliner cost overruns and can ill afford a failure, especially after two crashes of its 737 Max 8 jets and the blowout of a door plug during a 737 Max 9 flight this year to Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino County.", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com",

will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the station.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n\"Wishing them best of luck!\" Musk tweeted Wednesday.\n\n- Embarrassing setbacks -\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [],

Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\"\n\nStarliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\"\n\nStarliner now has to raise itself to the orbit of the ISS, which circles the Earth at an altitude of roughly 400km (250 miles).\n\nIn the 24 hours this will take, Wilmore and Williams plan to put the vehicle through its paces, including taking manual control of the flight systems.\n\nThis mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes.\n\nStarliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade.\n\nThe most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected.\n\nRecent days have once again focussed on Starliner's readiness with the discovery of a small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system.\n\nDetailed analysis eventually led Boeing and Nasa to conclude the leak was not serious enough to hold up the launch.\n\nStarliner was developed in response to Nasa's request for commercial options to get its astronauts into space.\n\nFollowing the retirement of the famous shuttles in 2011, the agency wanted to move away from owning and operating vehicles to an arrangement where it could simply purchase the service - just like a company might outsource its IT needs or payroll.\n\nThe new approach was designed to save Nasa money it could then spend on ambitious plans to return people to the Moon.\n\nThe agency gave contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to help bring their capsules into service and then pay them for six operational missions. But whereas SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020 and then complete six operational missions by March this year, Boeing is still at the stage of the initial crew flight test.\n\nIf Starliner can prove itself over the coming days, it will join SpaceX's Dragon capsule in the routine transport of astronauts, potentially as early as the beginning of next year.\n\n\"Right now, we have one provider giving us that access to the space station,\" top Nasa official Jim Free explained. \"This will give us a second provider, which means if we have a problem with either, we have ways to get our crews to and from station, which helps keep the tempo that we've had for 23 years of having humans in low Earth orbit,\" the associate administrator said.\n\nStarliner is heading up to the space station with about 340kg (760lbs) of cargo.\n\nA key supply item is a replacement pump for the system on the ISS that purifies urine back to drinking water.\n\nMuch of the cargo, however, is simply Boeing merchandise that will become memorabilia for this important test flight.\n\nThis includes mission patches, coins, silver Snoopy pens, American flags and a hard drive with about 3,500 pieces of artwork from children across the world.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth late next week.\n\nThe Starliner is designed to come back to land, using airbags to soften contact with the ground.\n\nThere are a number of places in the US southwest where the touchdown could be performed, but mission managers will wait to see local weather forecasts before making a final choice.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

That followed several other snags over the years, with unmanned test flights in 2019 and 2022 revealing fixes that would need to be made in order for the spacecraft to be deemed safe for astronauts.\n\nIf this test flight goes smoothly, NASA is expected to certify the Starliner for routine crew rotation flights.\n\nWhile the astronauts have been tasked with testing the Starliner's various capabilities during the mission known as the Crew Flight Test, they have one other crucial objective: delivering a pump to fix the space station's urine processor assembly, which has malfunctioned and prevented the crew from being able to convert their urine into drinkable water.\n\n\"We're in a position where we have to store urine onboard Station,\" Dana Weigel, NASA's ISS program manager, said at a press conference last Friday. \"We've got bags and tanks that we've got up there for this purpose, but we've got limited inventory.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station_programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Urine_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Urine Therapy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3375,w_6000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1717603057/GettyImages-2156210384_jle0ah", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "dateEnd": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 859, "textEnd": 875}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

rocket.\n\nBoeing will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the station.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe pair of ex-Navy test pilots might have been forgiven for thinking they were stuck in Groundhog Day as they waved their goodbyes to their families on Wednesday morning and headed to the astrovan that led them to the launchpad.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n\"Wishing them best of luck!\" Musk tweeted Wednesday.\n\n- Embarrassing setbacks -\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will continue to evaluate the craft, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles an hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nia/bgs\n\nMore from this section\n\nCEOs

Following separation from the Atlas V, the Starliner engines ignited to place the crew on their orbital path to the space station.\n\n\"My congratulations and sincerest gratitude to our unrivaled team and exceptional partners on the launch of a new era in human spaceflight aboard one of the most reliable rockets in the world,\" said Tory Bruno, ULA's president and CEO. \"It's a profound honor to assist in enabling assured reliability and redundancy of crewed launches.\"\n\nMeasuring 10 feet in diameter and 41.5 feet in length, the Centaur upper stage uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to power its twin Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines. The burn of the Centaur's dual engines lasted a little more than seven minutes before engine cutoff and separation from Starliner.", "source": {"uri": "yellowhammernews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yellowhammer News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bud_mclaughlin@yellowhammernews.com", "name": "Bud McLaughlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercury-Atlas 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Space_Flight_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marshall Space Flight Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory_Bruno", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory Bruno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquid hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerojet_Rocketdyne", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerojet Rocketdyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Boeing-Starliner-e1717609901287.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

This was the third and final test for the commercial vehicle and its first crewed test to demonstrate that Starliner is a safe way to ferry astronauts to and from the space station.\n\nIt was a long road getting here. Boeing had originally planned its first crewed test in 2017 but it was postponed time and time again. The latest delay moved this crewed test from last August to May 2024. This was necessary to resolve issues with the parachute system and wiring harnesses among other less significant issues.\n\nThen the May 6 launch was scrubbed two hours before liftoff. It continued to be delayed due to a helium leak in the service module. Another attempt was planned for Saturday, June 1. The scrubbing took place just 3 minutes and 50 seconds before launch after a faulty power supply caused a computer to register a loss of redundancy.\n\nBut now Starliner is up in orbit, launched on top of the powerful Atlas V rocket.\n\nWilmore and Williams are expected to be in space for about a week. While on the ISS, Starliner will be tested as a \"safe haven\" - a protected environment within the space station that could be used in case of emergency. This will be useful in the future when the capsule will stay attached for up to seven months.\n\nThe plan is for Starliner to fly back down in the American Southwest. During the descent, it will deploy a parachute that will slow the capsule down to 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) per hour. The landing will be cushioned by the deployment of six airbags.\n\nStarliner can be reused up to 10 times and will be used just like SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, to bring people and cargo to the ISS.

Wittner is part of the class known as the \"Flies\" -- a name given to them by the \"Turtles\" class. She claims the name is because they hope to fly a lot, especially with NASA soon having two commercial vehicles in rotation.\n\nWittner is optimistic she may have a chance to fly on Starliner in the future.\n\n\"I think there's going to be many opportunities to fly here in the future with Dragon, Starliner, then of course we also have the Artemis missions,\" she said.\n\nWittner told FLORIDA TODAY that she knows the Starliner crew personally. \"Funny story. Butch used to fly in the same squadron that I flew in, because I'm also a Naval aviator test pilot. When I was in the squadron flying operationally with the Navy, we actually got to talk to Butch while he was on the space station. It's actually kind of a small world that I get to come work with him in the office.\"\n\n\"I've gotten to do a couple of events and a couple T-38 flights with Suni too,\" Wittner said. \"I know them both, and I'm very excited to see them launch today.\"\n\nFLORIDA TODAY asked Wittner about the crew's personalities. Wittner smiled before responding.\n\n\"Professional through and through, and also know how to have a good time.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\" Fincke told reporters late last week.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Now, the US space agency is making every effort to ensure a safe flight despite the setbacks.\n\nThe last launch scheduled for June 1, 2024, was scrubbed less than four minutes before liftoff as one of the ground computers flagged a technical issue in the rocket. The ULA said it has replaced the faulty computer parts that put a hold on the mission.\n\nAn earlier attempt on May 7, 2024, was postponed hours before liftoff due to a technical glitch involving a valve. \"Boeing, United Launch Alliance, and NASA scrubbed the previous launch opportunity on May 7 (India time) due to a suspect oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur second stage. Since then, teams have removed and replaced the valve, and completed an assessment of the Starliner's performance and redundancy after discovering a small helium leak in the spacecraft's service module,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nWith two launches called off, the Starliner is much delayed and way over budget.

Ten years later, it has not seen a single successful human space flight. In contrast, Space X which was given a similar contract for the development of Crew Dragon was delivered at an estimated cost of $2.6 billion. SpaceX is already ferrying astronauts to the ISS on its crew module.\n\nMs Williams, a poster girl for women aspiring to fly into space, is set to reach for the skies again in the brand-new spacecraft.

three for Boeing Starliner crewed launch attempt", "body": "Boeing will be hoping the third time's a charm on Wednesday as they try once more to launch astronauts aboard a Starliner capsule bound for the International Space Station.\n\nLiftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n- Embarrassing setbacks -\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWhen they do fly, Wilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will carry out more tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nia/st\n\nMore from this section\n\nUPDATE AND CANCELLATION - Fugitive Captured / Reward and Awareness Fundraiser for Allahnia Lenoir\n\nScientology Volunteer Ministers Honored for

A May 6 attempt was scrubbed because of a fluttering valve on the ULA rocket's upper Centaur stage, also since replaced while Boeing and NASA had to sign off on the safety of a small helium leak on Starliner's propulsion module that they ultimately decided not to fix.\n\n\"I kind of use the analogy of sports,\" said Boeing's Mark Nappi, vice president or its commercial crew program. \"You're playing a game and you get a bad call, and you're a little irritated at first, or a little frustrated at first, but you immediately focus on the next pitch. And that's what our teams do. They're focused on the next pitch.\"\n\nIf they manage to lift off, the astronauts will spend just over 24 hours making their way to the International Space Station where they will spend about eight days on board before returning to Earth for a landing in the desert in the southwestern United States.\n\nDubbed the Crew Flight Test, it's the final required mission for Boeing under NASA's Commercial Crew Program to achieve certification and set up regular rotational missions to the ISS, sharing duties with SpaceX. Wilmore and Williams will spend time on both the way up and down from the ISS testing out manual control overrides among other facets of the mostly automated spacecraft.\n\nThe flight comes just over four years since SpaceX made its first crewed flight to the ISS with its Crew Dragon spacecraft, which has since flown 13 times carrying 50 humans to space. That includes the four members of Crew-8 awaiting along with the rest of the seven-person crew of Expedition 71 aboard the ISS.\n\nISS crew members Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson recorded a message for Williams and Wilmore ahead of their last attempt to launch this past Saturday.\n\n\"We can't wait for you guys to join us here on station,\" Dyson said. \"We'll be monitoring your every move on the journey and we'll be waiting to open the hatch and welcome you to your home away from home.\"\n\n\"We know you've waited a while to get your ride aboard Starliner, but we know it will have been worth every minute,\" Epps added. \"So from all of us on the International Space Station, godspeed and we'll see you soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando

If all goes well, the Starliner and its crew will return to Earth on June 14.\n\nThe long-awaited flight marks the first launch of an Atlas 5 with astronauts aboard and the first for the Atlas family of rockets since astronaut Gordon Cooper took off on the Mercury program's final flight 61 years ago.\n\nIt also marks the first piloted flight of the Starliner, Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020.\n\nNASA ordered two spacecraft from different vendors to ensure uninterrupted transportation to and from the space station even if a problem of some sort grounded one company's ferry ship. Despite a larger NASA contract, Boeing's Starliner is four years behind SpaceX getting astronauts to space.\n\nBut Wilmore and Williams say the spacecraft is now safer and more capable thanks to numerous upgrades and fixes.\n\n\"I'm not going to say it's been easy. It's a little bit of (an) emotional roller coaster,\" Williams said before the crew's first launch attempt. But, she added, \"we knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"\n\nThe final push to orbit was held up by last-minute trouble with the Atlas 5, the Starliner and a launch pad computer system.\n\nA May 6 launch try was derailed by a suspect pressure relief valve in the Atlas 5's Centaur upper stage. The valve was replaced, but concern about a small helium leak in the Starliner's propulsion system delayed a second attempt to June 1.\n\nThe second time around, trouble with one of three ground computers used to orchestrate the final minutes of the countdown triggered another scrub. The computer hardware was replaced, clearing the way for a third launch try Wednesday.\n\nSneak peek: Who Wanted Nicki Lenway Dead?\n\nCeremony honors school mentors from New York City initiative\n\nTexas man discusses wife's miscarriage amid abortion restrictions", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cbs_news_articles_189/6696cba4b34c971f7ce098a7cc6e3ce8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 986, "textEnd": 993}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2367, "textEnd": 2372}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2597, "textEnd": 2603}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1522, "textEnd": 1530}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

It's expected to take a little over a day to reach the orbiting lab. It was the first time the capsule has carried astronauts after two prior uncrewed test flights.\n\nThe last scheduled launch of the CST-100 Starliner, which is years behind in development, was halted Saturday less than four minutes before liftoff by the ground computer that controls the final steps of the process. The problem was traced to a faulty computer power supply unit that was replaced.\n\nThe capsule was originally set to blast off May 6, but that flight was scuttled hours before liftoff because of a malfunctioning valve on the Atlas V rocket that launches it into space. The Atlas V, considered a reliable workhorse, is manufactured by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nAdditional launch dates were missed last month after a helium leak was found in the Starliner's propulsion system, which maneuvers the capsule. NASA and Boeing officials decided the leak was not serious enough to replace a defective seal, which would have taken months, and instead developed software fixes to work around it.\n\nThe 15-foot diameter capsule is only the sixth spacecraft that NASA astronauts have ridden since the dawn of the space age, the first being the Project Mercury capsule and the most recent being SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nVeteran astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have previously flown to the space station, are expected to spend about a week testing the capsule before returning to Earth mid-month.\n\nThe capsule will touch down in the Arizona or New Mexico deserts in a parachute ground landing pioneered by the Soviets decades ago, rather than the ocean landings typical of U.S. space flights. Ground landings make it easier to refit the reusable capsule for future missions, though Starliner also can land in water in an emergency.\n\nThe flight, also carrying 760 pounds of cargo to the space station, is critical for the Arlington, Va., aerospace company, which is far behind SpaceX in launching a crewed capsule to service the space station.\n\nBoth companies were given multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crafts, and since 2020 Elon Musk's Hawthorne company has ferried more than a half dozen crews aboard its Crew Dragon to the station -- while Boeing has managed only two remote flights, including one in May 2022 that docked with the orbiting lab.\n\nThe companies were chosen by NASA after the agency has had to rely on the Russian program to send U.S. astronauts to the station when the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Assuming the Starliner mission goes well, it would then be certified to send four-person operational crews to the station for six-month missions. NASA would then have two U.S. spacecraft to service the station, but it also plans to continue to send some American astronauts via the Russian Soyuz craft.\n\nRussia and the U.S. were the primary builders of the space station, and play critical roles in keeping it aloft.\n\nBoeing has reportedly had to eat $1.5 billion in Starliner cost overruns and can ill afford a failure, especially after two crashes of its 737 Max 8 jets and the blowout of a door plug during a 737 Max 9 flight this year to Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino County.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com",

The Pilot is Indian Origin astronaut Sunita Williams while the Commander is Butch Wilmore. Sunita Williams named the ship Calypso, after the research vessel of Jacques Cousteau. The flight took place despite a very minor leak in the helium tank in the support module, which engineers assessed posed no risk to the flight. The crewed test flight took place two years after an uncrewed Boeing Starliner docked with the ISS, in May 2022.\n\nThe two astronauts entered into the crew module three hours before the flight. Wilmore got in first and was strapped in by ground support staff in his captain's seat. Williams entered the capsule second, with a seat closer to the door. The whole process took about 20 minutes. The aluminium seats were designed to accommodate astronauts of height between 4 feet 11 inches and 6 feet 4 inches. Williams and Wilmore gave feedback on the seat design during the development of the capsule, making it more comfortable. The pre-launch proceedings were completed much ahead of schedule.\n\nThe visual zero gravity indicator on the flight was a glittery stuffed toy of a Narwhal, coincidentally, also named Calypso. The stuffed toy appears to levitate when the Starliner reaches the microgravity environment of Earth orbit. A cabin pressure test was conducted after the hatch was closed, about two hours before liftoff. The weather conditions were clear, and conducive for a launch. The countdown proceeded smoothly with the ground teams having thoroughly practiced on the procedures.\n\nAt 20:23 hours IST, the Boeing Starliner lifted off successfully on top of the ULA Atlas V. The spacecraft will now conduct a series of manoeuvres in space to test various systems and subsystems on Starliner, before docking with the ISS, at around 21:45\u202fhours tomorrow, in the forward facing port of the Harmony Module.\n\nThe primary goal of the flight is to validate the entire transport system, but the mission is doubling up as a cargo mission as well, ferrying 344 kg of cargo to the ISS. More than half of this is Boeing stuff, including mission patches, coins, pins and American flags. There was also a hard drive filled with 3,500 artworks from children around the world, as part of a Space Foundation outreach activity. A last-minute addition was a new pump for the urine processing assembly on board the ISS, that recovers most of the water. The technology will be essential for future missions to the Moon and Mars.\n\nTwo non-essential cargo bags were swapped out to accommodate the pump. There were also tools and equipment in the cargo. NASA is sending up exercise gear, clothes, medical supplies, along with things the crew wanted to bring with them. The Starliner will return with 340 kg of cargo, a little less, including an empty nitrogen-oxygen ressuply system tank (NORS), which will be refilled for future missions. These tanks replenish the necessary gases in the airlocks during spacewalks, as well as the ISS itself.\n\nThe launch has been delayed multiple times because of irregularities in the pre-launch procedures. The flight was originally supposed to take place on 7 May, because of a malfunctioning valve in the centaur upper stage. The busted valve was swapped out, with the launch rescheduled for 17 May. However, a leak was identified in the helium tank of the support module, which caused the launch to be deferred to 21 May. The ground teams assessed that the leak did not pose a risk for the flight, clearing a launch for 25 May.\n\nThe helium leak was stabilised, but the ground teams pushed the launch to 1 June, to conduct a propulsion system assessment, to better understand how the helium system impacted the return scenarios for the Starliner. Helium is not flammable and non-toxic, and the leak was only in one flange of 28 reaction control systems on board the Starliner. Space Shuttles have launched with similar leaks before, and the ground teams developed contingency plans for re-entry burns if the leak grows in size, or nearby reaction control systems (RCS) also develop a leak. A flight readyness review was also conducted before the launch, which was scheduled for 1 June.\n\nThe second launch attempt took place on 1 June. Both the astronauts entered the spaceship. The ULA ground teams reacted quickly to fix a snag in the topping valve that replenished the oxygen and helium tanks, as well as a suit fan malfunction that caused the astronauts to unzip their flexible visors, which replaced the bulky hard helmets with metal rings. However, just four miutes before liftoff, a six second delay in an expected signal in the ground launch sequencer put the launch on automated hold. The teams decided to scrub the launch, and forgo the launch opportunity on June 2. Such delays are common for brand new hardware.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner is meant to ferry a crew of four to the ISS, which is the size of a standard crew rotation, but can accommodate more. For the test flight, there are only two astronauts on board. This is the first time that a crewed Boeing Starliner is flying to the ISS. On return, it will also be the first American mission to the ISS return to land. All other American missions to the ISS has ended with an ocean splashdown. Boeing opted for a ground landing to simplify the recovery operations. Williams will also be the first woman piloting an orbital craft on a test flight.\n\nThis was also the first flight of the Atlas family of rockets in 61 years. The ninth and final Mercury-Atlas flight took place on 15 May, 1963. This was only the sixth time that NASA astronauts flew the test flight of an orbital vehicle after Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the Space Shuttle and the SpaceX Dragon. After the successful completion of the mission, NASA will initiate the final process of certifying the entire transport system for crew rotations to the ISS.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner is meant to be an alternative to the SpaceX Dragon, which has been carrying out the crew rotations for the American side after the retirement of the Space Shuttle, and a brief period of reliance on Russian Soyuz missions. The Boeing Starliner relies heavily on automation, with machines doing the work that previously required close coordination between the commander, the pilot and ground crew. If the situation demands it, the design allows for the crew to take over command of the capsule, which will be demonstrated in proximity with the ISS.\n\nThe Starliner has a simplified console with only 85 switches and indicators, while the Shuttle had thousands. The Starliner can be flown by a crew of one. There console on the Shuttle practically required a degree to understand and operate. The console has been made more similar to an aeroplane, as the crew are experienced pilots. Williams and Wilmore, both veteran astronauts, provided feedback to the engineers during the design and development of the Starliner. They also developed the training procedures for the brand new hardware.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Starliner separated from the Centaur upper stage 15 minutes after liftoff and completed an orbital insertion burn with its own thrusters 16 minutes later, placing the spacecraft into low Earth.\n\nOn board Starliner are NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. The spacecraft is scheduled to dock with the International Space Station at about 12:15 p.m. Eastern June 6. The spacecraft will remain at the station for at least eight days before undocking, landing several hours later in the southwestern United States.\n\nIn addition to Wilmore and Williams, Starliner has about 360 kilograms of cargo on board. That includes a new pump for a urine reprocessing system on the International Space Station added to the spacecraft last week after the existing pump on the station failed. The 70-kilogram pump is taking the place of two suitcases of clothes and hygiene supplies.\n\nThis was the third launch attempt for the CFT mission. The first attempt May 6 was scrubbed about two hours before the scheduled liftoff when an oxygen relief valve in the Centaur upper stage started oscillating. ULA rolled the rocket back to its integration building to replace the valve.\n\nWhile that work was underway, Boeing investigated a helium leak in one thruster in Starliner's service module. The company and NASA concluded that the thruster could fly as-is, but in that process discovered what the agency called a \"design vulnerability\" in the spacecraft's propulsion system that required development of a new backup modeto ensure the spacecraft could perform a deorbit burn should a rare combination of failures occur.\n\nThe second CFT launch attempt June 1 was halted a little less than four minutes before liftoff. ULA determined that a power supply in a ground computer rack malfunctioned, and replaced and retested that system. That work pushed the launch back to June 5.\n\nThe launch comes after years of development delays with the spacecraft, which suffered problems ranging from faulty software and corroded valves to parachute components with inadequate safety margins and flammable tape used in spacecraft wiring. Those problems required Boeing to fly two uncrewed test flights rather than one as originally planned.\n\nBoeing received a $4.2 billion fixed-price contract in September 2014 to complete development of Starliner and fly six operational missions to ferry crews to and from the ISS. SpaceX, which received a $2.6 billion contract at the same for its Crew Dragon spacecraft, launched its first crewed mission, Demo-2, in May 2020. The company is now on its eighth operational mission to the ISS.", "source": {"uri": "spacenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_foust@spacenews.com", "name": "Jeff Foust", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_insertion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit insertion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Fluid_Handling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Fluid Handling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cft-liftoff2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 289, "textEnd": 295, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 703, "textEnd": 709}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1287, "textEnd": 1292}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1975, "textEnd": 1981}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-09-", "textStart": 2606, "textEnd": 2620}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 2864, "textEnd": 2872}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

"body": "Liftoff is targeted for 10:52 am (1452 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, for a roughly one-week stay at the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe last attempt, on Saturday, was dramatically aborted with less than four minutes left of the countdown as the ground launch computer went into an automatic hold.\n\nThe problem was later traced to a faulty power supply source connected to the computer, with the malfunctioning unit since replaced.\n\nAnd a buzzy valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scuppered a previous attempt on May 6, a few hours before launch.\n\nIn both cases, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were strapped in and ready to go, only to be forced to return to strict quarantine in their quarters.\n\nThe Starliner program has already been beset by years of safety scares and delays, and a successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nNASA meanwhile is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to the ISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.\n\n- Embarrassing setbacks -\n\nBoth companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.\n\nBoeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored, but its program fell badly behind.\n\nSetbacks ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nWhile teams worked to replace the faulty rocket valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of Starliner's thrusters came to light.\n\nRather than replace the seal, which would require taking the spaceship apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.\n\nWhen they do fly, Wilmore and Williams will be charged with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft on its way to the ISS.\n\nDuring their stay on the research platform, the crew will carry out more tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems on the orbital outpost.\n\nAfter undocking, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.", "source":

The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up, and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday\u2019s launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft\u2019s propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s been a long road to get here,\u201d Nasa\u2019s commercial crew programme manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX a decade ago to ferry Nasa\u2019s astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing US companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles\u2019 retirement, paying US$4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries \u2013 Russia, the US and China \u2013 had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for Nasa and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe lift-off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn\u2019s Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V\u2019s perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of Nasa and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing\u2019s Starliner and SpaceX\u2019s Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, Nasa will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner\u2019s next trip.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and this has been a great exercise,\u201d Fincke told reporters late last week.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It has run into several delays and glitches in its developmental process. The spacecraft has flown twice to the Space Station, both uncrewed missions.\n\nAstronaut Sunita Williams, who is piloting the spacecraft, and Willmore, the flight commander for the mission, are seasoned space travellers, and were part of the Shuttle missions to space. The two astronauts were to dock the Starliner spacecraft with the Space Station after a 24-hour-long flight on Sunday.\n\nThe launch was scrubbed on June 1, just four minutes before lift-off, when the ground launch sequencer failed to load properly. Previous attempts in May were aborted due to a faulty oxygen relief valve and a helium leak in the service module.\n\nIf successful, the Starliner capsule will reach the ISS after approximately 26 hours and dock with the orbiting research outpost around 250 miles above Earth. Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to remain at the station for roughly a week before returning to Earth via the Starliner for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US southwestern desert - a first for crewed Nasa missions.\n\nThe spacecraft could play a crucial role for Nasa in transporting astronauts to and from the Space Station. So far, Nasa, which has transferred the transportation role to private companies, is dependent on the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.\n\nStarliner is a reusable crew capsule developed by Boeing as part of Nasa's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nIt is designed to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station, providing a safe and reliable means of human spaceflight. The capsule can accommodate up to seven passengers and features an innovative weldless structure, wireless internet, and tablet technology for crew interfaces.\n\nStarliner is equipped with a pusher abort system for crew escape during launch and ascent.

If the flight were to pass this last technical hurdle, a trip with astronauts aboard could take place within months.\n\nThe Atlas V rocket launched flawlessly, releasing Starliner.\n\nAnd then the mission immediately went awry.\n\nThe spacecraft's clock was set to the wrong time, making Starliner think it was in the wrong location. The capsule fired its thrusters to try to get to where it thought it should be. At the same time, a communications glitch thwarted efforts by flight controllers at mission control to diagnose and fix the problem.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/05/multimedia/05boeing-starliner-problems-01-zghw/05boeing-starliner-problems-01-zghw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-20", "textStart": 401, "textEnd": 414}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 351, "textEnd": 364}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Despite Boeing's century-long history, its program has lagged behind.\n\nWhile fixing the faulty rocket valve from the previous attempt, a small helium leak was found in one of Starliner's thrusters. Rather than dismantle the spacecraft to replace the seal, Nasa and Boeing decided it was safe enough to proceed.\n\nSetbacks for Boeing have included a software bug that sent the spaceship off course during its first uncrewed test and the discovery of flammable electrical tape in the cabin after the second test.\n\nOnce launched, Wilmore and Williams will rigorously test Starliner, including manual control during the journey to the ISS. During their stay, they will conduct more tests to evaluate if the spacecraft can serve as a safe haven during emergencies on the ISS.\n\nThe mission will conclude with Starliner's re-entry into the atmosphere and a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

If all goes well, the Starliner and its crew will return to Earth on June 14.\n\nThe long-awaited flight marks the first launch of an Atlas 5 with astronauts aboard and the first for the Atlas family of rockets since astronaut Gordon Cooper took off on the Mercury program's final flight 61 years ago.\n\nIt also marks the first piloted flight of the Starliner, Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020.\n\nNASA ordered two spacecraft from different vendors to ensure uninterrupted transportation to and from the space station even if a problem of some sort grounded one company's ferry ship. Despite a larger NASA contract, Boeing's Starliner is four years behind SpaceX getting astronauts to space.\n\nBut Wilmore and Williams say the spacecraft is now safer and more capable thanks to numerous upgrades and fixes.\n\n\"I'm not going to say it's been easy. It's a little bit of (an) emotional roller coaster,\" Williams said before the crew's first launch attempt. But, she added, \"we knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"\n\nThe final push to orbit was held up by last-minute trouble with the Atlas 5, the Starliner and a launch pad computer system.\n\nA May 6 launch try was derailed by a suspect pressure relief valve in the Atlas 5's Centaur upper stage. The valve was replaced, but concern about a small helium leak in the Starliner's propulsion system delayed a second attempt to June 1.\n\nThe second time around, trouble with one of three ground computers used to orchestrate the final minutes of the countdown triggered another scrub.

Atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft jumped off the launch pad and into the sky, letting off a loud rumble as it soared into the sky.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, the crowd erupted into cheers as the rocket disappeared behind a cloud. Starliner was on its way to the International Space Station, carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams -- a moment which many had waited nearly a month to see.\n\nOriginally set to launch on May 6, the inaugural crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner was scrubbed due to an oxygen valve on the Atlas V rocket, and then later delayed due to a helium leak coming from a thruster on the spacecraft. Crews attempted a launch again on Saturday, June 1, yet the countdown was stopped with just under four minutes to liftoff due to a malfunctioning ground launch computer.\n\nThis time was a different story. At 10:52 a.m. on Wednesday, Starliner bolted off of Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Test pilots turned NASA astronauts Williams and Wilmore are set to test all aspects of the spacecraft as part of the certification process required before Starliner can join the regular rotation of ferrying NASA astronauts to the station alongside SpaceX's Dragon.\n\nAt KSC's Visitor Complex, crowds gather to watch history take place. After erupting into cheers, most stayed to watch the rocket as it disappeared into the sky. Excited chatter filled the crowd at the Apollo Saturn V Center.\n\nNext Launch: Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA, ULA rocket launch schedule in Florida\n\nBarbara Kerrigan had come up from Hutchinson Island on Saturday to witness this historic launch, only to be disappointed. She said she's gotten more interested in what is happening within the space industry with the increasing number of launches over the past year. Typically, she watches Starlink watches from her home, yet with this being a crewed launch, she knew she had to be at the Visitor Complex.\n\n\"I prayed for it, because of what has happened in the past,\" said Kerrigan with 10 minutes to go until the launch of Starliner. \"It's exciting, but I just want to know it gets there.\"\n\nGabriel Cornell-Webb, 14, sat with his father as he waited to see Starliner finally lift off. They came from St. Johns to see the event up close. \"I'm excited. I'm just hoping it actually does launch,\" said Cornell-Webb before adding how crewed launches are a rare sight to catch.\n\nCornell-Webb said he plans to work in aerospace engineering specializing in propulsion.\n\nDayton Zeigler, 11, aimed his camera at the Atlas V rocket off in the distance. He's seen launches from a distance but never this close, he said.\n\n\"I want to try to get photos of it,\" Dayton said quietly. \"I like photography a lot.\"\n\nMyles Spillers, 15, was present with his family to witness the launch. They'd gotten lucky; the family is in Florida on vacation from Illinois, and the trip just happened to coincide with Starliner's launch.\n\n\"I'm glad that it got pushed back because now we're in lorida watching it live,\" said Spillers, who is interested in astrophysics. He said he plans to study mechanical engineering and minor in aerospace in his future college studies.\n\nBe sure to follow the FLORIDA TODAY Space Team at floridatoday.com/space for the latest updates from the Space Coast.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

If successful, it will make Starliner the second private spacecraft after SpaceX's Crew Dragon to transport astronauts to and from the orbiting laboratory.\n\nFor Williams, a veteran of two previous space shuttle missions totaling 322 days in orbit, this flight marks another pioneering milestone in her trailblazing career.\n\nShe previously set records for most spacewalks (7) and spacewalk time (50 hours, 40 minutes) by a woman during her expeditions aboard the ISS in 2006-2007 and 2012.\n\nThe Starliner capsule will attempt to dock with the ISS around 26 hours after liftoff, carrying Williams, Wilmore and over 500 pounds of cargo for the orbiting outpost.\n\nThe two astronauts are scheduled to spend about a week aboard the station, conducting tests and validating Starliner's systems before returning to Earth for a parachute-assisted landing in the western United States.\n\nWilliams' achievement is particularly poignant given her Indian-Slovenian heritage. Born to an Indian-American father from Gujarat and a Slovenian-American mother, she has celebrated her multicultural roots by carrying Indian and Slovenian items during her previous spaceflights.\n\nAs Williams and Wilmore continue operations aboard the ISS, their pioneering mission aboard Starliner marks a significant step in expanding humanity's access to space through commercial partnerships.\n\nIt also cements Williams' legacy as one of the most accomplished women in the history of space exploration.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Americans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timeline of space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/sunita-williams-051527258-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=dFPt36Nzhj.0T0g066BfD_s1d18_QiZF", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 304, "textEnd": 310}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

They are scheduled to dock with the ISS shortly after noon on Thursday, and if the eigh-to-10-day mission is successful, Starliner will give Nasa a second privately owned option for ferrying humans to lower Earth orbit alongside SpaceX's Dragon capsule.\n\nBill Nelson, the agency's administrator and former space shuttle astronaut, hailed what he said was \"a special moment\".\n\n\"This is another milestone in this extraordinary history of Nasa,\" he told a post-launch press conference. \"The whole team went through a lot of trial and tribulation. But they had perseverance.\n\n\"With Dragon and Starliner, the US is going to have two unique human space transportation systems. We always like to have a backup that makes it safer for our astronauts.\n\n\"That's why we started the commercial crew program [CCP] in the first place, partnering with US companies to deliver safe and reliable spaceflight at the same time of cutting the cost. When we expand our fleet of spacecraft, what we're doing is expanding our reach to the stars.\"\n\nThe launch also gave a welcome lift to Boeing. Although space operations are conducted independently of its aviation wing, executives will be pleased the company's name is attached to some good news following a recent series of safety and quality issues.\n\n\"The whole company has rallied around us. I get emotional talking about it,\" Aaron Kraftcheck, senior manager for Starliner's flight software, design and development, told reporters in April.\n\nNasa has ordered from Boeing a further six astronaut rotation flights to the space station as part of the CCP. Each capsule can be flown up to 10 times, Boeing says, with a six-month turnaround between each mission.\n\nThe hi-tech Starliner capsule, officially called CST-100 (crew space transportation), is designed to totally transform how astronauts fly in space. Its autonomous flight, navigation and course-correct systems make Williams and Wilmore effectively only passengers, although they can step in to take over manually if required.\n\nInnovation includes a weldless design, which reduces the risk of structural failure, and interior space similar to a midsize SUV. Starliner can carry up to seven humans, but will be configured for four astronauts and cargo for space station flights.\n\nToday's crew both have extensive spaceflight experience, having spent more than 500 days in orbit between them on previous space shuttle and ISS missions. With Wednesday's launch from Cape Canaveral space force station aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, Williams became the first female to fly in an orbital test vehicle.\n\n\"Butch and Suni bring a lot to the table in terms of helping us as a team get to a place where we're ready to go fly. They've been very integral to the process for years, and all of that culminates with this one,\" LeRoy Cain, manager of mission integration and operations for Boeing's commercial crew program, and a former Nasa flight director, told Nasa TV.\n\nCain was flight director during the 2002 Columbia space shuttle disaster, which killed seven astronauts, and he said safety was an overriding priority.\n\n\"Exploring space is not for the faint of heart. It has the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. It's very unforgiving [and] the margins are small. I expect it to be a very successful flight test. I think we'll learn some things, we learn every time we fly. And that's part of the beauty of this business, part of why we were so drawn to the exploration of space.\"\n\nWilmore, in a short speech from Starliner's flight deck immediately before launch, paid tribute to the hundreds of Nasa and Boeing employees who worked on the mission, and the 450 suppliers from 37 states that contributed.\n\n\"[They are] people who use their gifts and talents for the common good, are passionate,\" he said.\n\n\"We all know that when the going gets tough, and it often does, the tough get going, and Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeRoy_E._Cain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeRoy E.

See you at home,\" wrote Bill Nelson, NASA administrator in a post he made on his X account, along with the video of the launch.\n\nThe first stage of the rocket has already separated from the device where the astronauts travel.

That mission was a partial failure as it was not able to rendezvous with the ISS forcing a 2 1/2-year delay to Boeing's program to remedy hardware, software and management issues. The second uncrewed test flight in 2022 made it to the ISS, but post-launch review and preparation for the CFT brought further delays with more hardware issues popping up.\n\nBut half a decade later, Williams and Wilmore were set to fly, entering quarantine on April 22. Finally, on May 6, they tried for the first time to take off from the Space Coast, but an issue with a fluttering valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage scrubbed that attempt with about two hours to go on the countdown clock. Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" said NASA astronaut for future Starliner crew member Mike Fincke during NASA's live commentary leading up to launch. \"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nIn the end, the third attempt went smoothly.\n\n\"Everything was fine. No hiccups, no drama and nothing to worry about,\" Fincke said. \"So I was really happy for Butch and Suni and happy with the whole team. ... Now we just got to get to space station.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building venturing out after 7:30 a.m. to climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral and make their way back on board the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nBefore driving over, they played a traditional prelaunch game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba -- this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The idea is that losing that game is the worst thing that happens on a launch day.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Countdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Acaba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph M.

(Image credit: United Launch Alliance)\n\nSpaceX bigwigs celebrated the arrival of a new American capsule on the human-spaceflight scene today (June 5).\n\nSpaceX's president and chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, shared similar, slightly more verbose sentiments in an X post of her own: \"Congratulations to @NASA, @BoeingSpace and @ULAlaunch on this morning's launch to the @space_station, and Godspeed to Butch, Suni and Starliner on your flight!\"\n\nRelated: Boeing Starliner 1st astronaut flight: Live updates\n\nStarliner is scheduled to reach the ISS tomorrow (June 6) around 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT). You can watch that milestone here on Space.com, courtesy of NASA.\n\nThe capsule, Wilmore and Williams will remain at the orbiting lab for about a week, then head back home to Earth to wrap up the mission, which is known as Crew Flight Test (CFT). If all goes well, Starliner will be certified to fly six-month astronaut missions to and from the ISS for NASA -- something SpaceX already does.\n\nBoeing and SpaceX both got multibillion-dollar contracts from NASA's Commercial Crew Program back in 2014 to provide this astronaut-ferrying service. SpaceX launched its version of CFT, known as Demo-2, in May 2020 and is now in the middle of its eighth operational, long-duration crewed mission for the agency.\n\nStarliner's road has been far bumpier. The capsule failed to meet up with the ISS on its first uncrewed test flight back in December 2019, for example. And issues with the capsule's parachute system and wiring (much of which was wrapped in flammable tape) caused further delays.\n\nIt's easy to frame the SpaceX-Boeing situation as a race -- one that Musk's company is winning handily. But NASA doesn't see things that way, according to agency chief Bill Nelson.\n\n\"When we expand our fleet of spacecraft, what we're doing is expanding our reach to the stars,\" Nelson said in a postlaunch news conference today. \"So this is a special moment. It's another one of those great markers in history.\"\n\nBoeing representatives also downplayed the competition angle, sending positive vibes back in SpaceX's direction.\n\n\"We don't see it as a competition,\" Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, said during today's news conference. \"I sit on my front porch and I watch every SpaceX mission, and I root for them, too.

They are scheduled to dock with the ISS on Thursday, and if the eight- to 10-day mission is successful, Starliner will give Nasa a second option for ferrying humans to lower earth orbit after SpaceX's Dragon capsule.\n\n\"This is a truly historic day,\" Jim Free, Nasa's associate administrator, said.\n\n\"Right now we have one provider giving us that access to the space station. This will give us a second provider ... if we have a problem with either we have ways to get our crews to and from the station, which helps keep the tempo that we've had for 23 years of having humans in low earth orbit.\"\n\nThe launch also gave a welcome lift to Boeing. Although space operations are conducted independently of its aviation wing, executives will be pleased the company's name is attached to some good news following a recent series of safety and quality issues.\n\n\"The whole company has rallied around us. I get emotional talking about it,\" Aaron Kraftcheck, senior manager for Starliner's flight software, design and development, told reporters in April.\n\nNasa has ordered from Boeing a further six astronaut rotation flights to the space station as part of its commercial crew program. Each capsule can be flown up to 10 times, Boeing says, with a six-month turnaround between each mission.\n\nThe hi-tech Starliner capsule, officially called CST-100 (crew space transportation), is designed to totally transform how astronauts fly in space. Its autonomous flight, navigation and course-correct systems make Williams and Wilmore effectively only passengers, although they can step in to take over manually if required.\n\nInnovation includes a weldless design, which reduces the risk of structural failure, and interior space similar to a midsize SUV. Starliner can carry up to seven humans, but will be configured for four astronauts and cargo for space station flights.\n\nToday's crew both have extensive spaceflight experience, having spent more than 500 days in orbit between them on previous space shuttle and ISS missions. With Wednesday's launch from Cape Canaveral space force station aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, Williams became the first female to fly in an orbital test vehicle.\n\n\"Butch and Suni bring a lot to the table in terms of helping us as a team get to a place where we're ready to go fly. They've been very integral to the process for years, and all of that culminates with this one,\" LeRoy Cain, manager of mission integration and operations for Boeing's commercial crew program, and a former Nasa flight director, told Nasa TV.\n\nCain was flight director during the 2002 Columbia space shuttle disaster, which killed seven astronauts, and he said safety was an overriding priority.\n\n\"Exploring space is not for the faint of heart. It has the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. It's very unforgiving [and] the margins are small. I expect it to be a very successful flight test. I think we'll learn some things, we learn every time we fly. And that's part of the beauty of this business, part of why we were so drawn to the exploration of space.\"\n\nWilmore, in a short speech from Starliner's flight deck immediately before launch, paid tribute to the hundreds of Nasa and Boeing employees who worked on the mission, and the 450 suppliers from 37 states that contributed.\n\n\"[They are] people who use their gifts and talents for the common good, are passionate,\" he said.\n\n\"We all know that when the going gets tough, and it often does, the tough get going, and Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_luscombe@theguardian.com", "name": "Richard Luscombe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle Columbia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a321a5e443d4ed3675abebce902f15910ddfa8ef/0_215_3854_2312/master/3854.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5ac66655fd61296d77ba463c0e13082f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

That mission was a partial failure as it was not able to rendezvous with the ISS forcing a 2 1/2-year delay to Boeing's program to remedy hardware, software and management issues. The second uncrewed test flight in 2022 made it to the ISS, but post-launch review and preparation for the CFT brought further delays with more hardware issues popping up.\n\nBut half a decade later, Williams and Wilmore were set to fly, entering quarantine on April 22. Finally, on May 6, they tried for the first time to take off from the Space Coast, but an issue with a fluttering valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage scrubbed that attempt with about two hours to go on the countdown clock. Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" said NASA astronaut for future Starliner crew member Mike Fincke during NASA's live commentary leading up to launch. \"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building venturing out after 7:30 a.m. to climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral and make their way back on board the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nBefore driving over, they played a traditional prelaunch game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba -- this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

If the eight- to 10-day mission is successful, Starliner will give Nasa a second option for ferrying humans to low Earth orbit after SpaceX's Dragon capsule", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33c0cb8453a2ad482205eee05f62b717443918aa/131_0_3938_2363/master/3938.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3148ebdb18bae87c78fb6043385fad26", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nAfter a month of delays, Boeing and NASA's crew flight test (CFT) mission for the Starliner spacecraft finally took to the skies from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida earlier today. Starliner CFT is the first crewed flight for Boeing's ship that has been contracted by NASA to take crew to the International Space Station (ISS). If its mission is successful, then it will join SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft as the second American ship capable of crewed missions from U.S. soil.\n\nFlying the ship are NASA astronauts Butch Willmore and Suni Williams. Both are human spaceflight veterans and have spent hundreds of days in space. Williams is the more experienced astronaut, and her collective missions have seen the Ohio native spend more than three hundred days in space. Her last mission was in 2012, and according to a presenter in the live stream today, Williams had cried when she left space back then.\n\nMore than a decade later the astronauts are headed to space after having to spend a patient few weeks in quarantine. Crew destined for space are isolated from humans on Earth to prevent any contamination inside the strictly controlled ISS environment. Williams and Wilmore have been waiting to fly for more than a month now and have been in quarantine throughout multiple CFT delays.\n\nThe launch itself was a picture perfect affair, and the Atlas V successfully crossed the point of maximum dynamic pressure close to a minute after lift off. The rocket's solid boosters shut down a little over two minutes into the flight, and footage from the live stream showed the curvature of the Earth in the background after the boosters jettisoned three minutes into the flight.\n\nA little over five minutes after launch, the second stage Centaur's engines lit up to continue the journey. At this point, the Starliner's protective cover for the forward hatch also separated from the ship. Wilmore and Williams will spend a little over a day inside the ship before they dock at the station. During docking, the forward hatch connects to the ISS to allow the astronauts to move between the two vehicles.\n\nAfter docking, the astronauts will spend a week in space before they return to Earth. During the flight, Boeing had programmed several abort modes into Starliner that would guide the ship to specific landing sites depending on its position. Unlike SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which can only land in water, Starliner's primary landing profile is geared for a land landing. The ship can also land in the water, and a land landing speeds up the time for crew access.\n\nThe delays also allowed NASA to ship crucial components for the ISS's water filtration system. Along with these, the astronauts are taking other cargo to space, including food, medical supplies, tools and other items. A successful CFT and a subsequent Starliner human rating will see the ship spend months in space. Spacecraft are limited by their systems, such as solar panels, when it comes to mission duration, and SpaceX's Dragon often spends six months docked with the ISS.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramish_zafar@wccftech.com", "name": "Ramish Zafar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_q", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_abort_modes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle abort modes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CFT-ASTRONAUTS-STARLINER-JUNE-5-2024.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\"Starliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\" Starliner now has to raise itself to the orbit of the ISS, which circles the Earth at an altitude of roughly 400km (250 miles).In the 24 hours this will take, Wilmore and Williams plan to put the vehicle through its paces, including taking manual control of the flight systems.This mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes.Starliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade.The most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected.Recent days have once again focussed on Starliner's readiness with the discovery of a small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system.Detailed analysis eventually led Boeing ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft propulsion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Boeing built the spacecraft. It's called the Starliner.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Three, two, one, ignition and lift-off of Starliner and Atlas V, carrying two American heroes.\n\nMARTIN: On board are NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. They are headed to the International Space Station. Today's launch came after years of delays. Joining us to talk about this milestone is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Geoff, welcome.\n\nMARTIN: So tell me about these delays. Why did it take so long for today's launch to happen?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. I mean, Starliner's had problems right from the start. Way back in 2019, before the pandemic, it had its first uncrewed test flight. And an improperly set clock aboard the spacecraft caused its engines to fire too early, so it couldn't reach the proper orbit. It never made it to the space station, where it was supposed to go, and it had to come home early.\n\nIt's second test flight also had problems. They found issues with the parachutes, which are obviously pretty important for landing. They also found that engineers had used potentially flammable tape onboard the spacecraft to wrap up all the wires. They had to replace all that tape. There are a lot of wires on a spaceship, so that took a long time.\n\nNow they've been trying for weeks, and they've called off the launch twice before this, first for stuck valve, then for a computer glitch. Finally, finally, today, it all came together. It took off with everything except the astronauts' suitcases.\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. This is like the final summer travel sort of injustice. Basically, the space station's urine recycling system broke last week. They had to put in a spare pump. But, you know, you'd rather have a toilet, I suppose, than space in your suitcases.\n\nMARTIN: OK, but I am going to worry about how they're going to change their clothes, but I'll just keep that thought. So this is Starliner's first flight with people inside. Can you just tell us a little bit more about the spacecraft?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. It's a gumdrop-shaped capsule about the size of a midsized SUV on the inside. It's a throwback to what you might have seen in the Apollo era, but obviously updated. This is one of two capsules NASA's developed with private companies to go to the space station. The other one is SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Dragon actually had its first test flight in 2020 and now regularly flies to the station, and it also costs less than Starliner to develop.\n\nMARTIN: Geoff, I do think it's fair to ask, though, given all the problems that Boeing has had with its airplanes lately, is NASA sure this is safe?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. I mean, Boeing is an enormous company. The space division is completely separate from the aviation division, and spacecraft are obviously held to a different standard. Hundreds of Boeing and NASA engineers have been looking over this thing for years to make sure it works, and it appeared to today. That being said, at least one analyst I spoke to said there is a connection. You know Boeing's quality control for Starliner is clearly not as good as it should be, similar to what's happened in the aviation division, but it's caused delays, not necessarily, you know, doors to fall off the spaceship or anything like that.\n\nBRUMFIEL: Well, the astronauts are going to spend about a day flying to the station. Most of that'll be on autopilot, but they'll also switch it off autopilot and try driving it around a little bit, you know, piloting it manually just to make sure it works. Once they've docked to station, they'll stay there for about a week, running various tests on the Starliner. And then they're going to come back and land somewhere in the Western United States using those parachutes, which, hopefully, all the kinks are worked out, and they come down, no problem.\n\nMARTIN: OK.

It can fit up to seven people, though NASA crews typically will number four. The company settled on the name Starliner nearly a decade ago, a twist on the name of Boeing's early Stratoliner and the current Dreamliner planes.\n\nNo one was aboard Boeing's two previous Starliner test flights. The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn't reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed. Wednesday's launch was the third try with astronauts; two earlier countdowns were scuttled by rocket-related issues.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago. They joined the test flight after the original crew bowed out as the delays piled up.

The May 6 attempt was scrubbed two hours before liftoff because of valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage that teams continue to investigate. Teams deemed the valve needed to be replaced and the rocket needed to be rolled back from the pad to Boeing's Vertical Integration Facility.

If all goes well, the Starliner and its crew will return to Earth on June 14.\n\nThe long-awaited flight marks the first launch of an Atlas 5 with astronauts aboard and the first for the Atlas family of rockets since astronaut Gordon Cooper took off on the Mercury program's final flight 61 years ago.\n\nRead more: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-starliner-launch-first-piloted-test-flight-space/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 962, "textEnd": 969}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

More than 520 RL10 engines have flown in space. The RL10 is fueled by cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and employs a closed expander cycle that makes it highly efficient and reliable.\n\n\"The engine's demonstrated performance and reliability make it well suited to carry the most precious cargo there is - human beings - as we saw during this mission and will see next year with Artemis II, the second launch of SLS,\" added Houston. \"Artemis II will send astronauts deeper into space than any humans since Apollo.\"\n\nThe human spaceflight chapter of the RL10's rich history began as ULA's Atlas V launched from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Following the boost phase of the flight, twin RL10 engines on the launch vehicle's Centaur upper stage, each generating 22,300 pounds of thrust, ignited to send Starliner and its two-person crew on the way to the International Space Station.\n\n\"It's not often that a program that has been in production for more than six decades has an opportunity to mark a new milestone,\" Houston continued. \"It is exciting to see the human spaceflight chapter of the RL10 engine begin.\"\n\nSLS for Artemis II features ULA's Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) with a single RL10, but future versions, beginning with Artemis IV, will use the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) powered by four RL10 engines. The EUS will give the rocket extra lifting power, roughly three times the lifting capability of current commercial launch vehicles.\n\nThe RL10 was one of several Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion systems that helped make Starliner's first launch with astronauts a success.\n\nTwo Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ-60A solid rocket boosters, each standing 67 feet tall and generating more than 375,000 pounds of thrust, gave the Atlas V an extra boost during liftoff. This was the final mission for the monolithic, filament-wound booster, which was developed specifically for the Atlas V and has flown more than 100 times since 2003.\n\nThe vehicle's Centaur upper stage is equipped with smaller Aerojet Rocketdyne thrusters used for propellant settling, as well as pressurized tanks that support operation of the launch vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, L3Harris provided flight-critical avionics to the Centaur and Atlas V core stage, enabling a successful launch and continued flight to the International Space Station. Specifically designed and qualified for use on launch vehicles and spacecraft, L3Harris' highly-reliable suite of avionics includes communications, range safety receivers, power distribution and control, data acquisition, flight computers and navigation.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft is now making its way to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Suni Williams.", "source": {"uri": "l3harris.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "l3harris.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RL10", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RL10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerojet_Rocketdyne", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerojet Rocketdyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft propulsion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.l3harris.com/sites/default/files/2024-06/ar-starliner-ula-teaser.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Concurrently, mission managers on Earth are preparing for the scheduled June 5 launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which is part of NASA's Crew Flight Test.\n\nAboard the International Space Station (ISS), the Expedition 71 crew kicked off Monday with spacesuit work and cargo operations. Back on Earth, mission managers are targeting June 5 for the launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on NASA's Crew Flight Test.\n\nFour NASA astronauts spent much of Monday in the Quest airlock checking out spacesuits and reviewing procedures for a trio of spacewalks targeted to take place in June. Flight Engineer Mike Barratt started the work as he powered up the spacesuits, cleaned cooling loops, and serviced suit components throughout the day. Flight Engineer Tracy C. Dyson assisted Barratt with the suit job then trained on the suit safety systems and jet packs that would be used to maneuver back to the station in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nFlight Engineer Matthew Dominick also participated in the spacesuit and jet pack safety training. He also joined Flight Engineer Jeanette Epps and reviewed standard spacewalk procedures such as suiting up, exiting and entering Quest, safety steps, and communication protocols. NASA will announce the spacewalk details and spacewalkers in an upcoming media advisory and news briefing.\n\nOn Saturday, June 1, a Roscosmos Progress 88 cargo craft docked to the space station's Poisk module packed with about three tons food, fuel, and supplies. Cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub monitored Progress' arrival then spent a portion of the weekend and all-day Monday unloading the new cargo. Kononenko also replaced communications gear in the Zvezda service module while Chub set up and photographed a new space physics investigation.\n\nCosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin pointed a camera outside a station window toward Earth today and photographed landmarks for a pair of Earth observation studies. At the end of the day, Grebenkin installed hardware to image Earth's atmosphere in ultraviolet wavelengths. Researchers use the imagery to understand natural events and man-made impacts on Earth's surface and atmosphere.\n\nTeams at NASA and Boeing confirmed Monday the company's Starliner spacecraft, ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket, and ground support equipment are healthy and ready for the next launch attempt. The first Starliner flight with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, known as NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, is targeted to liftoff at 10:52 a.m. EDT Wednesday, June 5, to the International Space Station for about a one week stay aboard the microgravity laboratory.", "source": {"uri": "scitechdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SciTechDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space suit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_Joint_Airlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quest Joint Airlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Dominick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Dominick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanette_Epps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeanette Epps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Kononenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oleg Kononenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roscosmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Chub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikolai Chub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisk_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poisk (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvezda_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zvezda (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth observation satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://scitechdaily.com/images/Boeings-CST-100-Starliner-Crew-Ship-Approaches-the-International-Space-Station-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 217, "textEnd": 223, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1496, "textEnd": 1502}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

And it won't be her first entry in the history books.\n\nIn 2012, during a prior trip to the International Space Station, Williams became the first person to finish a triathlon in space, during which she simulated swimming using a weight-lifting machine and ran on a treadmill while strapped in by a harness so she wouldn't float away.\n\nThat came after she ran the Boston Marathon from the space station in 2007.\n\nWilliams received her commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy from the United States Naval Academy in May 1987. Williams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions, Expeditions 14/15 in 2006 and 32/33 and 2012.\n\nShe served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33.\n\nBoeing's Crew Flight Test mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\nLast-minute computer trouble nixed Saturday's launch attempt for Boeing's first astronaut flight, the latest in a string of delays over the years.\n\nIt was the second launch attempt. The first try on May 6 was delayed for leak checks and rocket repairs With the launch, Boeing became the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.

The entire stack, including the rocket and spacecraft, was rolled back from the launchpad for testing and repairs.\n\nSince then, mission teams have had to work through multiple issues with the capsule and rocket to go for today's third launch attempt within just a month's time.\n\nAfter the initial scrub on May 6, the teams worked through a helium leak on the spacecraft service module, a \"design vulnerability\" in the propulsion system and an assessment of Starliner's parachutes.\n\nSeveral issues also cropped up during the June 1 launch attempt, which was called with less than four minutes left on the countdown clock prior to liftoff.\n\nEarly in the countdown, teams reported a loss of data for valves responsible for replenishing the liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel flowing into the Atlas V rocket's upper stage.\n\nThen, when Starliner shifted from ground power to internal power, there was a slight increase in voltage that turned off the cabin fans, which keep the astronauts cool as they sit in their spacesuits in the capsule.\n\nQuick actions by the mission teams solved both issues within plenty of time to stay on track for launch.\n\nBut moments before liftoff, the ground launch sequencer -- the computer that tells the rocket to launch -- triggered an automatic hold that prevented the launch.\n\nThe United Launch Alliance team investigated the issue and replaced the computer over the weekend, and deemed Starliner ready to fly once more.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_strickland@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Ashley Strickland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "a_href_https@edition.cnn.com", "name": "A Href=\"Https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space suit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240531224252-boeing-starliner-053124-super-tease.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 171, "textEnd": 176, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 811, "textEnd": 817}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

The successful launch now gives NASA a second option, removing SpaceX's US-based monopoly on human-to-space transport.\n\nCompared to SpaceX, Boeing has been slower to break into the commercial human-space transport business. In 2014, NASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX to build spacecraft to transport its astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\nSpaceX began launching astronauts in 2020, but Boeing's effort was hit with costly delays.

She was a test pilot in the U.S. Navy and has more than 3,000 hours flying 30 different aircraft. She was selected as a NASA astronaut in 1998. She has spent 322 days in space and for a while held the record for total time on spacewalks by a woman.\n\nMr. Wilmore, a native of Tennessee, was also a Navy test pilot, and he flew combat missions over Iraq and Bosnia in the 1990s. He was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 2000. During his two previous missions, he spent a total of 167 days in space.\n\nTheir last trips to orbit were years ago.\n\nMs. Williams had two long-duration stays on the International Space Station, the second ending in November 2012. Mr. Wilmore served as the pilot of a space shuttle mission in 2009, and then spent five and a half months on the space station from September 2014 to March 2015.\n\nAfter a glitch-filled test flight in December 2019 with no crew aboard, delays shuffled the astronaut assignments. Indeed, none of the astronauts that NASA named in 2018 to fly on the test flight ended up being on it.\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Wilmore was named commander of the test flight. In 2022, Ms. Williams was shifted to the test flight, serving as the pilot. (She originally was assigned to serve as the commander of the second flight, the first operational one that would take four astronauts to the space station for six months.)", "source": {"uri":

Boeing has been plagued with delays and numerous missteps since it took up the challenge to wean US dependence on Russia to ferry NASA crews and equipment to the space station.\n\nWith less than four minutes left in the countdown, the mission was aborted after a redundant computer check flagged a potential problem. The launch of the capsule, atop Lockheed Martin Corp's Atlas V rocket, was rescheduled for yesterday.\n\nEven if Starliner took off and reached the station, it would hardly be a roaring success. Boeing's partnership with Lockheed Martin, United Launch Alliance, is about seven years behind on its first crewed mission, and the Atlas V is a cargo rocket that is at the end of its useful life.\n\nIt is hard to tell how much cash Boeing's space business is burning, because it is tucked under its money-losing defense unit, but it is a problem the company cannot afford.\n\nBoeing should carve out its space business and combine it with a bold, entrepreneurial space company, with the backing of deep-pocketed venture capital firms whose principals dream about going to space.\n\nThe unit desperately needs a shake-up to compete and can no longer rest on the laurels of its heyday when the Saturn rocket powered the Apollo missions to the moon.\n\nThe goal should be to match SpaceX's success and help drive down the cost of space launches as NASA seeks to put people on Mars with the moon as a way station.\n\nBoeing has failed so far at its mission to replace US dependence on Russia for ferrying people and supplies to the space station. Russia last year agreed to stay on as a space station partner through 2028.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions heat up, Russia now plans to build its own orbital station. Do not be surprised if China joins in that effort. If it were not for SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, which has flown nine crewed missions since 2020, Russia could strand US astronauts in space.\n\nThis is not good for the US, nor for Boeing, which has serious quality and safety problems at aircraft factories that the US Federal Aviation Administration has criticized for having a dysfunctional corporate culture.\n\nBoeing has its plate full trying to turn around its main business, and it could still take years to fix, said Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, the biggest buyer of Boeing's wide-body commercial aircraft.\n\n\"For me, this will be a five-year hiatus starting from now,\" Clark said at the weekend. \"I don't think they will recapture their production line on all aircraft types.\"\n\nBoeing needs an all-hands-on-deck overhaul of its manufacturing process for commercial aircraft. If it cannot turn around its airliner business, the company is sunk. That is the top priority, and nothing else comes close. The company's string of missteps has shown management lacks the ability to juggle that mess and turn around its space business.\n\nThat is not the case with Boeing's other units. Global Services was started in 2017 as an extension of commercial aircraft activities and is the most profitable business right now. Defense, space and security are lumped into one unit.\n\nDefense is a keeper because of the synergies it has with commercial aircraft, including shared platforms for the P-8 patrol aircraft and the KC-46 Pegasus mid-air refueling tanker. The security business, which includes cybersecurity, has more in common with defense than space, and the need to protect networks is only growing.\n\nThe space unit is a full-service company that maintains the space station, builds and services satellites, and serves as a main contractor for NASA's Space Launch System, which is designed to put US astronauts back on the moon and on Mars.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed partnership, launched the new Vulcan rocket in January after years of delays. Vulcan is designed to compete with SpaceX's heavy-lift Falcon family of rockets.\n\nThere is value and potential appetite for a pure-play company in this second space race, but Boeing's space business needs focus and bold leadership, which it cannot expect to get from current management. Besides keeping the commercial aircraft business from going under, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is busy finding a successor after he agreed to step down at the end of this year.\n\nThe defense, space and security unit posted a US$1.8 billion operating loss last year. There has been speculation that Boeing wants to exit its space partnership with Lockheed. Bloomberg News reported that the company is also looking to sell a couple of small defense businesses. This does not go far enough.\n\nFor the US, the space industry needs to remain several steps ahead of Russia and China, which landed its first spacecraft on the dark side of the moon on Saturday -- the same day Boeing aborted its Starliner mission.\n\nBoeing should turn its space business loose and allow a firm backed by deep-pocketed investors to revamp its culture and attract fresh talent. Instead of working on moonshots and going to Mars, Boeing needs to stick closer to home and concentrate on its main priority -- building the highest quality commercial aircraft on time and under budget.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturn (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerial refueling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_(airline)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates (airline)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_Centaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulcan Centaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-lift_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy-lift launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

A significant innovation was the introduction of onboard computers, primitive by today's standards but capable of assisting with the complexities of a space rendezvous.\n\nDuring the final Gemini mission, Buzz Aldrin -- nicknamed \"Dr Rendezvous\" -- was forced to pull out a sextant and make critical calculations on paper using a slide rule, in order to accomplish docking with an uncrewed practice spacecraft after the computerized tracking system went down.\n\n- Apollo -\n\nApollo was NASA's response to President John F. Kennedy's challenge to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s.\n\nAchieving the goal required three key pieces of technology.\n\nThe first was the giant Saturn V rocket. Designed under ex-Nazi Wernher von Braun, it remained the most powerful rocket for five decades.\n\nThe second piece was the command module -- whose interior was as roomy as a big car -- and the third was the lunar descent vehicle.\n\nWhile Apollo 11 achieved humanity's first crewed touchdown on July 20, 1969, the program was also marked by tragedy. A fire during a preflight test for Apollo 1 killed all three crew members, highlighting the risks and sacrifices made in pursuit of space exploration.\n\n- Space Shuttle -\n\nNASA's Space Shuttle program, which spanned from 1981 to 2011, took a revolutionary approach by combining rocket launch, capsule re-entry, and glider-like runway landings.\n\nThe era marked significant milestones, including the first space flights by American women and minorities, the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope on the shuttle Discovery, and the construction of the International Space Station in the late 1990s.\n\nHowever, it was also marred by two devastating tragedies: the 1986 Challenger disaster, which occurred just after launch, and the 2003 Columbia disaster, which happened during re-entry.\n\nBoth incidents resulted in the loss of all crew members, totaling 14 lives.\n\n- Crew Dragon and Starliner -\n\nAfter the space shuttle was retired, the United States was left without a homegrown capacity to launch its astronauts and was forced to rely on Russian Soyuz rockets.\n\nNASA decided to shift from a model where it owned the hardware, to instead hiring services from the commercial industry in multibillion dollar contracts.\n\nNewcomer SpaceX beat heavily-favored aerospace titan Boeing in flying its first crew to the ISS in 2020, an underdog triumph that catapulted Elon Musk's company to powerhouse status.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing has struggled with technical issues, echoing wider organizational problems that have plagued its aviation division.\n\nBoth companies have adopted the classic gumdrop-shaped capsule design, but with modern twists: sleek displays, autonomous flight, and full reusability.\n\nNASA's Orion capsule should be the seventh spaceship to carry American astronauts during the Artemis II mission around the Moon, set for 2025.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Boeing built the spacecraft. It's called the Starliner.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Three, two, one, ignition and lift-off of Starliner and Atlas V, carrying two American heroes.\n\nMARTIN: On board are NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. They are headed to the International Space Station. Today's launch came after years of delays. Joining us to talk about this milestone is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Geoff, welcome.\n\nGEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi, Michel.\n\nMARTIN: So tell me about these delays. Why did it take so long for today's launch to happen?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. I mean, Starliner's had problems right from the start. Way back in 2019, before the pandemic, it had its first uncrewed test flight. And an improperly set clock aboard the spacecraft caused its engines to fire too early, so it couldn't reach the proper orbit. It never made it to the space station, where it was supposed to go, and it had to come home early.\n\nIt's second test flight also had problems. They found issues with the parachutes, which are obviously pretty important for landing. They also found that engineers had used potentially flammable tape onboard the spacecraft to wrap up all the wires. They had to replace all that tape. There are a lot of wires on a spaceship, so that took a long time.\n\nNow they've been trying for weeks, and they've called off the launch twice before this, first for stuck valve, then for a computer glitch. Finally, finally, today, it all came together. It took off with everything except the astronauts' suitcases.\n\nMARTIN: OK, wait a minute. What about the suitcases?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. This is like the final summer travel sort of injustice. Basically, the space station's urine recycling system broke last week. They had to put in a spare pump. But, you know, you'd rather have a toilet, I suppose, than space in your suitcases.\n\nMARTIN: OK, but I am going to worry about how they're going to change their clothes, but I'll just keep that thought. So this is Starliner's first flight with people inside. Can you just tell us a little bit more about the spacecraft?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. It's a gumdrop-shaped capsule about the size of a midsized SUV on the inside. It's a throwback to what you might have seen in the Apollo era, but obviously updated. This is one of two capsules NASA's developed with private companies to go to the space station. The other one is SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Dragon actually had its first test flight in 2020 and now regularly flies to the station, and it also costs less than Starliner to develop.\n\nMARTIN: Geoff, I do think it's fair to ask, though, given all the problems that Boeing has had with its airplanes lately, is NASA sure this is safe?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Yeah. I mean, Boeing is an enormous company. The space division is completely separate from the aviation division, and spacecraft are obviously held to a different standard. Hundreds of Boeing and NASA engineers have been looking over this thing for years to make sure it works, and it appeared to today. That being said, at least one analyst I spoke to said there is a connection. You know Boeing's quality control for Starliner is clearly not as good as it should be, similar to what's happened in the aviation division, but it's caused delays, not necessarily, you know, doors to fall off the spaceship or anything like that.\n\nMARTIN: So what happens now?\n\nBRUMFIEL: Well, the astronauts are going to spend about a day flying to the station. Most of that'll be on autopilot, but they'll also switch it off autopilot and try driving it around a little bit, you know, piloting it manually just to make sure it works. Once they've docked to station, they'll stay there for about a week, running various tests on the Starliner. And then they're going to come back and land somewhere in the Western United States using those parachutes, which, hopefully, all the kinks are worked out, and they come down, no problem.\n\nMARTIN: OK. That is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Geoff, thank you.\n\nBRUMFIEL: Thank you.

The International Space Station (ISS) residents also kept their research and lab maintenance duties while unpacking a new cargo ship.\n\nNASA Flight Engineers Matthew Dominick and Mike Barratt started their morning inside the Quest airlock preparing suits and equipment for upcoming spacewalks. The duo then joined fellow NASA astronauts Tracy C. Dyson and Jeanette Epps after lunchtime for a spacewalk conference with specialists on the ground. Afterward, Dyson and Dominick partnered together organizing and configuring a variety of spacewalk tools in Quest. NASA will announce the spacewalk details and spacewalkers in an upcoming media advisory and news briefing.\n\nEarlier, Epps powered on a pair of Astrobee robotic free flyers for an operations test. She also set up a pair of Kubik research incubators inside the Columbus laboratory module. At the end of the day, Epps gathered in the Harmony module with Barratt and Dominick for eye checks using a medical imaging device viewing the cornea, retina, and optic nerve.\n\nStation commander and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko who is on his fifth mission aboard the orbital outpost has accumulated 1,000 days in microgravity as of June 4.

Fellow cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin wrapped up an experiment session and stowed hardware that images Earth's upper atmosphere in ultraviolet wavelengths. Afterward, he studied ways international crews and mission controllers can improve communications to inform crew training and ensure mission success.\n\nTeams at NASA and Boeing confirmed Monday the company's Starliner spacecraft, ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket, and ground support equipment are healthy and ready for the next launch attempt. The first Starliner flight with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, known as NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, is targeted to liftoff at 10:52 a.m. EDT Wednesday, June 5, to the International Space Station for about a one week stay aboard the microgravity laboratory.", "source": {"uri": "scitechdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SciTechDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freeman Dyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Dominick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Dominick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_Joint_Airlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quest Joint Airlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanette_Epps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeanette Epps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Kononenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oleg Kononenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roscosmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modular design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Chub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikolai Chub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_44", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expedition 44"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Padalka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gennady Padalka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://scitechdaily.com/images/Aurora-Swirls-Above-Indian-Ocean-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622079", "eventUri": "eng-9622079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 256, "textEnd": 262, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-11", "textStart": 1623, "textEnd": 1641}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 2604, "textEnd": 2610}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

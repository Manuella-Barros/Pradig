During a panel segment on Sunday's Media Buzz program, Kurtz told Reason Senior Editor Robby Soave that Trump had falsely accused Joe Biden's Justice Department of attempting to kill him because a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago authorized deadly force, which is standard language. \"I mean, we've got to tell the truth,\" Soave admitted. \"It is common practice. Also, they knew that Trump was not there at Mar-a-Lago.\" \"And deliberately timed the raid,\" Kurtz added. So they were clearly not. You wouldn't go that day.\" ALSO READ: NFL drafts Capitol Hill staffers for lobbying retreat \"So they were clearly not doing that,\" Soave agreed. \"This is standard operating procedure.\" Kurtz pointed out to guest Lucy Caldwell that a search warrant for Biden's home also used the same language. \"But a former sitting president pursuing and promoting the idea that we should act as though the current president sent and sicced FBI agents on him to shoot and kill him,\" Caldwell replied. \"That is very, very dangerous.\" \"Right,\" Kurtz said. \"But, you know, it only takes a couple of crazy people.

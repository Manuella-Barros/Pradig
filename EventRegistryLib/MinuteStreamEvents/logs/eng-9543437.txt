Responding troopers found a heavily damaged 2016 Honda Civic in the woods amid several trees.\n\nA man's body was found outside the car, and a bear was observed in the woods in the vicinity of the scene. Evidence shows the bear had at some point made contact with the body.\n\nPreliminary investigation showed that at some point several hours prior to 11 a.m., the Honda was driving south on Route 91 when for reasons still under investigation, the driver lost control of the car, struck the guardrail multiple times and went off the roadway to the right. The car then traveled down an embankment, entered the woods and struck several trees.\n\nState police said evidence and observations at the scene suggest that the driver likely died as a result of the crash and was either fully or partially ejected from the car and later dragged from the vehicle by the bear.

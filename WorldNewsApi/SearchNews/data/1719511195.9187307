There are several areas in Bhupalpally district that are affected by Maoists. Just prior to the Lok Sabha elections, the banned outfit released warning letters while urging to boycott the elections. But Khare took several preventive and precautionary steps apart from conducting awareness programmes among the people and ensured peaceful polling. To mark its celebrations, and as sought by police officials, the SP conducted the success meet with DSPs, CIs, SIs and all others. The police officials on Sunday morning released videos of a dance performance by the SP in Whatsapp group.

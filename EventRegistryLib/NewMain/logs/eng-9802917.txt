(AP) -- Donald Trump recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out, holding a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating.\n\nAs the Republican presidential nominee addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled election. Trump said he had proposed three debates with three television networks in September.\n\nTrump again wrongly insisted there had been a \"peaceful transfer\" of power in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump has harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud.\n\nIn taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nTrump's decision to go on ABC sets up a high-stakes moment in an election where Biden's catastrophic performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.\n\nFACT FOCUS: A look at claims made by Trump at news conference\n\nIn his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, former President Donald Trump said he would debate her on Sept. 10 and pushed for two more debates. The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before.\n\nHere's a look at some of those claims. ___\n\nCLAIM: \"The biggest crowd I've ever spoken -- I've spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump was comparing the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd that attended Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nBut far more people are estimated to have been at the latter than the former.\n\nHarris and Walz show their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nWAYNE, Mich. (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, played up their support for organized labor at a Detroit-area union hall on Thursday, with the Democratic nominee saying \"we're all in this together\" as the new ticket lavishes attention on a crucial base of support.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz, who joined the ticket on Tuesday, spoke Thursday to about 100 United Auto Workers members at Local 900 Hall, which represents Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant. The stop occurred shortly after Republican nominee Donald Trump held a press conference in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nAs she proclaimed that it was \"good to be in the house of labor,\" Harris described the value of unions, saying they were \"about understanding that no one should be made to fight alone\" and that \"hard work is good work.\"\n\n\"We have fun doing hard work, because we know what we stand for,\" she said. \"When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We know what we stand for, and we stand for the people and we stand for the dignity of work, and we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality.\n\nShe continued: \"And so we will fight for all of it.\"\n\nA deadly tornado, flooding rains and swollen rivers plague residents in the path of Debby\n\nLUCAMA, N.C. (AP) -- Tornadoes spawned by Debby leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person early Thursday, as the tropical system dropped heavy rain and flooded communities across North and South Carolina.\n\nIt only took 15 seconds for a tornado to devastate Genesis Cooper's home in Lucama, North Carolina, a small town about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Raleigh. He almost slept through it -- if not for an alert on his wife's phone.\n\nHe, his wife and their 20-year-old son huddled in a bathroom with blankets. They felt vibrations and heard glass shattering before hearing a sudden boom.\n\n\"I can't even describe it. It's like, suction, that's what it felt like,\" Cooper said. \"Like something is squeezing, like your ears are popping.\"\n\nThe tornado was one of at least three reported overnight in North Carolina, and perhaps the most devastating. One person was found dead in a home damaged by the Lucama tornado, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\"\n\nThree sold-out concerts were canceled Wednesday because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning.\n\nEurope is enamored with the American superstar: The German town of Gelsenkirchen renamed itself \"Swiftkirchen\" before its mid-July concerts.\n\nConcert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria's interior minister, Gerhard Karner.\n\nAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer defended the decision to cancel the concerts, saying the arrests of the suspects took place too close to the shows, scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar jointly demanded Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza next week, saying Thursday that \"only the details\" of carrying out a cease-fire and hostage release remain to be negotiated. \"There is no further time to waste, nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday, \"Pursuant to the proposal by the U.S. and the mediators, Israel will -- on 15 August -- send the negotiations team to a place to be determined in order to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim al-Thani, mediators in indirect negotiations to end 10 months of devastating war in Gaza, set the talks for Aug. 15, to take place in either Doha, Qatar, or Cairo.\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the push by mediators, said only four or five areas of disagreement over implementation remained to be resolved between the two opponents.\n\nThe official cited the timing of a planned swap of Palestinian detainees held by Israel, and hostages held by Hamas, as an example.\n\nMaui remembers the 102 lost in the Lahaina wildfire with a paddle out 1 year after devastating blaze\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of Maui surfers, canoe paddlers and boat riders made their way into the ocean off Lahaina on Thursday to remember the 102 people killed when the nation's deadliest wildfire in more than a century destroyed the historic town one year ago.\n\nThe \"paddle out\" gathering is a ritual observed in Hawaii in honor of loved ones. So many spectators packed a beach park to watch the surfers that there was little room to move. People blew conch shells both from shore and the water as others dropped flower petals in the ocean.\n\n\"Today we're remembering the 102 loved ones we lost, the many injured, those who lost their homes,\" Gov. Josh Green said at a news conference. \"We are grieving for them, still.\"\n\nHere's what else you need to know about the first anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023 wildfire:\n\nThe wildfire destroyed more than 2,200 homes and left 12,000 people without housing. Thousands spent the past year in hotels and have slowly been moving into rental apartments, houses and temporary modular homes while permanent housing is built.\n\nCould 2 NASA astronauts be stuck at the space station until next year? Here's what to know\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA is wrestling over how and when to bring two astronauts back from the International Space Station, after repeatedly delaying their return aboard Boeing's troubled capsule.\n\nDo they take a chance and send them home soon in Boeing's Starliner? Or wait and bring them back next year with SpaceX?\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been up there since early June, their planned eight-day mission at the two-month mark and possibly surpassing eight months.\n\nTesting continues, with Boeing expressing confidence in its spacecraft but NASA divided. A decision is expected next week.\n\nThis is Boeing's first time launching astronauts, after flying a pair of empty Starliners that suffered software and other issues. Even before Wilmore and Williams blasted off June 5, their capsule sprang a leak in propulsion-related plumbing. Boeing and NASA judged the small helium leak to be stable and isolated, and proceeded with the test flight. But as Starliner approached the space station the next day, four more leaks erupted. Five thrusters also failed.\n\nWall Street rallies to its best day since 2022 on encouraging unemployment data; S&P 500 jumps 2.3%\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rallied Thursday in Wall Street's latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about the slowing economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 2.3% for its best day since 2022 and shaved off all but 0.5% of its loss from what was a brutal start to the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks helped lead the way.\n\nTreasury yields also climbed in the bond market in a signal investors are feeling less worried about the economy after a report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number was better than economists expected.\n\nIt was exactly a week ago that worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims helped enflame worries that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at too high of an economy-slowing level for too long in order to beat inflation. That helped send markets reeling, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that sent shockwaves worldwide by scrambling a favorite trade among some hedge funds.\n\nAt the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down nearly 10% from its all-time high set last month. Such drops are regular occurrences on Wall Street, and \"corrections\" of 10% happen roughly every year or two. After Thursday's jump, the index is back within about 6% of its record.\n\nUS men's basketball team rallies to beat Serbia at Paris Olympics, will face France for gold medal\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Down by 11 in the fourth quarter, against what looked like overwhelming odds, the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team got a spark.\n\nSix points in two seconds.\n\nKevin Durant and Devin Booker provided that wild sequence to start the comeback, Stephen Curry had a scoring night like almost none other in U.S. Olympic history, and the Americans will play for gold at the Paris Games. Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. beat Serbia 95-91 in a semifinal classic on Thursday night.\n\nLeBron James had the fourth triple-double in Olympic history for the U.S., which trailed by 17 points in the first half and faced an 11-point halftime deficit -- the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of Team USA basketball,\" Curry said. \"And that was a special one.\"", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho

PRICE AND ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON\n\nAssociated Press\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. -- Donald Trump recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out, holding a lengthy press conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign is generating.\n\nAs the Republican presidential nominee addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, agreed to a Sept. 10 debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled election. Trump said he proposed three debates with three television networks in September.\n\nTrump again insisted there was a \"peaceful transfer\" of power in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud.\n\nIn taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a press conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, played up their support for organized labor at a Detroit-area union hall on Thursday, with the Democratic nominee saying \"we're all in this together\" as the new ticket lavishes attention on a crucial base of support.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have increasingly criticized Harris for not engaging extensively with journalists and taking questions during the early days of her candidacy. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Michigan, Harris said she talked with her aides and wants to schedule an interview before the end of the month.\n\nShe also confirmed that she would participate in a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News -- which Trump backed out of before recommitting to it Thursday -- and said she would be \"happy\" to discuss subsequent debates after that one occurs.\n\nHarris and Walz spoke to about 100 United Auto Workers members at Local 900 Hall, which represents Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant. The stop occurred shortly after Trump's press conference in Florida.\n\nAs she proclaimed that it was \"good to be in the house of labor,\" Harris described the value of unions, saying they were \"about understanding that no one should be made to fight alone\" and that \"hard work is good work.\"\n\n\"We have fun doing hard work, because we know what we stand for,\" she said. \"When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We know what we stand for, and we stand for the people and we stand for the dignity of work, and we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality.\n\nShe continued: \"And so we will fight for all of it.\"\n\nThe members at Local 900 were the first Ford workers to strike in 2023 when the union's contract with the company expired. Workers at the assembly plant went on strike Sept. 15 and remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced a tentative agreement with Ford.\n\nAfter Biden ended his reelection campaign last month and endorsed his vice president, organized labor quickly rallied around Harris. The AFL-CIO endorsed her after having first backed Biden. The UAW formally backed her last week.\n\nAnother key moment is set\n\nTrump's decision to go on ABC, days after posting on his social media platform that he would not appear on the network, sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where Biden's performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.\n\n\"I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight,\" he said.\n\nThursday's event was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Walz as her running mate. Trump called Walz a \"radical left man.\"\n\nHe repeatedly suggested Harris was not intelligent enough to debate him. Harris, for her part, has tried to goad Trump into debating and told an audience in Atlanta recently that if he had anything to say about her, he should \"say it to my face.\"\n\nTrump grew visibly perturbed when pressed on Harris' crowds and newfound Democratic enthusiasm, dismissing a question about his lighter campaign schedule as stupid.\n\nTrump says he has not \"recalibrated\" his campaign, despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists quietly complained about.\n\nWhen asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said: \"She's a woman. She represents certain groups of people.\"\n\nQuestions about abortion\n\nTrump suggested abortion will not be a major issue in the campaign and the outcome in November.\n\nHe said the matter \"has become much less of an issue\" since the Supreme Court ended the federal constitutional right to abortion services and returned control of the matter to state governments. But abortion is widely seen as a general election liability, and Trump named states such as Ohio and Kansas that have since voted to protect abortion rights.\n\nTrump also said he expected Florida \"will go in a little more liberal way than people thought\" when it votes to repeal an abortion ban this year, but he did not respond to questions asking how he would vote.\n\nTrump argued that Democrats, Republicans and \"everybody\" are pleased with the results of the 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nFalse claims on Jan. 6\n\nDonald Trump falsely claimed during the press conference that \"nobody was killed on Jan. 6,\" the date in 2021 when pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol amid Congress' effort to certify Biden's 2020 election victory after Trump refused to concede.\n\nPolice shot and killed Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran from San Diego, as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot that breached the building.\n\nTrump has often cited Babbitt's death while lamenting the treatment of those who first attended a rally outside the White House that day, then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police and entered the building.\n\n\"I think those people were treated very badly. When you compare it to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed,\" Trump said Thursday, adding \"nobody was killed on Jan. 6.\"", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_l_price@omaha.com", "name": "Michelle L.

The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before.\n\nHere's a look at some of those claims. ___\n\nCLAIM: \"The biggest crowd I've ever spoken -- I've spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump was comparing the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd that attended Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nBut far more people are estimated to have been at the former than the latter.\n\nHarris and Walz show their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nWAYNE, Mich. (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, played up their support for organized labor at a Detroit-area union hall on Thursday, with the Democratic nominee saying \"we're all in this together\" as the new ticket lavishes attention on a crucial base of support.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz, who joined the ticket on Tuesday, spoke Thursday to about 100 United Auto Workers members at Local 900 Hall, which represents Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant. The stop occurred shortly after Republican nominee Donald Trump held a press conference in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nAs she proclaimed that it was \"good to be in the house of labor,\" Harris described the value of unions, saying they were \"about understanding that no one should be made to fight alone\" and that \"hard work is good work.\"\n\n\"We have fun doing hard work, because we know what we stand for,\" she said. \"When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.

We stand for equality.\n\nShe continued: \"And so we will fight for all of it.\"\n\nA deadly tornado, flooding rains and swollen rivers plague residents in the path of Debby\n\nLUCAMA, N.C. (AP) -- Tornadoes spawned by Debby leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person early Thursday, as the tropical system dropped heavy rain and flooded communities across North and South Carolina.\n\nIt only took 15 seconds for a tornado to devastate Genesis Cooper's home in Lucama, North Carolina, a small town about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Raleigh. He almost slept through it -- if not for an alert on his wife's phone.\n\nHe, his wife and their 20-year-old son huddled in a bathroom with blankets. They felt vibrations and heard glass shattering before hearing a sudden boom.\n\n\"I can't even describe it. It's like, suction, that's what it felt like,\" Cooper said. \"Like something is squeezing, like your ears are popping.\"\n\nThe tornado was one of at least three reported overnight in North Carolina, and perhaps the most devastating. One person was found dead in a home damaged by the Lucama tornado, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\"\n\nThree sold-out concerts were canceled Wednesday because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning.\n\nEurope is enamored with the American superstar: The German town of Gelsenkirchen renamed itself \"Swiftkirchen\" before its mid-July concerts.\n\nConcert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria's interior minister, Gerhard Karner.\n\nAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer defended the decision to cancel the concerts, saying the arrests of the suspects took place too close to the shows, scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nUS men's basketball team rallies to beat Serbia at Paris Olympics, will face France for gold medal\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Down by 11 in the fourth quarter, against what looked like overwhelming odds, the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team got a spark.\n\nSix points in two seconds.\n\nKevin Durant and Devin Booker provided that wild sequence to start the comeback, Stephen Curry had a scoring night like almost none other in U.S. Olympic history, and the Americans will play for gold at the Paris Games. Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. beat Serbia 95-91 in a semifinal classic on Thursday night.\n\nLeBron James had the fourth triple-double in Olympic history for the U.S., which trailed by 17 points in the first half and faced an 11-point halftime deficit -- the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of Team USA basketball,\" Curry said. \"And that was a special one.\"\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar jointly demanded Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza next week, saying Thursday that \"only the details\" of carrying out a cease-fire and hostage release remain to be negotiated. \"There is no further time to waste, nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had accepted the invitation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim al-Thani, mediators in indirect negotiations to end 10 months of devastating war in Gaza, set the talks for Aug. 15, to take place in either Doha, Qatar, or Cairo.\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the push by mediators, said only four or five areas of disagreement over implementation remained to be resolved between the two opponents.\n\nThe official cited the timing of a planned swap of Palestinian detainees held by Israel, and hostages held by Hamas, as an example.\n\nCould 2 NASA astronauts be stuck at the space station until next year? Here's what to know\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA is wrestling over how and when to bring two astronauts back from the International Space Station, after repeatedly delaying their return aboard Boeing's troubled capsule.\n\nDo they take a chance and send them home soon in Boeing's Starliner? Or wait and bring them back next year with SpaceX?\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been up there since early June, their planned eight-day mission at the two-month mark and possibly surpassing eight months.\n\nTesting continues, with Boeing expressing confidence in its spacecraft but NASA divided. A decision is expected next week.\n\nThis is Boeing's first time launching astronauts, after flying a pair of empty Starliners that suffered software and other issues. Even before Wilmore and Williams blasted off June 5, their capsule sprang a leak in propulsion-related plumbing. Boeing and NASA judged the small helium leak to be stable and isolated, and proceeded with the test flight. But as Starliner approached the space station the next day, four more leaks erupted. Five thrusters also failed.\n\nWall Street rallies to its best day since 2022 on encouraging unemployment data; S&P 500 jumps 2.3%\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rallied Thursday in Wall Street's latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about the slowing economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 2.3% for its best day since 2022 and shaved off all but 0.5% of its loss from what was a brutal start to the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks helped lead the way.\n\nTreasury yields also climbed in the bond market in a signal investors are feeling less worried about the economy after a report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number was better than economists expected.\n\nIt was exactly a week ago that worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims helped enflame worries that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at too high of an economy-slowing level for too long in order to beat inflation. That helped send markets reeling, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that sent shockwaves worldwide by scrambling a favorite trade among some hedge funds.\n\nAt the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down nearly 10% from its all-time high set last month. Such drops are regular occurrences on Wall Street, and \"corrections\" of 10% happen roughly every year or two. After Thursday's jump, the index is back within about 6% of its record.\n\nThird person dies in listeria outbreak tied to Boar's Head deli meats\n\nThree people have now died in a listeria food poisoning outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meats, federal food safety officials announced Thursday, and the overall number of people sickened rose to 43.\n\nThe additional death happened in Virginia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a news release Thursday. The other two deaths were in New Jersey and Illinois. The CDC also said nine more cases were reported since a July 31 release about the outbreak, which started in late May.\n\nBoar's Head recalled 7 million pounds of deli meats on July 30, expanding an initial recall on July 25 after a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. The CDC said Thursday that a New York health officials tested a liverwurst sample and confirmed the same strain of listeria.\n\nThe recall includes more than 70 products -- including liverwurst, ham, beef salami and bologna -- made at the company's plant in Jarratt, Virginia.\n\nBoar's Head already faces two lawsuits over the outbreak, one in a Missouri court and the other a class action suit in federal court in New York.\n\nThe Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "timescolonist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Colonist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

REUTERS/Umit Bektas/Elizabeth Frantz\n\nUS Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic opponent Kamala Harris will debate on Sept 10 on ABC, setting up the first face-to-face match-up between the rivals in what polls show is a close race.\n\nIn a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, residence, Trump said he wanted additional debates on Sept 4 and Sept 25 that would air on Fox and NBC.\n\nHarris said in a post on X that she was looking forward to the Sept 10 debate after Trump \"finally committed.\"\n\nShe told reporters after a Detroit-area campaign stop that she was open to discussing more debates, but a campaign official reiterated their position that a Sept 4 Fox debate is off the table.\n\nDiscussions on future debates depend on Trump's participation in the Sept 10 debate on ABC, the official said. The Harris campaign had already opposed a Fox debate, saying the host network should be one that sponsored recent primary debates by both parties.\n\nTrump previously suggested he might back out of the ABC debate, scheduled before Harris, the US vice president, replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate less than three weeks ago, upending the contest. The Sept 10 debate on ABC was to be the second of two agreed upon between Biden and Trump, following their Jun 27 debate on CNN.\n\nAn Ipsos poll published on Thursday found Harris has widened her lead over Trump since late July. She leads Trump 42 percent to 37 percent, compared with a July 22-23 Reuters/Ipsos survey that showed her up 37 percent to 34 percent over Trump.\n\nThursday's Palm Beach news conference was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nHarris and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a fresh sign of how her late entry into the race has galvanised Democrats. Thursday's stop by the Democratic pair at a union hall came as the campaign said it sees labour groups as a key to tipping the balance in the election.\n\nHarris' rapid rise has sent Trump's team scrambling to recalibrate its strategy and messaging. Opinion polls show Harris has erased the lead Trump had built over Biden, and Democrats have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors since she became the party's candidate.\n\nTrump insisted on Thursday he has not altered his approach to the race. In a question-and-answer session with reporters that stretched beyond an hour, Trump hopped from topic to topic and said Harris and Walz are weak candidates.\n\nNevertheless, Trump lamented that he isn't able to face Biden in the Nov 5 election, suggesting the president was a victim of a plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden dropped his faltering reelection bid under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory after a poor debate performance against Trump.\n\nAsked about his controversial comments last week that Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, recently \"happened to turn Black,\" Trump said: \"You'll have to ask her that question, because she's the one that said it, I didn't say it. ... To me it doesn't matter. But to her, from her standpoint, I think it's very disrespectful to both, really, whether it's Indian or Black, I think it's very disrespectful to both.\"\n\nTrump's initial comments, delivered to an audience of Black journalists, drew widespread condemnation and left donors and aides baffled and alarmed. The Trump campaign didn't immediately comment further to provide evidence of remarks by Harris that Trump said he was referring to.\n\nTrump on Thursday also mocked the size of Harris' campaign crowds, even though they have matched his of late. He falsely claimed the size of the crowd he addressed on Jan 6, 2021 - the day his supporters stormed the US Capitol - was as large as those who packed the National Mall in Washington for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech in 1963.\n\n\"We actually had more people,\" Trump said. \"But I'm ok with it, because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.\"\n\nKing delivered his speech to an estimated 250,000 people in August 1963, according to the National Constitution Center. Trump's rally on Jan 6, 2021, drew about 53,000 supporters, according to the House of Representatives Select Committee's \"187 minutes of dereliction\" report.\n\nEchoing a recent attack line from his campaign, Trump criticised Harris for not doing a press interview since launching her campaign.\n\n\"She can't do an interview. She's barely competent,\" Trump said, later again calling her \"nasty,\" a go-to line that he often uses to disparage female critics.\n\nTrump has conducted a steady stream of media interviews, though they are usually with friendly, right-leaning outlets and reporters. On Wednesday, he called into the \"Fox & Friends\" morning program and took questions from the program's hosts.\n\nTrump announced the Palm Beach news conference on Thursday morning on his social media platform. Only a select group of reporters were given the advance notice needed to travel to his Florida resort in time. Reuters was not extended an invitation.\n\nHarris answered a handful of questions from reporters after meeting with auto workers in Wayne, Michigan, on Thursday, following the United Auto Workers union's endorsement of her candidacy. She said she wants to schedule a sit-down interview \"before the end of the month.\"", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nFACT FOCUS: A look at claims made by Trump at news conference\n\nIn his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, former President Donald Trump said he would debate her on Sept. 10 and pushed for two more debates. The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before.\n\nHarris and Walz show their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nWAYNE, Mich. (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are showing their support for organized labor by appearing at a Detroit-area union hall. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz spoke Thursday to several dozen United Auto Workers members. Harris and Walz are making joint campaign appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will decide the November election against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. Michigan is one of those states and organized labor is a crucial base of support for Democrats.\n\nDebby bringing heavy rain, flooding and possible tornadoes northeast into the weekend\n\nLUCAMA, N.C. (AP) -- Debby's final chapter involves moving north and northeast from the Carolinas at a faster clip with soaking rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes into the weekend. Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.\n\nMaui remembers the 102 lost in the Lahaina wildfire with a paddle out 1 year after devastating blaze\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of Maui surfers, canoe paddlers and boat riders made their way into the ocean off Lahaina, Hawaii, on Thursday to remember the 102 people killed when the nation's deadliest wildfire in more than a century destroyed the historic town one year ago. The \"paddle out\" gathering is a ritual observed in Hawaii in honor of loved ones. Boat riders dropped flower petals in the sea while surfers splashed water in the air. Spectators watched from a beach park on shore. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green says Maui is still grieving for those lost in the Aug. 8, 2023, fire.\n\nCould 2 NASA astronauts be stuck at the space station until next year? Here's what to know\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA is wrestling over how and when to bring two astronauts back from the International Space Station after running into trouble with their new Boeing capsule. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been up there since early June, two months longer than planned. Their stay could now stretch into next year, if NASA decides the thrusters on Boeing's Starliner cannot be trusted to safely bring them home. Plan B is SpaceX. If necessary, NASA says it will remove two of the four astronauts due to launch to the space station next month The empty seats would be for Wilmore and Williams, but they wouldn't come back until February.\n\nWall Street rallies to its best day since 2022 on encouraging unemployment data; S&P 500 jumps 2.3%\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rallied to their best day since 2022 in Wall Street's latest sharp swerve. The S&P 500 jumped 2.3% Thursday after a better-than-expected report on unemployment calmed worries about the slowing economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.9%. Treasury yields also climbed in the bond market, a signal that investors are feeling less worried about the economy, after a report showed fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Eli Lilly helped lead the market after delivering better profit for the spring than expected, while Big Tech stocks rebounded.\n\nUS men's basketball team rallies to beat Serbia at Paris Olympics, will face France for gold medal\n\nPARIS (AP) -- With six points in two seconds, the U.S. Olympic team was on its way. To a comeback. To a win. And to another Olympic gold medal game. Stephen Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. will play for gold in the Paris Olympics on Saturday night after beating Serbia 95-91. The U.S. trailed by 17 points in the first half, plus faced an 11-point halftime deficit -- the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992. Curry says \"that was a special one.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nNPA Announces New Cohort of IMPACT Fellows: Six remarkable postdocs hailing from underrepresented communities form fourth IMPACT

I want us to schedule an interview by the end of the month.\"\n\nShe did not give a specific date or which news outlet she would speak to.\n\nKamala Harris said she would appear for a media interview in late August\n\nHarris will spend Friday in Arizona campaigning as part of her Arizona state tour with her running mate Tim Walz.\n\nShe spoke to reporters traveling with her and answered questions shortly after her Republican rival Donald Trump held an hour-long press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump claimed that Harris \"isn't smart enough to do a press conference.\"\n\n\"And I think that's a shame, but we need smart people to lead this country.\"\n\nHarris did not address a number of issues when asked by reporters, including criticism of Walz over his military record.\n\nBut the Democratic candidate confirmed she will face Trump on September 10, a debate hosted by ABC News.\n\nBut she did not accept Trump's proposal for two more debates: on Sept. 4 with Fox News or on Sept. 25 with NBC.\n\nIn fact, she seemed to indicate that the September 4 debate was off the table. She wanted to see if Trump would show up at the September 10 event before making a decision.\n\n\"I am certainly pleased that we can have that conversation about an additional debate after September 10,\" she said.\n\nTrump skipped all Republican primary debates and withdrew from one debate with Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The former president had also withdrawn from the ABC debate, which he had originally agreed to attend when Biden was still the nominee, before again agreeing to attend.\n\nHarris declined to comment on Trump's rambling, noncommittal press conference on Thursday, saying she missed it because she was too busy talking to voters. Harris was campaigning in Michigan at the time.\n\n\"I don't want to speculate anymore about what he thinks,\" she said when asked about some of the criticisms of Trump.\n\nTrump was visibly angry at points in his press conference, repeatedly lashing out at his Democratic rival, calling her the \"politically correct\" choice for a nominee, questioning her intellect and questioning whether she should be on the ticket at all.\n\nHe called her the \"first loser\" and repeatedly said she had received \"no votes.\"\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the 2020 Democratic primaries. Harris, then running for president, dropped out of the race before the first nomination battle, the Iowa caucuses. Her campaign was plagued by infighting and mismanagement.\n\nShe eventually became Biden's running mate.\n\n\"She was the first loser,\" Trump said. \"She was the first to give up, and she gave up. She had no votes, no support, and by the way, she was a bad debater, a very bad debater.\"\n\nTrump campaigns in Montana on Friday night.\n\nDonald Trump proposed three debates with Kamala Harris\n\nHarris also did not address criticism of Walz's military record in her brief conversations with reporters.\n\n\"Listen, I commend everyone who has volunteered to serve our country. And I think we all should,\" she said.\n\nMinnesota's governor was accused of deserting his National Guard unit after learning it was being deployed to Iraq.\n\nHe served in the Army National Guard for more than twenty years, which was one of the reasons he approached Harris, as he has no military experience whatsoever.\n\nThe timing of his retirement from the military became clear during his campaign for governor in 2018.\n\nRetired Minnesota National Guard Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends accused Walz of \"embellishing\" his record and abandoning his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\nWalz rejected the allegations, calling them a \"political attack from both sides.\"\n\n\"After serving for 20 years in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for another four years after 9/11. I retired the year before my battalion deployed to Iraq to run for Congress,\" he wrote at the time.\n\nWalz, 60, enlisted in the Guard at age 17.

PRICE AND ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON\n\nAssociated Press\n\nELECTION 2024\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. -- Donald Trump recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out, holding a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign is generating.\n\nAs the Republican presidential nominee addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, agreed to a Sept. 10 debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled election. Trump said he proposed three debates with three television networks in September.\n\nTrump again insisted there was a \"peaceful transfer\" of power in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Tim Walz, played up their support for organized labor at a Detroit-area union hall on Thursday, with the Democratic nominee saying \"we're all in this together\" as the new ticket lavishes attention on a crucial base of support.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have increasingly criticized Harris for not engaging extensively with journalists and taking questions during the early days of her candidacy. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Michigan, Harris said she talked with her aides and wants to schedule an interview before the end of the month.\n\nShe also confirmed that she would participate in a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News -- which Trump backed out of before recommitting to it Thursday -- and said she would be \"happy\" to discuss subsequent debates after that one occurs.\n\nHarris and Walz spoke to about 100 United Auto Workers members at Local 900 Hall, which represents Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant. The stop occurred shortly after Trump's news conference in Florida.\n\nAs she proclaimed that it was \"good to be in the house of labor,\" Harris described the value of unions, saying they were \"about understanding that no one should be made to fight alone\" and that \"hard work is good work.\"\n\n\"We have fun doing hard work, because we know what we stand for,\" she said. \"When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We know what we stand for, and we stand for the people and we stand for the dignity of work, and we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality.\"\n\nShe continued: \"And so we will fight for all of it.\"\n\nThe members at Local 900 were the first Ford workers to strike in 2023 when the union's contract with the company expired.\n\nWorkers at the assembly plant went on strike Sept. 15 and remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced a tentative agreement with Ford.\n\nAfter Biden ended his reelection campaign last month and endorsed his vice president, organized labor quickly rallied around Harris.\n\nThe AFL-CIO endorsed her after having first backed Biden. The UAW formally backed her last week.\n\nAnother key moment set\n\nTrump's decision to go on ABC, days after posting on his social media platform that he would not appear on the network, sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where Biden's catastrophic performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.\n\n\"I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight,\" he said.\n\nThursday's event was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Walz as her running mate. Trump called Walz a \"radical left man.\"\n\nHe repeatedly suggested Harris was not intelligent enough to debate him. Harris, for her part, has tried to goad Trump into debating and told an audience in Atlanta recently that if he had anything to say about her, he should \"say it to my face.\"\n\nTrump grew visibly perturbed when pressed on Harris' crowds and newfound Democratic enthusiasm, dismissing a question about his lighter campaign schedule as stupid.\n\nTrump says he has not \"recalibrated\" his campaign despite facing a new opponent, a dynamic some Republican strategists quietly complained about.\n\nWhen asked what assets Harris possessed, Trump said: \"She's a woman. She represents certain groups of people.\"\n\nQuestions about abortion\n\nTrump suggested abortion will not be a major issue in the campaign and the outcome in November.\n\nHe said the matter \"has become much less of an issue\" since the Supreme Court ended the federal constitutional right to abortion services and returned control of the matter to state governments. But abortion is widely seen as a general election liability, and Trump named states such as Ohio and Kansas that have since voted to protect abortion rights.\n\nTrump also said he expected Florida \"will go in a little more liberal way than people thought\" when it votes to repeal an abortion ban this year, but he did not respond to questions asking how he would vote.\n\nTrump argued that Democrats, Republicans and \"everybody\" are pleased with the results of the 2022 ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nFalse claims on Jan. 6\n\nDonald Trump falsely claimed during the press conference that \"nobody was killed on Jan. 6,\" the date in 2021 when pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol amid Congress' effort to certify Biden's 2020 election victory after Trump refused to concede.\n\nPolice shot and killed Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran from San Diego, as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot that breached the building.\n\nTrump has often cited Babbitt's death while lamenting the treatment of those who first attended a rally outside the White House that day, then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police and entered the building.\n\n\"I think those people were treated very badly. When you compare it to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed,\" Trump said Thursday, adding \"nobody was killed on Jan. 6.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "mcdowellnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McDowellNews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jill_colvin@mcdowellnews.com", "name": "Jill Colvin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michelle_l_price@mcdowellnews.com", "name": "Michelle L.

Tim Walz's military record after Vice President Kamala Harris named him as her running mate this week.\n\nHere's a look at the issue:\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. But it's his retirement in 2005 that's prompting criticism from some Republicans who are suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nA deadly tornado, flooding rains and swollen rivers plague residents in the path of Debby\n\nLUCAMA, N.C. (AP) -- Tornadoes spawned by Debby leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person early Thursday, as the tropical system dropped heavy rain and flooded communities across North and South Carolina.\n\nIt only took 15 seconds for a tornado to devastate Genesis Cooper's home in Lucama, North Carolina, a small town about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Raleigh. He almost slept through it -- if not for an alert on his wife's phone.\n\nHe, his wife and their 20-year-old son huddled in a bathroom with blankets. They felt vibrations and heard glass shattering before hearing a sudden boom.\n\n\"I can't even describe it. It's like, suction, that's what it felt like,\" Cooper said. \"Like something is squeezing, like your ears are popping.\"\n\nThe tornado was one of at least three reported overnight in North Carolina, and perhaps the most devastating. One person was found dead in a home damaged by the Lucama tornado, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email.

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and ended up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter racing on the world's biggest sports stage revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida, Austrian authorities said Thursday, and investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\"\n\nThree sold-out concerts were canceled Wednesday because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austria's expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium, which sat empty Thursday morning.\n\nEurope is enamored with the American superstar: The German town of Gelsenkirchen renamed itself \"Swiftkirchen\" before its mid-July concerts.\n\nConcert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Austria's interior minister, Gerhard Karner.\n\nAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer defended the decision to cancel the concerts, saying the arrests of the suspects took place too close to the shows, scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nWall Street rallies to its best day since 2022 on encouraging unemployment data; S&P 500 jumps 2.3%\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rallied Thursday in Wall Street's latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about the slowing economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 2.3% for its best day since 2022 and shaved off all but 0.5% of its loss from what was a brutal start to the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks helped lead the way.\n\nTreasury yields also climbed in the bond market in a signal investors are feeling less worried about the economy after a report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number was better than economists expected.\n\nIt was exactly a week ago that worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims helped enflame worries that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at too high of an economy-slowing level for too long in order to beat inflation. That helped send markets reeling, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that sent shockwaves worldwide by scrambling a favorite trade among some hedge funds.\n\nAt the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down nearly 10% from its all-time high set last month. Such drops are regular occurrences on Wall Street, and \"corrections\" of 10% happen roughly every year or two. After Thursday's jump, the index is back within about 6% of its record.\n\nDNA on weapons implicates ex-U.S. Green Beret in attempted Venezuelan coup, federal officials say\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- Federal investigators say they found the DNA of a decorated former U.S. Green Beret on some of the 60 automatic weapons he allegedly smuggled from Florida to South America as part of a failed 2020 coup attempt against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nThe allegations were detailed in court papers filed days after Jordan Goudreau's arrest last week and contain the strongest evidence yet linking him to illegal arms trafficking that facilitated the amphibious raid, which ended with several fighters killed and two of Goudreau's former U.S. Special Forces colleagues locked away for years in Venezuela.\n\nThe plot, exposed by The Associated Press two days before the incursion, was carried out by a ragtag group of Venezuelan army deserters whom Goudreau allegedly helped arm and train in neighboring Colombia. Goudreau later claimed responsibility for the putsch, but said he was acting in concert with the Venezuelan opposition to protect democracy. He also said he was in touch with then-President Donald Trump's administration, which made no secret of its desire to see Maduro gone, even though there's no evidence U.S. officials blessed the invasion.\n\nAfter Goudreau's arrest in New York last week, a federal magistrate initially allowed filmmaker Jen Gatien to put up her $2 million Manhattan loft as bond to secure Goudreau's release. But prosecutors appealed and now it's up to a judge in Tampa, Florida, where Goudreau was indicted, to determine whether he should remain behind bars pending trial.\n\nProsecutors arguing that Goudreau is a flight risk presented what they called \"overwhelming\" evidence that he knowingly violated U.S. arms control laws, and that he tried to hide after learning he was under investigation. Those efforts including moving his bank accounts into cryptocurrency, obtaining a Mexican driver's license and allegedly sneaking back and forth across the U.S. border into Mexico and Canada, where he was born and lived until emigrating and enlisting in the U.S. Army.\n\nThird person dies in listeria outbreak tied to Boar's Head deli meats\n\nThree people have now died in a listeria food poisoning outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meats, federal food safety officials announced Thursday, and the overall number of people sickened rose to 43.\n\nThe additional death happened in Virginia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a news release Thursday. The other two deaths were in New Jersey and Illinois. The CDC also said nine more cases were reported since a July 31 release about the outbreak, which started in late May.\n\nBoar's Head recalled 7 million pounds of deli meats on July 30, expanding an initial recall on July 25 after a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. The CDC said Thursday that a New York health officials tested a liverwurst sample and confirmed the same strain of listeria.\n\nThe recall includes more than 70 products -- including liverwurst, ham, beef salami and bologna -- made at the company's plant in Jarratt, Virginia.\n\nBoar's Head already faces two lawsuits over the outbreak, one in a Missouri court and the other a class action suit in federal court in New York.\n\nWhite Sox fire manager Pedro Grifol after end of 21-game losing streak that tied AL record\n\nCHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox are on course to finish with baseball's worst record of the modern era. Change clearly is needed.\n\nThe White Sox made a switch in the dugout, firing manager Pedro Grifol and three coaches on Thursday, two days after the team ended a 21-game losing streak that tied the American League record.\n\nChicago began the day 28-89, on pace to finish 39-123, which would be the worst major league record since the National League's Cleveland Spiders were 20-134 in 1899.\n\nThe White Sox ended the losing streak with a 5-1 victory at Oakland on Tuesday night, then wasted a two-run lead in a 3-2 loss on Wednesday. The 21 losses tied the mark set when the 1988 Baltimore Orioles started 0-21.\n\n\"We know the flaws in this roster,\" general manager Chris Getz said. \"But with that being said, we expected to win more games -- we did. These factors led to the decision.\"\n\nThe Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "timescolonist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Colonist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nFACT FOCUS: A look at claims made by Trump at news conference\n\nIn his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, former President Donald Trump said he would debate her on Sept. 10 and pushed for two more debates. The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before.\n\nHarris and Walz show their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nWAYNE, Mich.

Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz spoke Thursday to several dozen United Auto Workers members. Harris and Walz are making joint campaign appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will decide the November election against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. Michigan is one of those states and organized labor is a crucial base of support for Democrats.\n\nA deadly tornado, flooding rains and swollen rivers plague residents in the path of Debby\n\nLUCAMA, N.C. (AP) -- Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. At least three tornadoes fueled by the tropical system were reported overnight in North Carolina. Perhaps the worst has been in Lucama, a small town about 40 miles east of Raleigh. A person was found dead in a home damaged by the tornado. Other residents recounted hunkering down in their homes as the tornado ripped through overnight. Businesses about 100 miles away in the small town of Bladenboro flooded from heavy rains from Debby. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.\n\nMaui remembers the 102 lost in the Lahaina wildfire with a paddle out 1 year after devastating blaze\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of Maui surfers, canoe paddlers and boat riders made their way into the ocean off Lahaina, Hawaii, on Thursday to remember the 102 people killed when the nation's deadliest wildfire in more than a century destroyed the historic town one year ago. The \"paddle out\" gathering is a ritual observed in Hawaii in honor of loved ones. Boat riders dropped flower petals in the sea while surfers splashed water in the air. Spectators watched from a beach park on shore. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green says Maui is still grieving for those lost in the Aug. 8, 2023, fire.\n\nCould 2 NASA astronauts be stuck at the space station until next year? Here's what to know\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA is wrestling over how and when to bring two astronauts back from the International Space Station after running into trouble with their new Boeing capsule. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been up there since early June, two months longer than planned. Their stay could now stretch into next year, if NASA decides the thrusters on Boeing's Starliner cannot be trusted to safely bring them home. Plan B is SpaceX. If necessary, NASA says it will remove two of the four astronauts due to launch to the space station next month The empty seats would be for Wilmore and Williams, but they wouldn't come back until February.\n\nWall Street rallies to its best day since 2022 on encouraging unemployment data; S&P 500 jumps 2.3%\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rallied to their best day since 2022 in Wall Street's latest sharp swerve. The S&P 500 jumped 2.3% Thursday after a better-than-expected report on unemployment calmed worries about the slowing economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.9%. Treasury yields also climbed in the bond market, a signal that investors are feeling less worried about the economy, after a report showed fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Eli Lilly helped lead the market after delivering better profit for the spring than expected, while Big Tech stocks rebounded.\n\nUS men's basketball team rallies to beat Serbia at Paris Olympics, will face France for gold medal\n\nPARIS (AP) -- With six points in two seconds, the U.S. Olympic team was on its way. To a comeback. To a win. And to another Olympic gold medal game. Stephen Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. will play for gold in the Paris Olympics on Saturday night after beating Serbia 95-91. The U.S. trailed by 17 points in the first half, plus faced an 11-point halftime deficit -- the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992. Curry says \"that was a special one.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief Executive Officer\n\nSecured Signing Notary Community platform enables notaries to connect

The Harris campaign had already opposed a Fox debate, saying the host network should be one that sponsored recent primary debates by both parties.\n\nTrump previously suggested he might back out of the ABC (DIS.N), scheduled before Harris, the U.S. vice president, replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate less than three weeks ago, upending the contest. The Sept. 10 debate on ABC was to be the second of two agreed upon between Biden and Trump, following their June 27 debate on CNN.\n\nAn Ipsos poll published on Thursday found Harris has widened her lead over Trump since late July. She leads Trump 42% to 37%, compared with a July 22-23 Reuters/Ipsos survey that showed her up 37% to 34% over Trump.\n\nThursday's Palm Beach news conference was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nHarris and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a fresh sign of how her late entry into the race has galvanized Democrats. Thursday's stop by the Democratic pair at a union hall came as the campaign said it sees labor groups as a key to tipping the balance in the election.\n\nHarris' rapid rise has sent Trump's team scrambling to recalibrate its strategy and messaging. Opinion polls show Harris has erased the lead Trump had built over Biden, and Democrats have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from voters and big donors since she became the party's candidate.\n\nTrump insisted on Thursday he has not altered his approach to the race. In a question-and-answer session with reporters that stretched beyond an hour, Trump hopped from topic to topic and said Harris and Walz are weak candidates.\n\nNevertheless, Trump lamented that he isn't able to face Biden in the Nov. 5 election, suggesting the president was a victim of a plot to dislodge him from atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nBiden dropped his faltering reelection bid under pressure from fellow Democrats worried about his chances of victory after a poor debate performance against Trump.\n\nAsked about his controversial comments last week that Harris, who is of Black and Indian decent, recently \"happened to turn Black,\" Trump said: \"You'll have to ask her that question, because she's the one that said it, I didn't say it. ... To me it doesn't matter. But to her, from her standpoint, I think it's very disrespectful to both, really, whether it's Indian or Black, I think it's very disrespectful to both.\"\n\nTrump's initial comments, delivered to an audience of Black journalists, drew widespread condemnation and left donors and aides baffled and alarmed. The Trump campaign didn't immediately comment further to provide evidence of remarks by Harris that Trump said he was referring to.\n\nTrump on Thursday also mocked the size of Harris' campaign crowds, even though they have matched his of late. He falsely claimed the size of the crowd he addressed on Jan. 6, 2021 - the day his supporters stormed the US Capitol - was as large as those who packed the National Mall in Washington for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech in 1963.\n\n\"We actually had more people,\" Trump said, according to Reuters. \"But I'm ok with it, because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.\"\n\nKing delivered his speech to an estimated 250,000 people in August 1963, according to the National Constitution Center. Trump's rally on Jan. 6, 2021, drew about 53,000 supporters, according to the House of Representatives Select Committee's \"187 minutes of dereliction\" report.\n\nEchoing a recent attack line from his campaign, Trump criticized Harris for not doing a press interview since launching her campaign.\n\n\"She can't do an interview. She's barely competent,\" Trump said, later again calling her \"nasty,\" a go-to line that he often uses to disparage female critics.\n\nTrump has conducted a steady stream of media interviews, though they are usually with friendly, right-leaning outlets and reporters. On Wednesday, he called into the \"Fox & Friends\" morning program and took questions from the program's hosts.\n\nTrump announced the Palm Beach news conference on Thursday morning on his social media platform. Only a select group of reporters were given the advance notice needed to travel to his Florida resort in time. Reuters was not extended an invitation.\n\nHarris answered a handful of questions from reporters after meeting with auto workers in Wayne, Michigan, on Thursday, following the United Auto Workers union's endorsement of her candidacy. She said she wants to schedule a sit-down interview \"before the end of the month.\"", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nFACT FOCUS: A look at claims made by Trump at news conference\n\nIn his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, former President Donald Trump said he would debate her on Sept. 10 and pushed for two more debates. The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before.\n\nHarris and Walz show their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall\n\nWAYNE, Mich.

Harris and Walz are making joint campaign appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will decide the November election against Republican Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. Michigan is one of those states and organized labor is a crucial base of support for Democrats.\n\nA deadly tornado, flooding rains and swollen rivers plague residents in the path of Debby\n\nLUCAMA, N.C. (AP) -- Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. At least three tornadoes fueled by the tropical system were reported overnight in North Carolina. Perhaps the worst has been in Lucama, a small town about 40 miles east of Raleigh. A person was found dead in a home damaged by the tornado. Other residents recounted hunkering down in their homes as the tornado ripped through overnight. Businesses about 100 miles away in the small town of Bladenboro flooded from heavy rains from Debby. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows.\n\nUS men's basketball team rallies to beat Serbia at Paris Olympics, will face France for gold medal\n\nPARIS (AP) -- With six points in two seconds, the U.S. Olympic team was on its way.

Curry says \"that was a special one.\"\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.\n\nCould 2 NASA astronauts be stuck at the space station until next year? Here's what to know\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA is wrestling over how and when to bring two astronauts back from the International Space Station after running into trouble with their new Boeing capsule. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been up there since early June, two months longer than planned. Their stay could now stretch into next year, if NASA decides the thrusters on Boeing's Starliner cannot be trusted to safely bring them home. Plan B is SpaceX.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.9%. Treasury yields also climbed in the bond market, a signal that investors are feeling less worried about the economy, after a report showed fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Eli Lilly helped lead the market after delivering better profit for the spring than expected, while Big Tech stocks rebounded.\n\nThird person dies in listeria outbreak tied to Boar's Head deli meats\n\nFederal food safety officials say three people have now died in a listeria food poisoning outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meats.

I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.'\n\nShe did not indicate a more specific date or what news outlet she would sit down with.\n\nKamala Harris said she would sit down for a media interview by the end of August\n\nHarris is spending Friday campaigning in Arizona as part of her battleground state tour with running mate Tim Walz.\n\nShe spoke to journalists traveling with her, taking questions shortly after her Republican rival Donald Trump held an hour-long press conference at his Florida home of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump alleged that Harris is 'not smart enough to do a news conference.'\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Trump says he has agreed to do THREE MORE debates with Kamala Harris\n\n'And I'm sorry, we need smart people to lead this country.'\n\nHarris did not address a few topics when asked about them by reporters, including criticism of Walz for his military record.\n\nBut the Democratic nominee confirmed she will Trump on September 10th, a debate that will be hosted by ABC News.\n\nBut she did not agree to Trump's proposal for two more debates: Sept. 4 with Fox News or Sept. 25 with NBC.\n\nIn fact, she seemed to indicate the September 4th debate was off the table, noting she wanted see if Trump shows up for the Sept. 10 event before making a decision.\n\n'I am happy to have that conversation about an additional debate after September 10, for sure,' she said.\n\nTrump skipped all the Republican primary debates and pulled out of one debate with Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The former president also had exited the ABC debate, which he originally agreed to when Biden was still the nominee, before re-agreeing to attend.\n\nHarris wouldn't comment on Trump's wide-ranging freewheeling press conference on Thursday, saying she didn't see it because she was too busy talking to voters. Harris was campaigning in Michigan at the time.\n\n'I am beyond trying to speculate about how he thinks,' she said when asked about some of Trump's criticism.\n\nTrump was visibly angry at points in his press conference. He slammed his Democratic rival repeatedly, calling her the 'politically correct' choice for a nominee, questioning her intellect and questioning if she should be on the ticket.\n\nHe dubbed her the 'first loser' and said repeatedly she had gotten 'no votes.'\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the 2020 Democratic primary contest. Harris, who was running for president at the time, dropped out of the race before the first nominating contest, which was Iowa's caucuses. Her campaign had been plagued by infighting and bad management.\n\nShe eventually became Biden's running mate.\n\n'She was the first loser,' Trump said. 'She was the first one to quit, and she quit. She had no votes, no support, and she was a bad debater, by the way, very bad debater.'\n\nTrump will be campaigning in Montana on Friday night.\n\nDonald Trump proposed three debates with Kamala Harris\n\nHarris, in her short back-and-forth with reporters, also didn't address criticism of Walz's military record.\n\n'Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country. And I think that we all should,' she said.\n\nThe Minnesota governor was accused of quiting his National Guard unit after it was informed it was being deployed for Iraq.\n\nHe served for more than two decades in the Army National Guard, and that was part of his appeal to Harris, who has no military experience.\n\nThe timing of his separation from the military surfaced during his 2018 campaign for governor.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\nWalz dismissed the charges, calling them a 'bipartisan political attack.'\n\n'After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,' he wrote at the time.\n\nWalz, 60, enlisted in the Guard at the age of 17. He became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I hope to see him there.\" Harris has yet to agree to the other proposals.\n\nIn May, Biden and Trump had initially agreed to debate on CNN and ABC, but Trump pulled out of the ABC debate owing to a perceived conflict of interest over a defamation lawsuit Trump had filed in March 19 against ABC and its news host George Stephanopoulos.\n\nThe CNN debate with Biden on June 27, didn't fair well for Biden, and after pressure from fellow Democrats, he later pulled out of the race, nominating Harris as his replacement.\n\nThe initial rules for the televised debates were based on a minimum of 15 percent support in two qualifying national polls as stipulated by CNN.\n\nCandidates' names would also have to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the general election, criteria met by both the Republican and Democrat parties.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't meet the initial requirement to appear on CNN but has since said that he has ballot access in more than 40 states. It is not yet known whether he will appear at the ABC debate.\n\nThe electoral college is a voting system unique to the United States, in which each state has a number of electors based on that state's representation in congress. When people vote they are voting for these electors, and the presidential candidate with more than 270 electors wins the vote.\n\nHarris's official nomination has come just in time for the Democratic National Convention which will be held in Chicago on from Aug. 19-22.\n\nEvery four years, the two major U.S. political parties hold their own conventions running up to the presidential elections to officially nominate a president and vice president to run for their party.\n\nThe Republican National Convention was held on July 15-18.\n\nPresidential debates are a custom in the United States, with nominees discussing their responses to a range of current topics.

Tim Walz, Trump suddenly seems like old news, a crushing new experience for a former president who prides himself on leading the narrative.\n\nA major test for both candidates\n\nThe lead-up to the September 10 debate, assuming it happens, will be intense, and the truncated nature of the new campaign means it could create another historic pivot point on the winding road to the White House.\n\nTrump is already playing his idiosyncratic expectations game by disparaging the skills of his opponent, who could be the first Black woman and South Asian president. At a news conference Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort, he compared Harris unfavorably to Biden, whom he has long argued lacks the mental acuity to serve. \"She's actually not as smart as he is. I don't think he's very smart either, by the way. I'm not a big fan of his brain,\" Trump said.\n\nThe matchup also promises to be an extreme test for Harris. The vice president has a mixed record in debates, where she performed strongly early in her failed 2020 presidential campaign. But on other occasions, she has struggled. And her most unflattering moments in office have come when she has been asked to explain her positions or answer tough questions in key interviews.\n\nBut as she gains confidence as a Democratic candidate, Harris is a more accomplished politician than she was four years ago, and her supporters are eager to see her use her skills as a former prosecutor to take on the four-time indicted former president.\n\nHarris criticized Trump for changing his mind about the ABC debate and said she was happy to have a conversation about a second meeting later. \"I'm glad he finally agreed to a debate on September 10th. I look forward to that and I hope he'll be there,\" she told reporters before boarding Air Force Two in Detroit.\n\nAfter Harris upended the campaign in less than three weeks, Trump showed at his press conference that he was still searching for an effective response.\n\nThe former president appears to be mourning the fight against Biden, 81, and denying the early success of the new, energetic Democratic ticket. Asked why he wasn't doing more to campaign and counter Harris's frantic campaign rollout, Trump replied: \"I'm way ahead and I'm letting their convention play out.\" He insisted he hadn't recalibrated his strategy at all, as he made the same arguments that the United States is overwhelmed by open borders and immigrant crime.\n\nBut there is a growing sense that her campaign needs such a reboot. Harris has erased the former president's previous advantage over Biden, with the race now neck and neck in the latest CNN poll of polls. A new Marquette Law School poll released Thursday morning found Harris leading 52% to Trump's 48% among registered voters nationally.\n\nTrump's problem isn't that there aren't strong arguments against Harris and her new running mate: Millions of Americans are suffering from rising prices and are hounded by economic insecurity. The world is an increasingly dangerous place as America's enemies unite to challenge Washington's power. And Harris is intimately tied to everything the unpopular Biden administration has done on these issues. The new Democratic team has not proposed concrete policies to address these problems, and the vice president has yet to take detailed questions from reporters or give a major television interview. And many Republicans and right-wing independents are receptive to Trump's arguments about the crisis at the southern border, even though arrivals of undocumented migrants have declined since Biden stepped up enforcement earlier this year.\n\nBut Trump fails to make these arguments effectively because he is stewing over his personal grievances. His typically off-kilter press conference at one point even featured a comparison between the size of his audience and that of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe former president also appears willing to run for reelection if he loses, falsely insisting Thursday that the Democratic Party's nomination change was unconstitutional. \"We have a Constitution. It's a very important document, and we live by it,\" Trump said, seemingly unaware of the irony of such comments coming from a former president who tried to steal the 2020 election and threatened the fabric of American democracy.\n\nIn a statement, Harris' campaign tried to portray Trump's ramblings as evidence that he is losing, at a time when it has sought to portray Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance, as odd people.\n\nDonald Trump took a break to put on pants and hold a public news conference, the campaign said in a statement that included the walkout. He hasn't campaigned all week. He won't be traveling to any key states this week. But he's really angry that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are drawing big crowds to battleground states.\n\nTrump's strategy Thursday was familiar. He reinserted himself into a news cycle he was losing with a dark, dystopian message. \"We are living in the most dangerous time I have ever known for our country,\" he said, and he predicted a Great Depression and World War III if he is not elected.\n\nHer return to the politics of fear and her dark tales of American carnage contrast with the lightness and joy that erupted at huge Democratic rallies this week after Harris named her as her running mate and they embarked on a joint journey through the key states that will decide November's election.\n\nDespite fears of a recession, unemployment currently stands at 4.3% and economic growth is solid. No credible economist predicts a return to the 25% unemployment rate of the 1930s. And with American power challenged by dictatorial leaders in Russia, China and North Korea, and wars raging in the Middle East and Ukraine, there is no sign that a third world conflagration is imminent.\n\nThe mood of the 2024 campaign has shifted with remarkable speed. Three weeks ago, on Thursday, Republican delegates left their convention in Milwaukee optimistic about Trump's chances, with many predicting a landslide election victory after his provocative response to an assassination attempt supercharged his campaign.\n\nTrump seems stuck in a political paralysis today. But he is unlikely to stay that way. His entire political career, and his 2024 campaign in particular, have been a textbook case of how he has seized on near-existential threats and used them for political gain. After all, this is a former president who exploited a mug shot taken in a Georgia prison to build a primary campaign that crushed his rivals on the grounds that he was the victim of political gain.\n\nHarris' success so far has been in bringing the election back to a close race in a polarized nation.\n\nBut despite the crowd's enthusiasm this week, the vice president has yet to prove herself in the fiery heat of a national presidential election. And the road to 270 electoral votes for Democrats still appears fraught with challenges, even if there are signs that the vice president could reclaim some battlegrounds.\n\nTrump advisers insisted Thursday that an early rebound from Harris was expected.\n\n\"They're celebrating the return of voters they should have had in the first place,\" one official told reporters. \"They know, as we do, that the fundamentals of the race have not changed.\" The official added: \"When you ask voters whether they prefer to go back to the Trump economy or stay with the Biden economy, we win two to one.\"\n\nThis is why many Republicans believe that their version of reality will soon take over.\n\nThe honeymoon period will soon end, Trump insisted Thursday.\n\nBut the former president shows little sign that he knows how to do it.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"},

Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person.

(AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nTimeline of events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk. After words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Months of unrest followed. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by less than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz officially steps down later this year to accept the position of U.S. vice president, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the first Native woman to govern a state. Flanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and became the highest ranking Native American statewide official in the country when she was elected to office in 2018. She has helped shape Walz's administration as one focused on improving tribal sovereignty and autonomy across Minnesota. She is one of several Indigenous women who have taken seats of power in the U.S. over the past decade, and many in Indian Country see her rise to power as an opportunity for increased Indigenous rights and visibility.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nFACT FOCUS: A look at claims made by Trump at news conference\n\nIn his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, former President Donald Trump said he would debate her on Sept. 10 and pushed for two more debates. The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before.\n\nVeteran human rights advocate freed in swap says Russia is sliding back toward Stalinist times\n\nBERLIN (AP) -- A human rights activist since the 1980s, Oleg Orlov thought Russia had turned a corner when the Soviet Union collapsed and a democratically elected president became leader. But then Vladimir Putin rose to power, crushing dissent and launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finally, the 71-year-old Orlov was himself thrown in prison for opposing the war. Freed last week in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War, Orlov told The Associated Press that Russia is backsliding toward the days of dictator Josef Stalin. He is vowing to work from exile to try to free as many political prisoners as possible and keep their cases in the spotlight.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.\n\nMaui remembers the 102 lost in the Lahaina wildfire with a paddle out 1 year after devastating blaze\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of Maui surfers, canoe paddlers and boat riders made their way into the ocean off Lahaina, Hawaii, on Thursday to remember the 102 people killed when the nation's deadliest wildfire in more than a century destroyed the historic town one year ago. The \"paddle out\" gathering is a ritual observed in Hawaii in honor of loved ones. Boat riders dropped flower petals in the sea while surfers splashed water in the air. Spectators watched from a beach park on shore. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green says Maui is still grieving for those lost in the Aug. 8, 2023, fire.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Debby's final chapter involves moving north and northeast from the Carolinas at a faster clip with soaking rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes into the weekend. Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nTimeline of events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk. After words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Months of unrest followed. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by less than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz officially steps down later this year to accept the position of U.S. vice president, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the first Native woman to govern a state.

She has helped shape Walz's administration as one focused on improving tribal sovereignty and autonomy across Minnesota.

In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nFACT FOCUS: A look at claims made by Trump at news conference\n\nIn his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, former President Donald Trump said he would debate her on Sept. 10 and pushed for two more debates. The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before.\n\nMaui remembers the 102 lost in the Lahaina wildfire with a paddle out 1 year after devastating blaze\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of Maui surfers, canoe paddlers and boat riders made their way into the ocean off Lahaina, Hawaii, on Thursday to remember the 102 people killed when the nation's deadliest wildfire in more than a century destroyed the historic town one year ago. The \"paddle out\" gathering is a ritual observed in Hawaii in honor of loved ones. Boat riders dropped flower petals in the sea while surfers splashed water in the air. Spectators watched from a beach park on shore. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green says Maui is still grieving for those lost in the Aug. 8, 2023, fire.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.\n\nSuspects in foiled attack on Taylor Swift shows were inspired by Islamic State group, officials say\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities say both suspects in a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift shows in Vienna appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. They said Thursday that investigators found bomb-making materials at one of their homes. Officials said one of the two confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\" Three sold-out concerts were canceled a day earlier because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe, many of whom had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging to attend the Eras Tour shows.", "source": {"uri": "wsiltv.com", "dataType":

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nBiden and Trump agreed in May to a set of rules for both the CNN debate and the Sept. 10 ABC News debate, including no live studio audience, muted microphones when the candidates aren't speaking and hosts selected from the networks' regular personnel. It's unclear whether these rules will carry over.\n\nTrump said Thursday he also agreed to a Sept. 4 debate on Fox News and that the ABC debate would be Sept. 25. His campaign quickly clarified the ABC debate would be Sept.10 and NBC News would host the Sept. 25 debate, though Harris has only agreed to the Sept. 10 debate so far. An NBC spokesperson also indicated the date Trump floated was not official, according to CBS News, which reported the spokesperson said the network has had conversations with both campaigns about a range of dates.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad that he finally agreed to a debate on Sept. 10. I'm looking forward to it and I hope he shows up,\" Harris told reporters Thursday, adding that she is open to scheduling an additional debate.\n\nTrump said Thursday CBS News would host a vice presidential debate between Vance and Walz. Harris, when running alongside Biden, had previously agreed to debate Trump's yet-to-be-announced running mate on CBS, though a Vance-Walz debate has not been announced. Both Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, and GOP vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have said they want to debate each other, but Vance has said he wants to do so after Democrats officially nominate Walz, which they're expected to do at their convention in Chicago Aug. 19-22.\n\nTrump's June 27 debate with President Joe Biden marked a seismic shift in the election that ultimately ended with Biden abandoning his re-election bid less than a month later and endorsing Harris as his replacement. Harris has made inroads on Trump's polling lead over Biden in the weeks since announcing her candidacy, and now leads by a narrow margin in most polling averages. Much of the focus in the election during the past two weeks has centered around the candidates' choices for running mates. Trump announced Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his pick for vice president just before the Republican National Convention began on July 18, while Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nTrump Reverses Course: Offers 3 Debates With Harris -- Including ABC Debate He Called Off (Forbes)\n\nTrump Pledges He'll Debate Harris In 'Pretty Near Future' -- After Backing Out Of ABC Debate (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b6354f963f516046b49503/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802917", "eventUri": "eng-9802917", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 1984, "textEnd": 1994}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 506, "textEnd": 514, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 769, "textEnd": 776}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-25", "textStart": 829, "textEnd": 837, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2005, "textEnd": 2012}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 2621, "textEnd": 2628}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-09-", "textStart": 894, "textEnd": 901}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

That could happen.\" He expressed concerns over the lack of respect from other nations, citing Russia, China, and North Korea as examples.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112406025,width-1070,height-580,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802917", "eventUri": "eng-9802917", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "dateEnd": "2024-09-25", "textStart": 319, "textEnd": 339}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 98, "textEnd": 106}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

There was no immediate word from the Harris camp about the other proposed dates, the first with Trump-friendly Fox News and the final with NBC News.\n\nTrump revived a series of familiar attacks on his opponent -- repeatedly questioning the intelligence of the former state attorney general and US senator, in an event punctuated by falsehoods.\n\nTrump made untrue claims on all manner of topics around the election and his record in office, from the price of gasoline to his crowd sizes, US military deaths in Afghanistan and the 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol by his supporters.\n\nHe assured reporters there would be a peaceful transfer of power after the November 5 vote -- but questioned whether the election would be honest and claimed that the last transfer had been peaceful, despite the deadly Capitol riot.\n\nTrump also rejected a suggestion that he would need to recalibrate his campaign to take account of his new opponent after Harris replaced President Joe Biden on the ticket on July 21. \"It's the same policies, open borders, weak on crime. She is, I think, she's worse than Biden,\" he said.\n\nThe former president's debate with a dismally performing Biden in June spelled the end of the veteran Democrat's reelection campaign, but Trump had been reluctant to face Harris on neutral territory.\n\nThe 78-year-old has been struggling to come up with effective attack lines to define Harris while delivering a series of increasingly confounding nicknames for his opponent.\n\nThe news conference was his first public appearance since Harris -- a generation younger than Trump at 59 -- announced running mate Tim Walz and embarked on a tour of closely fought election battlegrounds.\n\nShe and Walz appeared Thursday in Michigan ahead of a trip to the racially diverse \"Sun Belt\" states of Arizona and Nevada for rallies on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down. It's based on who you lift up,\" she told a crowd of around 170 supporters in Detroit, at a much smaller event than her recent arena rallies.\n\nSabato's Crystal Ball, a leading election forecaster, shifted three of its ratings in favor of Democrats on Wednesday, moving Minnesota and New Hampshire from \"leans Democratic\" to \"likely Democratic\" and Georgia from \"leans Republican\" to \"toss-up.\"\n\nMeanwhile Marquette University Law School released a nationwide survey showing that, among likely voters, Harris now leads Trump by six points -- 53 percent to 47 percent.\n\nDespite her intensive campaign schedule, Harris has taken almost no questions from reporters since entering the race and Trump had been seeking to turn her lack of media exposure into an election issue even before Thursday's news conference.\n\n\"She hasn't done an interview -- she can't do an interview, she's barely competent... But I look forward to the debates, because I think we have to set the record straight,\" he said in Florida.\n\nHarris said later Thursday: \"I've talked to my team. I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"Harris blitzes battlegrounds as Trump schedule raises eyebrows", "body": "Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz greet supporters at a campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin\n\nDonald Trump was to campaign Friday in a safe Republican state as Kamala Harris barnstorms the battlegrounds likely to decide November's election, carried by surge in momentum that has left her opponent scrambling.\n\nWith election day just three months away, Trump's light schedule -- a rally every four or five days -- has been contrasted with the hectic program of an opponent almost 20 years his junior, and his with own vigorous campaigning in 2016.\n\nThe 78-year-old tycoon has held just five rallies since the Republican National Convention concluded in mid-July -- one fewer than Harris is staging this week alone -- and has no events at all announced yet for next week.\n\nEight years ago, Trump was staging multiple events a day by August, but the oldest major party presidential nominee in US history is venturing out of Florida for the first time this week for a rally in Montana, a state he should win easily.\n\nThe ex-president -- who survived an assassination attempt at a rally last month -- bristled at questions over his schedule in a hastily-convened press conference at his home in south Florida Thursday.\n\nHe said he had been absent from battleground states because he was \"leading by a lot and because I'm letting their convention go through,\" a reference to the Democratic National Convention, which doesn't end until August 22.\n\n- 'Low energy' -\n\nThe Harris campaign called the ex-president \"low energy\" --- a favorite Trump insult -- while his former communications chief Alyssa Farah Griffin bemoaned Republicans not picking a \"younger, more vibrant candidate.\"\n\nTrump appeared on track to win back the White House before Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, but Harris has made big gains since replacing the president at the top of the ticket and naming running mate Tim Walz.\n\nHer rise appears to have wrongfooted Trump, who dismissed her surging polling numbers as he held court in front of journalists at his Mar-a-Lago estate for a free-wheeling hour-plus news conference.\n\nHe complained about coverage of Harris's large crowds and assailed her for avoiding holding her own media availability.\n\nAnd in a bizarre moment that made headlines, he related an anecdote about a helicopter near-miss that never happened, in which he appeared to confuse former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown with former California governor Jerry Brown.\n\nHe pitched three September debates -- mixing up the dates of the showdowns he was proposing -- and attacked Harris as unintelligent and incompetent.\n\nFormer prosecutor Harris -- praised for her forensic questioning as a senator and for her performance in the vice-presidential debate in 2020 -- immediately confirmed one of the dates, an ABC face-off on September 10.\n\n- 'Unify and organize' -\n\nMeanwhile Harris continues her tour of the swing states alongside Walz, with a stop in the racially diverse Southwestern battlegrounds of Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Saturday.\n\nFormerly worried White House aides have begun to rekindle their enthusiasm over the possibility of victory in the two states, which were shifted this week from \"lean Republican\" to \"toss up\" by election forecaster Cook Political Report.\n\nThe first large survey of Latino voters with Harris as the presumptive nominee -- commissioned by voter engagement group Somos PAC -- showed Harris leading Trump by 18 points in the battleground states.\n\n\"The stakes of this election require Latinos to unify and organize together like our lives depend on it,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said, welcoming Harris's endorsement by the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nPolicy has taken a backseat in an election overwhelmed in recent weeks by Biden's disastrous debate performance, the assassination bid on Trump and Harris surge.\n\nBut Harris and Biden will discuss tackling inflation -- a top concern for voters and a winning issue for Trump -- in Maryland next week at their first joint campaign trip since the president's withdrawal.\n\nft/bgs", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [],

(AP) -- Debby's final chapter involves moving north and northeast from the Carolinas at a faster clip with soaking rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes into the weekend. Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend. The South Carolina town of Moncks Corner was hit early Friday by flash flooding. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday.\n\nIran is accelerating cyber activity that appears meant to influence the US election, Microsoft says\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A new report from Microsoft finds that Iran is accelerating online activity that appears intended to influence the U.S. election. Friday's report finds that Iranian actors have recently created fake news sites, impersonated activists and in one case targeted a U.S. presidential campaign official with an email phishing attack. Microsoft says the activity shows how Iran is laying the groundwork to stoke division and potentially sway American voters this fall. U.S. intelligence officials say Russia continues to pose the greatest threat for election disinformation, while Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously. Iran's United Nations mission denied that it plans cyberattacks or other interference in the U.S. election.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nRussia declares a federal emergency in a border region that is under attack from Ukrainian forces\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia's Ministry for Emergencies has declared the situation in the Kursk region a \"federal level\" emergency. The announcement came four days after hundreds of Ukrainian troops poured over the border in what appeared to be Kyiv's biggest attack on Russian soil since the war began. Meanwhile, authorities in eastern Ukraine said a Russian plane-launched missile hit a shopping mall late morning Friday, killing at least nine people and injuring 26. The mall is located in a town's residential area. Thick black smoke rose above it after the strike. Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said it was \"another act of terror by the Russians.\"\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nIsraeli troops launch a new assault into Gaza's Khan Younis as mediators push for cease-fire talks\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israeli troops have launched a new assault into the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military says they're targeting Hamas fighters who they claim still operate there despite repeated offensives. American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have renewed their push for Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire deal. Israel said it would attend Aug. 15 talks called by the mediators. Evacuation orders triggered another exodus of Palestinians from eastern districts of Khan Younis. Israeli officials have said they believe Hamas' newly appointed top leader, Yahya Sinwar, could be hiding there.\n\nHearing in Karen Read case expected to focus on jury deliberations\n\nDEDHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the Karen Read case are set to return to court with the focus expected to be on jury deliberations that led to a mistrial on charges she killed her police officer boyfriend. Read is accused of ramming into John O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him for dead in a January 2022 snowstorm. The defense contends four jurors have said the jury unanimously reached a not guilty verdict on second-degree murder and leaving the scene of a deadly accident and were deadlocked on the remaining manslaughter charge. The hearing is scheduled for Friday afternoon.\n\n3rd person in custody over foiled plot targeting now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities have announced a third arrest in connection with the foiled conspiracy to attack three now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts even as disappointed fans charmed Vienna by trading friendship bracelets and singing the popstar's famous songs in the streets. The main suspect planned to target onlookers gathered outside Ernst Happel Stadium with knives or homemade explosives during the concert on Thursday or Friday. Authorities say the scheme was inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. Swift is set to travel to London's Wembley stadium for five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.\n\nBoxer Imane Khelif fights for gold to cap an Olympics filled with misinformed scrutiny\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Imane Khelif is one victory away from wrapping up her tumultuous Paris Olympics with a gold medal around her neck after enduring waves of online abuse over misconceptions about her sex. Khelif fights Yang Liu of China in the final of the women's welterweight division. The vitriol against Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association disqualifying them from last year's world championships. The sport's governing body has been banned from the Olympics and claimed both fighters had failed murky eligibility tests for women's competition. The International Olympic Committee has called the arbitrary sex tests imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

Both candidates will take to the ABC News stage to discuss their values and policies if they are elected President. According to a statement released by the network, reported by CNN, \"Vice President Harris and former President Trump have both confirmed they will attend the ABC debate on September 10.\"\n\nThis announcement comes shortly after the 59-year-old Democratic nominee called out the 78-year-old politician at her campaign rally at Georgia State University, where she said, \"Well, Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider meeting me on the debate stage because, as the saying goes, 'If you've got something to say, say it to my face.'\"\n\nGiven that Kamala Harris has an extensive history in politics, from being elected attorney general of the state of California to serving as a courtroom prosecutor, she understands the type of opponent she faces in the 2024 presidential campaign. During one of her events, she voiced, \"In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type.\"\n\nTrump seemed to accept her challenge and mentioned during a conference in Florida, \"I think it's very important to have debates,\" and went on to share that they agreed on September 4 for FOX, September 10 for ABC, and September 25 for NBC. \"The other side has to agree to the terms. They may or may not agree. I don't know if they're going to agree. (Harris) hasn't done an interview... I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight,\" he added.\n\nOnce his confirmation came in, Kamala revealed that she was glad he agreed to the discussion. \"I'm glad that he's finally agreed to a debate on September 10th. I'm looking forward to it, and I hope he shows up,\" she told reporters.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_acosta@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "Jessica Acosta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2158908937_50754d-e1723212140513.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802917", "eventUri": "eng-9802917", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 405, "textEnd": 417, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 1433, "textEnd": 1444}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-25", "textStart": 1480, "textEnd": 1492}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Team Trump had originally agreed to participate in the event, but as of seven days ago, the GOP nominee and his political operation had changed their minds.\n\nIn fact, they presented a relatively detailed case explaining their decision to back away from the original commitment, citing Trump's ongoing litigation against ABC and network anchor George Stephanopoulos, which dovetailed with the former president's incessant whining -- online and in conservative media interviews -- about the network.\n\nTrump instead said he would only agree to debate on Fox News -- at a time of his choosing, in a location of his choosing, and with the kind of in-venue audience that makes him happy.\n\nAfter months of \"anywhere, anyplace\" chest-thumping when President Joe Biden was still running, the Republican posted an item to his social media platform that read, \"I'll see her on September 4th or, I won't see her at all.\"\n\nAnd then he blinked. The Associated Press reported:\n\nIn other words, over the course of a few months, Team Trump agreed to the ABC debate, then backed out of the ABC debate, then caved under pressure and re-agreed to the ABC debate.\n\nIn the process, the former president also expressed interest in two other debates -- not including a possible event for the vice presidential candidates -- though during his press conference he flubbed the dates while pointing to debates that haven't yet been negotiated and might not occur.\n\nAs for why, exactly, Trump spent weeks backing away from sharing a stage with Harris, only to have a sudden change of heart, I won't pretend to have any special insights into the former president's thinking, but it's hard not to notice the parallels between the GOP nominee's thinking this week and Biden's thinking months ago: The incumbent wanted to shake up the 2024 race, so he agreed to debate his rival.\n\nMonths later, it's Trump who suddenly feels the need to shake up the campaign, so he agreed to reverse course on debating his rival.\n\nThe Republican declared at his Mar-a-Lago press conference, \"I haven't recalibrated strategy at all.\" His debate strategy suggests otherwise.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lgc4VLUqcxro5WxBvSrfkw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/a890ddec6d126cd9de3db5b0163312e3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802917", "eventUri": "eng-9802917", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 128, "textEnd": 136}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 1044, "textEnd": 1057}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

"Harris blitzes battlegrounds as Trump schedule raises eyebrows", "body": "Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz greet supporters at a campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin\n\nDonald Trump was to campaign Friday in a safe Republican state as Kamala Harris barnstorms the battlegrounds likely to decide November's election, carried by surge in momentum that has left her opponent scrambling.\n\nWith election day just three months away, Trump's light schedule -- a rally every four or five days -- has been contrasted with the hectic program of an opponent almost 20 years his junior, and his with own vigorous campaigning in 2016.\n\nThe 78-year-old tycoon has held just five rallies since the Republican National Convention concluded in mid-July -- one fewer than Harris is staging this week alone -- and has no events at all announced yet for next week.\n\nEight years ago, Trump was staging multiple events a day by August, but the oldest major party presidential nominee in US history is venturing out of Florida for the first time this week for a rally in Montana, a state he should win easily.\n\nThe ex-president -- who survived an assassination attempt at a rally last month -- bristled at questions over his schedule in a hastily-convened press conference at his home in south Florida Thursday.\n\nHe said he had been absent from battleground states because he was \"leading by a lot and because I'm letting their convention go through,\" a reference to the Democratic National Convention, which doesn't end until August 22.\n\n- 'Low energy' -\n\nThe Harris campaign called the ex-president \"low energy\" --- a favorite Trump insult -- while his former communications chief Alyssa Farah Griffin bemoaned Republicans not picking a \"younger, more vibrant candidate.\"\n\nTrump appeared on track to win back the White House before Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, but Harris has made big gains since replacing the president at the top of the ticket and naming running mate Tim Walz.\n\nHer rise appears to have wrongfooted Trump, who dismissed her surging polling numbers as he held court in front of journalists at his Mar-a-Lago estate for a free-wheeling hour-plus news conference.\n\nHe complained about coverage of Harris's large crowds and assailed her for avoiding holding her own media availability.\n\nMore from this section D-Day hero gets over 200 letters to celebrate his 100th birthday US envoy skips Nagasaki memorial after Israel snub Before Yunus, dissidents who won the Peace Nobel and became leaders\n\nAnd in a bizarre moment that made headlines, he related an anecdote about a helicopter near-miss that never happened, in which he appeared to confuse former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown with former California governor Jerry Brown.\n\nHe pitched three September debates -- mixing up the dates of the showdowns he was proposing -- and attacked Harris as unintelligent and incompetent.\n\nFormer prosecutor Harris -- praised for her forensic questioning as a senator and for her performance in the vice-presidential debate in 2020 -- immediately confirmed one of the dates, an ABC face-off on September 10.\n\n- 'Unify and organize' -\n\nMeanwhile Harris continues her tour of the swing states alongside Walz, with a stop in the racially diverse Southwestern battlegrounds of Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Saturday.\n\nFormerly worried White House aides have begun to rekindle their enthusiasm over the possibility of victory in the two states, which were shifted this week from \"lean Republican\" to \"toss up\" by election forecaster Cook Political Report.\n\nThe first large survey of Latino voters with Harris as the presumptive nominee -- commissioned by voter engagement group Somos PAC -- showed Harris leading Trump by 18 points in the battleground states.\n\n\"The stakes of this election require Latinos to unify and organize together like our lives depend on it,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said, welcoming Harris's endorsement by the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nPolicy has taken a backseat in an election overwhelmed in recent weeks

(AP) -- Debby's final chapter involves moving north and northeast from the Carolinas at a faster clip with soaking rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes into the weekend. Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend. The South Carolina town of Moncks Corner was hit early Friday by flash flooding. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon and was a post-tropical cyclone on Friday.\n\nIran is accelerating cyber activity that appears meant to influence the US election, Microsoft says\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A new report from Microsoft finds that Iran is accelerating online activity that appears intended to influence the U.S. election. Friday's report finds that Iranian actors have recently created fake news sites, impersonated activists and in one case targeted a U.S. presidential campaign official with an email phishing attack. Microsoft says the activity shows how Iran is laying the groundwork to stoke division and potentially sway American voters this fall. U.S. intelligence officials say Russia continues to pose the greatest threat for election disinformation, while Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously. Iran's United Nations mission denied that it plans cyberattacks or other interference in the U.S. election.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nRussia declares an emergency in Kursk, under attack by Ukraine. 10 killed in Russian strike on mall\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia's Ministry for Emergencies has declared the situation in the Kursk region a \"federal level\" emergency and sent reinforcements. The announcement came four days after hundreds of Ukrainian troops poured over the border in what appeared to be Kyiv's biggest attack on Russian soil since the war began. Authorities in eastern Ukraine meanwhile said a Russian plane-launched missile hit a shopping mall late morning Friday, killing at least nine people and injuring 26. The mall is located in a town's residential area. Thick black smoke rose above it after the strike. Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said it was \"another act of terror by the Russians.\"\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nBoxer Imane Khelif fights for gold to cap an Olympics filled with misinformed scrutiny\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Imane Khelif is one victory away from wrapping up her tumultuous Paris Olympics with a gold medal around her neck after enduring waves of online abuse over misconceptions about her sex. Khelif fights Yang Liu of China in the final of the women's welterweight division. The vitriol against Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association disqualifying them from last year's world championships. The sport's governing body has been banned from the Olympics and claimed both fighters had failed murky eligibility tests for women's competition. The International Olympic Committee has called the arbitrary sex tests imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nIsraeli troops launch a new assault into Gaza's Khan Younis as mediators push for cease-fire talks\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israeli troops have launched a new assault into the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military says they're targeting Hamas fighters who they claim still operate there despite repeated offensives. American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have renewed their push for Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire deal. Israel said it would attend Aug. 15 talks called by the mediators. Evacuation orders triggered another exodus of Palestinians from eastern districts of Khan Younis. Israeli officials have said they believe Hamas' newly appointed top leader, Yahya Sinwar, could be hiding there.\n\nHearing in Karen Read case expected to focus on jury deliberations\n\nDEDHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the Karen Read case are set to return to court with the focus expected to be on jury deliberations that led to a mistrial on charges she killed her police officer boyfriend. Read is accused of ramming into John O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him for dead in a January 2022 snowstorm. The defense contends four jurors have said the jury unanimously reached a not guilty verdict on second-degree murder and leaving the scene of a deadly accident and were deadlocked on the remaining manslaughter charge. The hearing is scheduled for Friday afternoon.\n\n3rd person in custody over foiled plot targeting now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities have announced a third arrest in connection with the foiled conspiracy to attack three now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts even as disappointed fans charmed Vienna by trading friendship bracelets and singing the pop star's songs in the streets. The main suspect planned to target onlookers gathered outside Ernst Happel Stadium with knives or homemade explosives during the concert on Thursday or Friday. Authorities say the scheme was inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. Swift is set to travel to London's Wembley stadium for five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMatrix Advises

Eyebrows", "body": "Donald Trump was to campaign Friday in a safe Republican state as Kamala Harris barnstorms the battlegrounds likely to decide November's election, carried by surge in momentum that has left her opponent scrambling.\n\nWith election day just three months away, Trump's light schedule -- a rally every four or five days -- has been contrasted with the hectic program of an opponent almost 20 years his junior, and his with own vigorous campaigning in 2016.\n\nThe 78-year-old tycoon has held just five rallies since the Republican National Convention concluded in mid-July -- one fewer than Harris is staging this week alone -- and has no events at all announced yet for next week.\n\nEight years ago, Trump was staging multiple events a day by August, but the oldest major party presidential nominee in US history is venturing out of Florida for the first time this week for a rally in Montana, a state he should win easily.\n\nThe ex-president -- who survived an assassination attempt at a rally last month -- bristled at questions over his schedule in a hastily-convened press conference at his home in south Florida Thursday.\n\nHe said he had been absent from battleground states because he was \"leading by a lot and because I'm letting their convention go through,\" a reference to the Democratic National Convention, which doesn't end until August 22.\n\nThe Harris campaign called the ex-president \"low energy\" --- a favorite Trump insult -- while his former communications chief Alyssa Farah Griffin bemoaned Republicans not picking a \"younger, more vibrant candidate.\"\n\nTrump appeared on track to win back the White House before Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, but Harris has made big gains since replacing the president at the top of the ticket and naming running mate Tim Walz.\n\nHer rise appears to have wrongfooted Trump, who dismissed her surging polling numbers as he held court in front of journalists at his Mar-a-Lago estate for a free-wheeling hour-plus news conference.\n\nHe complained about coverage of Harris's large crowds and assailed her for avoiding holding her own media availability.\n\nAnd in a bizarre moment that made headlines, he related an anecdote about a helicopter near-miss that never happened, in which he appeared to confuse former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown with former California governor Jerry Brown.\n\nHe pitched three September debates -- mixing up the dates of the showdowns he was proposing -- and attacked Harris as unintelligent and incompetent.\n\nFormer prosecutor Harris -- praised for her forensic questioning as a senator and for her performance in the vice-presidential debate in 2020 -- immediately confirmed one of the dates, an ABC face-off on September 10.\n\nMeanwhile Harris continues her tour of the swing states alongside Walz, with a stop in the racially diverse Southwestern battlegrounds of Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Saturday.\n\nFormerly worried White House aides have begun to rekindle their enthusiasm over the possibility of victory in the two states, which were shifted this week from \"lean Republican\" to \"toss up\" by election forecaster Cook Political Report.\n\nThe first large survey of Latino voters with Harris as the presumptive nominee -- commissioned by voter engagement group Somos PAC -- showed Harris leading Trump by 18 points in the battleground states.\n\n\"The stakes of this election require Latinos to unify and organize together like our lives depend on it,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said, welcoming Harris's endorsement by the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nPolicy has taken a backseat in an election overwhelmed in recent weeks by Biden's disastrous debate performance, the assassination bid on Trump and Harris surge.\n\nBut Harris and Biden will discuss tackling inflation -- a top concern for voters and a winning issue for Trump -- in Maryland next week at their first joint campaign trip since the president's withdrawal.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She is, I think, she's worse than Biden,\" he said.\n\nThe former president's debate with a dismally performing Biden in June spelled the end of the veteran Democrat's reelection campaign, but Trump had been reluctant to face Harris on neutral territory.\n\nThe 78-year-old has been struggling to come up with effective attack lines to define Harris while delivering a series of increasingly confounding nicknames for his opponent.\n\nThe news conference was his first public appearance since Harris - a generation younger than Trump at 59 - announced running mate Tim Walz and embarked on a tour of closely fought election battlegrounds.\n\nShe and Walz appeared on Thursday in Michigan ahead of a trip to the racially diverse \"Sun Belt\" states of Arizona and Nevada for rallies on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down. It's based on who you lift up,\" she told a crowd of around 170 supporters in Detroit, at a much smaller event than her recent arena rallies.\n\nSabato's Crystal Ball, a leading election forecaster, shifted three of its ratings in favor of Democrats on Wednesday, moving Minnesota and New Hampshire from \"leans Democratic\" to \"likely Democratic\" and Georgia from \"leans Republican\" to \"toss-up.\"\n\nMeanwhile Marquette University Law School released a nationwide survey showing that, among likely voters, Harris now leads Trump by six points - 53 percent to 47 percent.\n\nDespite her intensive campaign schedule, Harris has taken almost no questions from reporters since entering the race and Trump had been seeking to turn her lack of media exposure into an election issue even before Thursday's news conference.\n\n\"She hasn't done an interview - she can't do an interview, she's barely competent. But I look forward to the debates, because I think we have to set the record straight,\" he said in Florida.\n\nHarris said later on Thursday: \"I've talked to my team.

I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month,\" she said as she was departing Detroit for Arizona, the New York Post reported.\n\nHarris has faced virtually no questions since assuming the Democratic mantle without running in a single primary; during his media briefing Thursday, Trump found himself in the odd position of defending President Joe Biden for being summarily deposed by Team Kamala and the Democrats, despite the fact he ran virtually unopposed in the primaries. (And usually ceded the most votes in those primaries not to any candidate, but to \"uncommitted.\")\n\n\"The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden,\" Trump said.\n\n\"And I'm no Biden fan, but I tell you what: From a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away ... whether he could win or couldn't win, he had the right to run, and they took it away.\"\n\nOf course, it goes somewhat without saying why Kamala Harris' people don't want more than one debate or any sort of interview. After all, when Biden bombed during the debate on June 27 and in subsequent interviews there was at least a plausible excuse why: He was old. The way to fix that? Install a younger candidate without having them go through the primary process.\n\nHarris is 59, not 81 -- so what's her excuse when, not if, these kind of moments re-arise when she gets spontaneous with the media and/or her opponent?\n\nShe may indeed be unburdened by the past, but it continues to inform the present, hence the fact why she's been dodging any sort of audience that doesn't verge upon sheer adulation of her and her running mate.\n\nHarris will have to run at least two gauntlets within the next month or so, if she's good for her word: At least one interview before Sept. 1, and a debate on Sept. 10. We'll see if Mrs. \"If You Have Something to Say, Say it to My Face\" wants more than that, or if even that's too much for her to bite off.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

Tim Walz conducted a series of triumphant campaign rallies around the U.S.\n\nMORE: It's Time We Have A Serious Talk About Donald Trump's Cognitive Decline\n\nThe press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, of course, was replete with lies and extreme exaggeration, including one that invoked Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s good name. But it also featured at least one notable instance of an obvious misunderstanding of the term \"asylum.\"\n\nWhile fearmongering about \"illegal aliens\" during an ill-informed rant about immigration, Trump asked why \"millions of people are allowed to come into our country from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions, insane asylums -- even from insane asylums.\"\n\nComparing the nation's southern border to \"a mental institution on steroids,\" Trump said without proof that those such \"institutions\" were \"being emptied out ... all over the world,\" implying their occupants were illegally entering the U.S.\n\nWatch below.\n\nHowever, a closer listen reveals that Trump is misusing the word \"asylum\" to only refer to institutions specializing in mental health, while ignoring the legal path of undocumented immigrants seeking asylum at the border.\n\nThose are two very different concepts, both of which it is assumed that presidential candidates should have a firm understanding. But you know what they say about people who assume.\n\nThursday wasn't the first time Trump has said this, either.\n\nTrump has also said that people crossing the border are bringing \"very contagious diseases\" with them despite the absence of any proof of that claim.\n\nMeanwhile, during the same press conference, Trump -- possibly suffering from an incurable case of size envy -- said with a straight face that his rallies command a larger presence than Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic \"I Have A Dream\" speech around the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat is nothing to speak of how Trump has reversed his stance on how Walz handled the George Floyd protests in and around Minnesota in the wake of the horrific police murder in 2020.\n\nThat was when Trump praised Walz's response to the uprisings as being \"incredible. They went in and dominated, and it happened immediately.\"\n\nBut just months ago in May, Trump gave himself credit for the response, not Walz.\n\n\"The entire city was burning down. ... If you didn't have me as president, you wouldn't have Minneapolis today,\" Trump told people attending a fundraiser.\n\nWhen you add the above instances that came during the same speech alongside all the previous instances of apparent mental decline -- and counting -- the evidence of Trump experiencing cognitive problems has been long mounting.\n\nHarris' candidacy seemingly put Trump's campaign into a tailspin from which it has yet to fully recover.\n\nA growing number of polls give the edge to Harris over Trump in a reversal of circumstances from before Biden dropped out.\n\nThis is America.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nLying Weirdo J.D.

Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend. The South Carolina town of Moncks Corner was hit early Friday by flash flooding. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday.

Friday's report finds that Iranian actors have recently created fake news sites, impersonated activists and in one case targeted a U.S. presidential campaign official with an email phishing attack. Microsoft says the activity shows how Iran is laying the groundwork to stoke division and potentially sway American voters this fall. U.S. intelligence officials say Russia continues to pose the greatest threat for election disinformation, while Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously. Iran's United Nations mission denied that it plans cyberattacks or other interference in the U.S. election.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states.

That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nRussia declares an emergency in Kursk, under attack by Ukraine. 10 killed in Russian strike on mall\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia's Ministry for Emergencies has declared the situation in the Kursk region a \"federal level\" emergency and sent reinforcements. The announcement came four days after hundreds of Ukrainian troops poured over the border in what appeared to be Kyiv's biggest attack on Russian soil since the war began. Authorities in eastern Ukraine meanwhile said a Russian plane-launched missile hit a shopping mall late morning Friday, killing at least nine people and injuring 26. The mall is located in a town's residential area. Thick black smoke rose above it after the strike. Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said it was \"another act of terror by the Russians.\"\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nBoxer Imane Khelif fights for gold to cap an Olympics filled with misinformed scrutiny\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Imane Khelif is one victory away from wrapping up her tumultuous Paris Olympics with a gold medal around her neck after enduring waves of online abuse over misconceptions about her sex. Khelif fights Yang Liu of China in the final of the women's welterweight division. The vitriol against Khelif and fellow two-time Olympian Li Yu-ting of Taiwan stems from the Russian-dominated International Boxing Association disqualifying them from last year's world championships. The sport's governing body has been banned from the Olympics and claimed both fighters had failed murky eligibility tests for women's competition. The International Olympic Committee has called the arbitrary sex tests imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nIsraeli troops launch a new assault into Gaza's Khan Younis as mediators push for cease-fire talks\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israeli troops have launched a new assault into the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The military says they're targeting Hamas fighters who they claim still operate there despite repeated offensives. American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have renewed their push for Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire deal. Israel said it would attend Aug. 15 talks called by the mediators. Evacuation orders triggered another exodus of Palestinians from eastern districts of Khan Younis. Israeli officials have said they believe Hamas' newly appointed top leader, Yahya Sinwar, could be hiding there.\n\nHearing in Karen Read case expected to focus on jury deliberations\n\nDEDHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the Karen Read case are set to return to court with the focus expected to be on jury deliberations that led to a mistrial on charges she killed her police officer boyfriend. Read is accused of ramming into John O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him for dead in a January 2022 snowstorm. The defense contends four jurors have said the jury unanimously reached a not guilty verdict on second-degree murder and leaving the scene of a deadly accident and were deadlocked on the remaining manslaughter charge. The hearing is scheduled for Friday afternoon.\n\n3rd person in custody over foiled plot targeting now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Austrian authorities have announced a third arrest in connection with the foiled conspiracy to attack three now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts even as disappointed fans charmed Vienna by trading friendship bracelets and singing the pop star's songs in the streets. The main suspect planned to target onlookers gathered outside Ernst Happel Stadium with knives or homemade explosives during the concert on Thursday or Friday. Authorities say the scheme was inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. Swift is set to travel to London's Wembley stadium for five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.\n\nMore from this section\n\nCrew of Titan sub

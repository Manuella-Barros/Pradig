In the NBA, tackle Game 2 of Cavaliers-Celtics and Mavericks-Thunder. Jayson Tatum and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will attempt to lead Boston and Oklahoma City to 2-0 series leads. Both teams are significant favorites on ESPN BET, with Boston's line up to 13.5 points.\n\nOn the ice, tonight's doubleheader includes Rangers-Hurricanes and Avalanche-Stars. New York won a double overtime thriller in Game 2 to take a 2-0 series lead, while Colorado overcame a 0-3 deficit in Game 1 to win 4-3 in overtime. However, ESPN BET has the Rangers (+145 moneyline) and Avalanche (+110) as slight road underdogs tonight.\n\nEnter ESPN BET Promo Code NOLA for $1K Bet Reset\n\nFollow our guide below to land ESPN BET's much-needed security for a $1,000 wager:\n\nOpen ESPN BET here and click the \"Sign Up\" button.Set up your account and confirm your identity.Enter our ESPN BET promo code NOLA when prompted.ESPN BET requires the code before activating the offer.Select online banking, credit/debit card, or another secure payment method.Make a $10+ cash deposit.Place up to $1,000 on the NBA, NHL, or another suitable betting market.Receive your stake back in bonus bets if you don't win.\n\nBonus bets arrive in five (5) 20% increments.

If you place a pre-live cash wager on an NHL moneyline and your team loses after multiple overtimes, ESPN BET will pay your stake back in bonus bets (max. $100).\n\nA great example of Double OT Protection at work is when the Hurricanes lost Game 2 to the Rangers after 90+ minutes of game time.

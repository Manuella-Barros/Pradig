(Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via AP)\n\nCollapsed Cyprus unity talks won't be revived, Turkey's European Union Minister Omer Celik said, declaring they were \"not suspended, nor frozen,\" but \"over\" and done.\n\nThe negotiations between Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish-Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci fell apart at the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana in July when Turkey said its' 35,000-strong army in the northern third occupied since an unlawful 1974 invasion would never be removed, nor would its declared right to militarily intervene again when it wanted.\n\nAccording to the Anadolu news agency, he made his statement following a meeting with the United Kingdom's Minister of State for Europe, Sir Alan Duncan, in Turkey. The UK, along with Greece and Turkey, is a guarantor of security on the divided island.\n\nCelik said only Turkey had a positive attitude in the Swiss talks but that it wasn't enough to reach a deal despite reports Anastasiades had agreed to go along with letting Cyprus be ruled by a Turkish President every other term and other concessions.\n\nDuncan, who had also attended the talks in Crans-Montana, was reportedly unhappy at the news but praised Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu for a \"constructive and positive approach,\" diplomatic boilerplate signifying nothing.\n\nCavusoglu said the demand by Anastasiades and Cypriots for Turkey to remove its army was an excuse and said that it was the Cypriot side that really didn't want a unity deal.\n\nHe also said they didn't want to share power - despite reportedly agreeing to do so through a Turkish-Cypriot President. His comments were reported by the Bayrak TV station in the occupied north..\n\nHe also told Turkish state broadcaster TRT that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots had done their part by presenting proposals he said were rational and constructive although he wouldn't say what they were as the talks were secret, depriving people on both sides of the island from knowing how their future was being decided.\n\n\"We wanted to discuss and conclude the last two chapters, especially territory and also security and guarantees together,\" Cavusoglu said, adding that the Greek Cypriots \"think that they are an EU member-state and, therefore, they do not want to share governance and power.\"\n\nHe added that Nicosia's \"unilateral drilling activities in Cyprus\" were wrong, referring to international companies seaching for oil and gas off the coast as Turkey has also sent a research vessels in Cypriot waters on a hunt as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who refuses to recognize Cyprus, a member of the EU he wants to join, and bars its ships and planes - demanded a share in any potential lucrative findings.\n\n\"Turkish-Cypriot people also have rights there,\"

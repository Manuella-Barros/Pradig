The report rated the precautionary measures in the hospital\u2019s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at just 29 per cent. The report said the deaths of the seven babies were \u201cpossibly related to the increase in cases of sepsis,\u201d referring to bacterial infections. Based on available information, while admitting to a low sample size, the report blamed an increase in NICU mortality of newborns or neonates. \u201cRegarding the variables gestational age and birth weight, both show the vulnerability and clinical complexity of the neonates. \u201cOf note, 17 out of 20 (85 per cent) fatal neonates were very or extremely pre-term and had extremely low or very low weight at birth.\u201d Extremely pre-term meant less than 28 weeks of gestation and very pre-term meant 28-31 weeks of gestation. Full-term babies are born at 40 weeks. Extremely low birth weight meant under 1,000 grammes (2.2 pounds) and very low birth weight meant less than 1,500 grammes (3.3 pounds). The report listed five aspects of infection prevention control (IPC) at PoSGH which were respectively rated at 29-80 per cent. Among these, neonatology was rated lowest, at 29 per cent. The PAHO recommendations included breast-feeding within 24 hours of birth, better hand hygiene, active screening of bacteria cultures during outbreaks, better nurse-patient ratios, policies and procedures for cleaning and for high-level disinfection and external performance evaluation of the laboratory. Deyalsingh told the House, \u201cI once again take this opportunity to extend my deepest condolences to the affected families.\u201d He quoted the report\u2019s executive summary: \u201cA significant strength identified in PoSGH is the presence of a dedicated IPC programme and a knowledgeable microbiology laboratory team capable of identifying pathogens. The commitment from both hospital administration and national authorities to enhance IPC measures was clearly evident and commendable.\u201d He said the report said TT\u2019s National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance for 2023-2027 aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan. \u201cThe Ministry of Health and the North West Regional Health Authority (the RHA under whose aegis the hospital falls) having gone through the report, inclusive of the findings and recommendations, note that many of the recommendations contained within the report were already integral parts of the national and regional standard operating procedure. \u201cWe are of the view, however, that there are certain findings that require urgent clarification.\u201d Deyalsingh said since getting the report on June 21, his ministry had actively communicated and collaborated with PAHO via its country office. \u201cThis is to ensure that PAHO has the opportunity to address and resolve these concerns promptly as the report anticipates the submission of additional data and information.\u201d He thanked PAHO and again offered his personal condolences and those of the Government to the affected families. PAHO: Faults and fixes at PoSGH NICU The report noted 12 shortcomings at the PoSGH NICU. It lamented an inadequate ratio of nursing professionals to patients. \u201cEarly breast milk feeds are not being instituted,\u201d the report added. Breast milk is known to help babies\u2019 immune systems fight infections. The report said policies and procedures for using multidose medications at the NICU must be developed. \u201cNICU unit dose medications are not prepared in sterile conditions by pharmacy. \u201cRecommendation: Sterile unit dose preparation of all NICU medications by pharmacy must be done.\u201d PAHO said there were no polices nor procedures for high-level disinfection for equipment such as laryngoscopes, but recommended those be developed. The report noted \u201climited hands-free alcohol-based hand-rub dispensers in NICU.\u201d More dispensers must be installed, PAHO recommended. The report lamented a \u201clack of implementation of timely contact precautions for patients affected by multi-drug-resistant organisms.\u201d Such precautions must be promptly instituted, PAHO said. There were \u201cbreaches in personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols observed in the NICU, indicating a need for improved compliance monitoring and training. \u201cRecommendation: Compliance monitoring of donning and doffing procedures for PPE and contact precautions on NICU using the WHO (World Health Organization) tool should be done.\u201d The report warned the use of multi-dose saline vials was observed and could lead to an increased risk of infections among patients. \u201cRecommendation: Use of single-dose saline vials only must be done.\u201d PAHO said infections at surgical and procedural sites were linked to inconsistent or inadequate skin-preparation practices. \u201cRecommendation: Use of pre-packaged two per cent Chlorhexidine skin preparation for preoperative skin prep, NICU procedures, and for caesarean sections must be done.\u201d However, the report also said skin irritation and adverse reactions were often seen in babies after the use of Chlorhexidine baths. PAHO recommended, \u201cUse individual pH neutral/mildly acidic gentle cleansers for neonates, discontinue Chlorhexidine baths.\u201d Lastly, the report said the preparation, storage and use of agents for skin prep prior to procedures was done in the pharmacy under unsatisfactory circumstances. The report noted ineffective practices, urging: \u201cCessation of shaving of surgical sites.\u201d", "summary": "<p><img width=\"825\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/23239234-e1719629133794-825x510.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" /></p>\n<p>THE deaths of several babies at Port of Spain General Hospital (PoSGH) in April was linked to poor infection prevention and control, said the PAHO report that Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh laid in the House of Representatives on Friday.</p>\n<p>The report rated the precautionary measures in the hospital\u2019s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at just 29 per cent.</p>\n<p>The report said the deaths of the seven babies were \u201cpossibly related to the increase in cases of sepsis,\u201d referring to bacterial infections.</p>\n<p>Based on available information, while admitting to a low sample size, the report blamed an increase in NICU mortality of newborns or neonates.</p>\n<p>\u201cRegarding the variables gestational age and birth weight, both show the vulnerability and clinical co", "url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2024/06/28/report-on-babies-deaths-at-posgh-made-public-paho-poor-care-for-newborns/", "image": "https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/23239234-e1719629133794.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:32:24", "author": "Sean Douglas", "authors": ["Sean Douglas"], "language": "en", "catgory": "science", "source_country": "tt", "sentiment": -0.132}

The 24-year-old moved to Old Trafford from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 in a \u00a373m deal with enormous expectations on his shoulders, but they have not been fulfilled. After a couple of underwhelming seasons, Sancho fell out with manager Erik ten Hag and was sent back to Dortmund on loan for the second half of this season. It was a positive move for him, playing regularly as Dortmund reached the Champions League final, narrowly losing out to Real Madrid at Wembley. Sancho didn\u2019t do enough to earn a recall to the England squad for this summer\u2019s European Championship, but his career appears to be back on an upward trajectory after a nightmare spell frozen out at Manchester United. However, the Red Devils have not been convinced that he should be welcomed back for another chance at Old Trafford and want to seal a permanent exit for him. The BBC report that Manchester United want \u00a340m for the winger and would much rather a permanent transfer than another loan deal, with Dortmund preferring another short-term switch. Erik ten Hag\u2019s public spat with Sancho sealed the winger\u2019s fate (Picture: Getty Images) Ten Hag\u2019s future remains unclear, with Manchester United reportedly still considering other options, although a decision is expected to be made on the coming days. Whether the Dutchman remains in charge or not, Sancho will be on the transfer list as the club tries to bring in funds to be used on new signings. Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl said last month that the club will do what they can to bring Sancho back next season, but that it may not be possible. \u2018His qualities don\u2019t need to be described,\u2019 Kehl told German publication Welt. \u2018He has regained his smile in the six months with us. \u2018We will try everything to keep Jadon Sancho here. But Manchester United also sees how well he is playing at the moment,\u2019 he added. \u2018Maybe they also want to sell him for profit or bring him back. We will see.\u2019 For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

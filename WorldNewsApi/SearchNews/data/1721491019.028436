Meet the glamour model and former Page 3 girl as couple welcome their...", "text": "Joe Wicks and his wife Rosie welcomed their fourth child on Monday, revealing they had a new baby boy. The Body Coach star, 38, and his beloved wife, 33, announced the joyful news on Instagram alongside a few gorgeous snaps of the newborn. The couple, who are also parents to daughters Indie, six, Leni, two, and son Marley, five, were completely over the moon to welcome another addition to their family. Captioning the joint post, Joe wrote: 'Today at 9.30am we welcomed our 4th baby into the world. A little boy weighing 7lbs 13oz. 'Rosie gave birth at home. The NHS midwives from St Peter's hospital were amazing. Rosie and the baby are both doing well and getting some rest.' Joe and Rosie have been together since 2016, with the fitness star revealing he had fallen for her before they even met. Rosie is a glamour model and former Page 3 girl, who began modelling at the age of 17 after joining Samantha Bond Management. The pair's relationship was discovered after they both shared a series of identical holiday pictures from Richard Branson's Necker Island. Joe revealed they had first met at a rave that he had intended for the sole reason of hoping to bump into her. He explained he had fallen head over heels for Rosie after seeing her on the cover of lads' mags, calling her his 'dream girl'. He told The Sun: 'Obviously, I bought newspapers and used to work on a building site. So I\u2019d observed her for seven or eight years in The Sun, Nuts and Zoo. I always thought she was so hot. Literally my dream girl. 'So, when my friend was DJing at this rave and I knew she was going to be there, I really wanted to meet her\u2026 I was just hoping she was a nice person as well.' Joe said that upon meeting he realised that Rosie was 'just as beautiful in person' and their romance blossomed rapidly. He explained: 'We formed a close friendship first, then became boyfriend and girlfriend, and from there, we just went crazy fast. I was madly in love and couldn\u2019t be apart from her. 'It was perfect timing. I\u2019d started to have a bit of success \u2013 I actually met her the day before my first book came out, so she\u2019s been with me from the beginning. 'I was 30, she wanted someone who was committed and I knew early on that I wanted to spend my life with her. Some people play games, but I can\u2019t do that. We were both very upfront about how we felt and that meant we didn\u2019t p**s around.' The couple announced their engagement in November 2018, four months after welcoming their first child, Indie. They then tied the knot on June 29, 2019, less than a year after getting engaged, in stunning countryside ceremony. They were joined by their close friends and family, including some famous faces, such as Manchester United footballer Chris Smalling. The couple also hosted a lavish carnival-themed reception with a Ferris wheel and merry-go-round, as well as food trucks, a gin bar and a Prosecco bike. Joe took to his Instagram to share a sweet post about their big day, gushing: 'It\u2019s true when people say your wedding day goes by in a flash. We had the best day ever with our close family and friends.' 'The venue was perfect, we were blessed with sunshine. We had fun fair rides, food trucks with our dream menu, A G&T bar and had gelato and frozen daqs for the win.' 'The DJ was absolutely lit too. He kept the dance floor packed until 1am. Wish I could do it all over again.' Joe and Rosie went on to welcome Marley and Leni, before announcing they were expecting another child in January, when Rosie was already 20 weeks pregnant. They decided to keep the gender of their baby a surprise and were still undecided on what to name the tot, just days before she gave birth. But the couple have already spoken about their desire to welcome more children together, with Joe admitting their ideal number was six. Speaking previously to The Sun, he revealed: 'I\u2019d love more kids. Rosie does too, just for the record! It\u2019s not just me saying: \"Come on, let\u2019s have more!\" 'She loves being a mum and is so maternal and so nurturing, which I think is such a lovely gift. Being a parent is stressful, but Rosie manages to stay calm all the time. 'I don\u2019t have as much patience \u2013 my house growing up was much more shouty and intolerant. I\u2019ve learned so much just from watching Rosie.' He also has said that they refuse to hire a nanny and instead enlists their motheres to help out with childcare. Speaking previously to OK! Online, Joe said: 'I'm so lucky as my mum and Rosie's mum are nearby. I'd find it hard to leave my kids with someone I didn't know, so the fact I've got my mum means I can have a night out in a hotel and I love that.", "summary": "The Body Coach star, 38, and his beloved wife, 33, announced the joyful news on Instagram alongside a few gorgeous snaps of the newborn.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13539767/Joe-Wicks-wife-Rosie-glamour-model-Page-3-girl-fourth-child.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/21/86235237-0-image-m-27_1718654821741.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/04/28/8520408294092027296/1024x576_MP4_8520408294092027296.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:11:08", "author": "Editor,Milly Veitch", "authors": ["Editor", "Milly Veitch"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.127}

The decision was upheld in 2022.\n\nThe appellate court said the SEC \"acted with grave abuse of discretion\" in revoking Rappler's certificate of incorporation.\n\nRappler had previously argued the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic arm of EBay founder Pierre Omidyar, was a silent investor. Omidyar cut ties by donating the depository receipts to Rappler's staff.\n\nRappler was founded by Ressa, won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize along with Russian investigative journalist Dmitry Muratov in a decision widely seen as an endorsement of free speech rights that had come under fire worldwide.\n\nRessa is currently on bail after being convicted in 2020 in a cyber libel case.

The court deemed the SEC's actions as abusive and voided their previous orders.\n\nA Philippine court has ordered the country's corporate regulator to restore the license of Rappler, a media firm led by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa who reported on former President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in a decision dated July 23 that was seen by Reuters on Friday, had voided orders and decisions of the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to shut down the online news site. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe SEC in 2018 rescinded the operating licence of Rappler for violating foreign equity restrictions on domestic media when it sold depositary rights to a foreign entity. The decision was upheld in 2022. The appellate court said the SEC \"acted with grave abuse of discretion\" in revoking Rappler's certificate of incorporation.\n\nRappler had previously argued the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic arm of EBay founder Pierre Omidyar, was a silent investor. Omidyar cut ties by donating the depository receipts to Rappler's staff. Rappler was founded by Ressa, won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize along with Russian investigative journalist Dmitry Muratov in a decision widely seen as an endorsement of free speech rights that had come under fire worldwide.\n\nRessa is currently on bail after being convicted in 2020 in a cyber libel case.

Charges have included tax evasion, violation of foreign ownership rules, and cyber libel.\n\nRappler had angered Mr. Duterte with its investigation into his brutal drug war. Ms. Ressa told The Times in 2022 that she viewed the cases against her and Rappler as \"harassment and intimidation.\"\n\nThe latest decision involved the biggest case facing Rappler, connected to the revocation of its operating license in 2018. That revocation had been ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said that an investment by Omidyar Network, owned by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, violated the restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic media.

The government alleged that the funding gave Omidyar some control over Rappler.\n\nRappler denied Omidyar wielded any control over it through the financial receipts, which Omidyar later donated to the online outfit's employees.\n\nThe court ruled that the 2018 shutdown order, one of several legal issues that Ressa and Rappler faced under Duterte, was made \"with grave abuse of discretion, contravening established procedures, jurisprudential and legal instructions, and clear intent of the constitution.\"\n\nDuterte and other Philippine officials have said the criminal complaints against Ressa and Rappler, which included tax lawsuits, were not a press freedom issue but part of normal judicial procedures.\n\nBut Duterte was known for openly lambasting journalists and news agencies that critically reported about his deadly campaign against illegal drugs, including the country's largest TV network, ABS-CNS. ABS-CNS was shut down in 2020 after Duterte-allied lawmakers refused to renew its license.\n\nThe Philippines has long been regarded as one of the most dangerous places for journalists in the world.\n\nIn 2009, members of a powerful political clan and their associates gunned down 58 people, including 32 media workers, in a brazen attack in southern Maguindanao province. It was the deadliest single attack on journalists in recent history.\n\nWhile the mass killing was later linked to a violent electoral rivalry, it also showcased the threats faced by journalists in the Philippines. A surfeit of unlicensed guns and private armies controlled by powerful clans, and a lack of law enforcement in rural areas are among the security concerns journalists face in the poverty-stricken Southeast Asian nation.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rappler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Omidyar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Omidyar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Ressa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maria Ressa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omidyar_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omidyar Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_drug_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippine drug war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maguindanao"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maguindanao"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "summary_large_image", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803473", "eventUri": "eng-9803473", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 570, "textEnd": 577}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Charges have included tax evasion, violation of foreign ownership rules, and cyber libel.\n\nRappler had angered Mr. Duterte with its investigation into his brutal drug war. Ms. Ressa told The Times in 2022 that she viewed the cases against her and Rappler as \"harassment and intimidation.\"\n\nThe latest decision involved the biggest case facing Rappler, connected to the revocation of its operating license in 2018. That revocation had been ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said that an investment by Omidyar Network, owned by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, violated the restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic media. (The Constitution prohibits foreign entities from owning domestic media organizations in the Philippines.)\n\nRappler continued to operate pending the final outcome of the case, but the order added to the challenges it faced.\n\nIn 2020, the S.E.C. upheld its earlier order. Rappler argued then that Omidyar Network's investment was not the same as owning shares, did not give the company control of its operations, and did not violate the law. Rappler vowed to take the case to the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Philippine Court of Appeals, in a ruling dated July 23 but made public on Friday, said that \"the facts show that Rappler Holdings, and by extension Rappler, are currently wholly owned and managed by Filipinos.\"\n\nAccording to the full text of the judgment, the court added that the S.E.C. had \"plowed through law and jurisprudence to reach its mark -- the death of Rappler.\"\n\n\"These actions have no place in a democratic state,\" it said.\n\nThe S.E.C. took action against Rappler after Mr. Duterte singled out the news organization in his 2017 State of the Nation speech. He said it was \"fully owned\" by Americans, a claim that Rappler has denied.\n\nMs. Ressa was visibly emotional when she spoke to reporters on Friday.\n\n\"What is clear through all of this is that there are good people in our judiciary, there are good people in government, and we have banked on that, like, literally, we had to have faith,\" she said.\n\nShe said that because of the S.E.C. ruling, banks refused to do business with Rappler, clients shied away from advertising with the company, and it had to shut down its bureau in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.\n\nMs. Ressa's legal troubles have eased considerably under the current president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nBut press freedom continues to be mixed. Unlike Mr. Duterte, Mr. Marcos does not blatantly attack the mainstream media. But he also gives few interviews, and the Philippines continues to be one of the most dangerous countries for journalists.\n\nMs. Ressa and Rappler's board members still await the resolution of two other cases, including her appeal of a June 2020 conviction on a cyber libel charge that could send her to prison for six years.\n\nOn the current state of press freedom in the Philippines, Ms. Ressa said: \"It's like we were in hell.

The government alleged that the funding gave Omidyar some control over Rappler.\n\nRappler denied Omidyar wielded any control over it through the financial receipts, which Omidyar later donated to the online outfit's employees.\n\nThe court ruled that the 2018 shutdown order, one of several legal issues that Ressa and Rappler faced under Duterte, was made \"with grave abuse of discretion, contravening established procedures, jurisprudential and legal instructions, and clear intent of the constitution.\"\n\nDuterte and other Philippine officials have said the criminal complaints against Ressa and Rappler, which included tax lawsuits, were not a press freedom issue but part of normal judicial procedures.\n\nBut Duterte was known for openly lambasting journalists and news agencies that critically reported about his deadly campaign against illegal drugs, including the country's largest TV network, ABS-CNS. ABS-CNS was shut down in 2020 after Duterte-allied lawmakers refused to renew its license.\n\nThe Philippines has long been regarded as one of the most dangerous places for journalists in the world.\n\nIn 2009, members of a powerful political clan and their associates gunned down 58 people, including 32 media workers, in a brazen attack in southern Maguindanao province. It was the deadliest single attack on journalists in recent history.\n\nWhile the mass killing was later linked to a violent electoral rivalry, it also showcased the threats faced by journalists in the Philippines. A surfeit of unlicensed guns and private armies controlled by powerful clans, and a lack of law enforcement in rural areas are among the security concerns journalists face in the poverty-stricken Southeast Asian nation.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The government alleged that the funding gave Omidyar some control over Rappler.\n\nRappler denied Omidyar wielded any control over it through the financial receipts, which Omidyar later donated to the online outfit's employees.\n\nThe court ruled that the 2018 shutdown order, one of several legal issues that Ressa and Rappler faced under Duterte, was made \"with grave abuse of discretion, contravening established procedures, jurisprudential and legal instructions, and clear intent of the constitution.\"\n\nDuterte and other Philippine officials have said the criminal complaints against Ressa and Rappler, which included tax lawsuits, were not a press freedom issue but part of normal judicial procedures.\n\nBut Duterte was known for openly lambasting journalists and news agencies that critically reported about his deadly campaign against illegal drugs, including the country's largest TV network, ABS-CNS. ABS-CNS was shut down in 2020 after Duterte-allied lawmakers refused to renew its license.\n\nThe Philippines has long been regarded as one of the most dangerous places for journalists in the world.\n\nIn 2009, members of a powerful political clan and their associates gunned down 58 people, including 32 media workers, in a brazen attack in southern Maguindanao province. It was the deadliest single attack on journalists in recent history.\n\nWhile the mass killing was later linked to a violent electoral rivalry, it also showcased the threats faced by journalists in the Philippines. A surfeit of unlicensed guns and private armies controlled by powerful clans, and a lack of law enforcement in rural areas are among the security concerns journalists face in the poverty-stricken Southeast Asian nation.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@abcnews.go.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rappler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Omidyar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Omidyar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Ressa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria Ressa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omidyar_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omidyar Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_drug_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippine drug war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maguindanao"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maguindanao"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c895a177-0e44-4a32-b6f4-3917795a6da3/wirestory_2ff14f292a9465beaf2606e470b5a3f8_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803473", "eventUri": "eng-9803473", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 818, "textEnd": 825}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The Philippine government has revoked the operating licence of leading news website Rappler, officials said Jan. 15, 2018 in a ruling denounced by President Rodrigo Duterte's critics as another blow to press freedom.\n\nAFP / Ted Aljibe. file\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- The Court of Appeals has ordered to restore the certificate of incorporation of the company that runs news website Rappler and its owner, Rappler Holdings Corp., voiding a 2022 ruling by the Securities and Exchange Commission that declared the company was not 100% Filipino-owned.\n\n\"The Securities and Exchange Commission is ordered to restore the Certificate of Incorporation of Rappler, Inc. and Rappler Holdings Corporation in its records and system and withdraw all its issuances and actions made pursuant to its illegal revocation of the same,\" said the Court of Appeals Special 7th Division in a 48-page decision promulgated on July 23.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Rappler said the appeals court's decision was a \"vindication after a tortuous eight years of harassment.\"\n\n\"Rappler welcomes the Court of Appeals (CA) ruling that eliminates a long-standing threat to its corporate existence on account of a flawed ruling by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). When the rule of law prevails, justice is served,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The CA was unequivocal in its rejection of the SEC's 2018 shutdown order, declaring it 'illegal' and a 'grave abuse of discretion,'\" the news organization added.\n\nWhat went before\n\nIn 2018, the regulatory commission ordered to shut down Rappler for violating the constitutional prohibitions for mass media when it issued Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs) that gave Omidyar Network, a foreign entity, control over the media organization.\n\nThat same year, the Court of Appeals upheld the regulatory commision's decision that the media organization allegedly violated the Constitution and foreign equity restrictions in mass media.\n\nHowever, the court also asked the regulatory commission to evaluate the legal effect of the alleged donation of Omidyar Network of all its PDRs to Rappler staff.\n\nIn 2022, the regulatory commission ruled that Omidyar's donation of PDRs \"did not cure the violation by Rappler Inc. and Rappler Holdings Corporation\" and upheld its revokation of Rappler's certificates.\n\nGrave abuse of discretion\n\nOn July 23, the appeals court ruled that the regulatory commission had committed grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that the donated PDRs did not waive Rappler's alleged violation without actually studying the terms and conditions of the donation.\n\nThe decision noted that the regulatory commission did not conduct any hearing or receive any evidence from petitioners prior to making its ruling.\n\n\"Thus, it has no knowledge whatsoever of the terms of the donation, nor has it even reviewed the donation itself,\" it added.\n\nThe regulatory commission \"chose to ignore\" the appeals court's order and \"'evaluated' the legal effect of Omidyar's donation without even bothering to look at the donation itself,\" the decision said.\n\n\"Worse, it actively avoided giving petitioners the opportunity to present the same. Such action is the height of grave abuse of discretion,\" it added.\n\nThe regulatory commission also \"intentionally shirked its responsibility, ignoring the directive of the CA 12th Division to 'evaluate the terms and conditions of the alleged supervening donation.'\"\n\n\"On this basis alone, the assailed Compliance and Order should be reversed and set aside,\" the decision said.\n\nOn the PDRs. The appeals court also ruled that the PDRs by Omidyar did not amount to a constitutional violation.\n\n\"As law and jurisprudence stand, there is nothing prohibiting Filipinos from entering into PDR agreements, even if the underlying shares are mandated to be Filipino-owned,\" the decision read.\n\n\"The only limitation, pursuant to the above-cited cases, is to issue shares of stock which are lacking in voting rights, the right to dispose or the right to receive dividends. Here, Rappler Holdings retained all these rights,\" it added.\n\nThe facts point to Rappler being \"currently wholly owned and managed by Filipinos, in compliance with the Constitutional mandate,\" the decision said.\n\nThe news site considers the decision to be its \"biggest case as a company,\" according to its report on the decision on Friday.\n\n'Harassment'\n\nThe 2018 ruling by the regulatory commission turned out to be the first in a slew of cases filed against Rappler, which one of several prominent news organizations that earned the ire of the Duterte administration from 2016 to 2022.\n\nFormer President Rodrigo Duterte routinely vilified the media in public speeches during his six-year term. He once publicly blasted Rappler as a \"fake news outlet\" for reporting on a multibillion-peso Navy frigate acquisition project, ushered in the closure of ABS-CBN, the nation's largest broadcaster, and issued threats against the Philippine Daily Inquirer.\n\nRappler said it was a \"fact that the Duterte government used the SEC order to unleash its power to further harass us, our employees, our stakeholders, and our communities.\"\n\n\"Banks refused to do business with us. Clients shied away from advertising with us. Government officials and agencies shut their doors on us. We were forced to close our Jakarta bureau, stop our expansion plans. Rappler couldn't even open a bank account outside the Philippines,\" the company said in its statement.\n\n\"We look forward to the speedy dismissal of our remaining two cases: the cyber libel case at the Supreme Court and the anti-dummy case at a Pasig court,\" they added.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The ruling marks a significant victory for free speech in the country, underscoring the judicial system's check on regulatory overreach.\n\nPhilippine Nobel laureate Maria Ressa's news website, Rappler, has triumphed in its appeal to restore its corporate licence. In a decision dated July 23 but made public on Friday, the Court of Appeals overturned the 2018 shutdown order issued by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ruling that the regulator had overstepped its authority.\n\nAccording to the court's ruling, the SEC had unjustly pursued the closure of Rappler. \"Like a bull seeing red, the SEC... plowed through law and jurisprudence to reach its mark - the death of Rappler,\" the court document stated. The SEC has so far refrained from commenting, indicating that it has yet to receive the decision's copy.\n\nThe SEC had originally rescinded Rappler's operating licence for violating foreign equity restrictions in 2018 when the media company sold depositary rights to a U.S.-based entity. Despite this, Rappler continued its operations pending the appeal process.

A month after, Omidyar donated the PDRs to Rappler's Filipino managers, which led the CA in the same year to ask the SEC to reevaluate its decision, believing the donation had removed the problem. Instead, the SEC upheld its order just before former president Rodrigo Duterte stepped down from the presidency in 2022. As all of this was happening, Rappler was battling the SEC in the CA and was at risk of being shut down.\n\nAccording to the CA's latest decision, Rappler was being \"accorded preferential treatment - a negative one\" by the SEC.\n\n\"Like a bull seeing red, the SEC En Banc plowed through law and jurisprudence to reach its mark - the death of Rappler. The SEC En Banc violated the hierarchy of courts and ignored procedure. These actions have no place in a democratic state,\" said the decision penned by Associate Justice Emily San Gaspar-Gito, with concurrences from Associate Justices Ramon Cruz and Raymond Joseph Javier.\n\nThe CA reiterated that Omidyar's donation has removed the problem.\n\n\"As thoroughly discussed, the execution of the Waiver has already eliminated any and all Constitutional violations committed by petitioners.\"\n\nThat the SEC did not take this into consideration when they were ordered to reevaluate their decision in 2018 was grave abuse of discretion on their part, said the appellate court. \"Relying on its interpretation of the word 'evaluate,' the SEC EN Banc then proceeded to resolve the issue in isolation, without allowing petitioners to submit evidence or participate in the so-called 'evaluation.\"\n\nIt added: \"SEC En Banc chose to ignore its order and evaluated the legal effect of Omidyar's donation without even bothering to look at the donation itself. Worse, it actively avoided giving petitioners the opportunity to present the same,\" said the CA.\n\n\"SEC En Banc's ruling goes well beyond mere failure to understand the CA 12th Division's ruling, it displays willful defiance that exceeds even the threshold of grave abuse of discretion,\" the decision added.\n\nThe SEC took issue with the terms of Omidyar's PDR with Rappler, ruling that it gave foreigners control of a media company which is supposed to be wholly Filipino-owned.\n\nThe CA said that Omidyar's PDR did not amount to ownership. The agreement allowed the PDR holder to buy shares on one condition -- \"if the holder is permitted by Philippine laws to hold shares.\" Since Omidyar is not constitutionally allowed to buy shares, the CA said the agreement prevented that from happening.\n\n\"The terms of the PDRs clearly show that Rappler Holdings retained full ownership of the underlying shares,\" said the CA.\n\n\"Consequently, under the terms of the PDRs, Omidyar is not even given a potential ownership right, or the option to become an owner of Rappler Holding's shares. Instead...the only option of a non-Filipino PDR holder is to sell or transfer the PDRs to another holder,\" the decision added.\n\nAs Rappler was battling for its corporate existence for the last six years since 2018, supporters of the Duterte government tried to frame it as a pure corporate issue not related to press freedom. This CA decision dedicated the last 7 pages of its 48-page decision to freedom of the press.\n\nFor the CA, the 1987 Constitution's limits on foreign ownership was not a \"narrow\" vision, and should not be used to trample on the free press. \"This Court does not agree with the SEC En Ban's draconian interpretation that mere violation of the same, at any point in time, and even if such violation was cured, should warrant the obliteration of a mass media entity,\" said the CA.\n\nThe CA pointed out that PDRs are regular financial instruments and that \"there is also no law or regulation directly prohibiting the issuance of PDRs by mass media companies or even public utilities.\"\n\nThe Constitution, the CA said, \"is far more complex...\" in that it envisioned the free press as a key player in the free marketplace of ideas. \"Clearly, the framers of the Constitution sought to enable a multitude of mass media entities to function, owned by a variety of persons and corporations. This was to ensure the birth of a marketplace of ideas, which was non-existent in darker days,\" said the decision.\n\nRappler's latest legal victory brought down its cases down to two: the cyberlibel conviction being appealed by CEO and Nobel peace prize winner Maria Ressa in the Supreme Court and one remaining anti-dummy case pending in a Pasig City court.\n\nThe anti-dummy case was an offshoot of this SEC case, in which the Duterte-time Department of Justice theorized that the PDRs amounted to taxable income which was not rightfully declared. The twin tax cases of this anti-dummy case were all dismissed in 2023. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Thus, it has no knowledge whatsoever of the terms of the donation, nor has it even reviewed the donation itself,\" it said.\n\nThe decision was penned by Associate Justice Emily San Gaspar-Gito, with Associate Justices Ramon Cruz and Raymond Joseph Javier concurring.\n\nNo foreign control\n\nMeanwhile, the court said that there was no ground to revoke Rappler's certificates as there is no foreign control over the organization.\n\n\"The facts show that Rappler Holdings, and by extension Rappler, are currently wholly owned and managed by Filipinos, in compliance with the Constitutional mandate,\" the CA said.\n\nThe CA said that the terms of the PDRs clearly show that Rapper Holdings retained full ownership and underlying shares.\n\nIt also found that Rappler Holdings retained \"full beneficial ownership\" as it retained its voting rights, the right to receive dividends, and the right to sell the underlying shares.\n\n'Like a bull seeing red'\n\nMeanwhile, the CA said that the SEC En Banc and the SEC Special Panel that handled the Rappler case \"bent over backward\" to justify the revocation of the certificates.\n\n\"Like a bull seeing red, the SEC En Banc plowed through law and jurisprudence to reach its mark - the death of Rappler. The SEC En Banc violated the hierarchy of courts and ignored procedure,\" it said.\n\n\"These actions have no place in a democratic state,\" it added.\n\nWhen sought for comment, the SEC said it has yet to receive an official copy of the decision. -- VDV, GMA Integrated News", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joahna_lei_casilao@gmanetwork.com", "name": "Joahna Lei Casilao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rappler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_incorporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Certificate of incorporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omidyar_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omidyar Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMA_Integrated_News_and_Public_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GMA Integrated News and Public Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2024/08/Copy_of_Copy_of_GNO_1-2_2024_08_09_14_38_41.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803473", "eventUri": "eng-9803473", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 293, "textEnd": 300}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

When the rule of law prevails, justice is served.\n\nIt's a vindication after a tortuous eight years of harassment. The CA was unequivocal in its rejection of the SEC's 2018 shutdown order, declaring it \"illegal\" and a \"grave abuse of discretion.\"\n\nWe have always asserted that the SEC en banc violated the law and its own procedures when it handed down its harsh verdict against Rappler on January 11, 2018, following a short probe into allegations that the Philippine Depositary Receipt that Rappler issued to foreign investor Omidyar violated the constitutional ban on foreign control of a media company.\n\nWe are a Filipino company. We are independent.\n\nIt brings us relief and joy that the CA is standing with us -- and with journalism.

Please stop appealing. We've had eight years of harassment,\" Ressa said during Rappler's press conference on Friday, August 9. \"For me, we have continued fighting the battle. Our legal cases, the appeals have continued. Even though we've won the five tax evasion charges. They've, again, filed it. They've appealed it.\"\n\nOn Friday, the CA granted Rappler's petition and voided the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) shutdown order issued in 2018 - at the height of former president Rodrigo Duterte's administration. The CA's decision is very important to Rappler as the order restored the company's certificate of incorporation and eliminated risks of its offices being shutdown.\n\nThe CA decision brought Ressa and Rappler's cases down to two: a cyber libel charge pending before the Supreme Court, and a anti-dummy case pending before a Pasig City court. The last two legal victories were tax evasion charges, where the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) and a Pasig City court had already cleared Ressa and Rappler.\n\nBut shortly after Rappler's legal victory in Pasig City, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) has sought the reversal of the court's ruling. The CTA already junked the OSG's appeal last month. Still pending with the CTA is the OSG's other petition that seeks to nullify the tax court's decision in favor of Rappler.\n\nThe OSG led by Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra has a history of appealing lost cases filed during Duterte's time, like in the cases of former senator Leila de Lima and journalist Lady Ann Salem. Guevarra was Duterte's justice secretary.\n\n\"Well, I won't be surprised if the SEC will take this all the way to the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter of our cases. But I don't want to preempt the Supreme Court. But as a lawyer, again, looking at it objectively, I don't see any reason why the Supreme Court will reverse it. I'm just talking. I'm just talking as a lawyer, very objective for that matter,\" lawyer Francis Lim, Rappler's lead counsel said.\n\n\"So there is a remedy available to the SEC and the Solicitor General Office if they want to exercise that prerogative. But I'm keeping my fingers crossed that things will stop here.\"\n\nWhen asked if presidency had influenced the case's outcome in any way, Lim said: \"I have not seen or felt anything where President Marcos has tried to influence our courts of law, especially in this case... As to the former president, I don't want to comment, to say the least.\"\n\nAll charges against Ressa and Rappler, including tax evasion and cyber libel cases, were all filed under Duterte's time.\n\n\"[The cases] also taught us this other thing of you have to hold the line. We didn't step back from it. We were pummeled for not stepping back. But now it's right side up again. So it shouldn't be political. Law should not be political,\" Ressa said.\n\nReading Rappler's statement on Friday, Ressa retold how the Duterte-time shutdown order has impacted the newsroom. Because of the shutdown order, Ressa said banks refused to engage business with Rappler and clients shied away from advertising with the newsroom. She added that Rappler was also forced to close its Jakarta, Indonesia bureau and could not even open a bank account outside the country.\n\n\"Right after the SEC revoked our license to operate, within four months, we dropped 49% of our advertising revenue. We shouldn't have survived 2018. But this is where you begin, you have to look at crisis as opportunity. We were able to pivot and look at, create a sustainable, a separate sustainable business model,\" the Rappler CEO said.\n\nJournalists and the media continue to face threats and harassments. During the press conference, Ressa highlighted anew the importance of collaboration among journalists.\n\n\"Every country around the world now, journalists have come under attack in some way. And I think what we need to try to do is to collaborate more closely together because the fragmented environment that social media has created. When was the time when we built on each other's investigative stories? Right? There was a time when that was the case. We don't do that often enough now,\" Ressa explained.\n\n\"Our distribution system degrades and commodifies journalism. Social media rewards the worst of journalism.

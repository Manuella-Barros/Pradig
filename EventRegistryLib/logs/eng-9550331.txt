Tufts told the judge that Fears presented an unusually active approach to the counterprotesters standing around statue of Jefferson.\n\n\"His actions in 2017 were differentiated from other defendants,\" said Tufts. \"That included him using a torch to hit an individual.\"\n\nVideo posted by the left-wing media service Unicorn Riot showed Fears swinging his torch at a counterprotester while shouting, \"Die, commie.\"\n\nLawyers for some other defendants arrested long after these events have spoken critically of the prosecution, calling it political. Others have noted that their clients have been plucked from families and jobs more than six years after the events. But not Fears.\n\nAt the time of his Albemarle County indictment, he was plucked from a Texas jail cell where he was serving a five-year sentence for strangling a girlfriend. Fears has a prior Texas felony conviction for aggravated kidnapping as well as misdemeanor convictions for drunk driving and conspiracy to commit criminal trespass and conspiracy to receive stolen property.\n\nTuesday's hearing had been slated to consider a motion to oust his attorney, and the judge asked Fears about that.\n\n\"I want to withdraw that motion,\" he replied.\n\nHe then said he wished to also withdraw the motions he filed urging the ouster of the judge and prosecutor on the case.\n\n\"I do have some concerns about the whole system of public defense,\" Fears said as he sat beside his court-appointed lawyer, Bryan Jones.\n\nFears complained that lawyers seem \"overburdened,\" and then the judge asked if he were satisfied with the representation he has received.\n\n\"We're good,\" he said.\n\nLate last year, in a friend's now-deleted social media post, Fears vowed to protest the prosecution by engaging in a hunger strike at Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail.\n\n\"The protest is in solidarity with all who are being oppressed by the weaponized justice system as well as a continued protest against the desecration of my dead forefathers,\" he allegedly wrote. \"My political imprisonment from this time forward will be met with absolute resistance.\"\n\nIt was a less peaceful resistance that Fears urged at Unite the Right, a rally planned in Charlottesville the day after the march across Grounds. Aug. 12, 2017, will live in infamy after an avowed neo-Nazi drove his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one and injuring several others. More than an hour before that, amid the chaos that had broken out, Fears grew frustrated that counterprotesters kept grabbing at the flag he was carrying, the standard of a White nationalist organization.\n\n\"Shoot me,\" Fears shouted at them. \"Fire the first shot of the race war, baby.\"\n\nAppearing in court Tuesday, Fears appeared healthy in body, but it's a body that is headed for more jail time. The full sentence that Higgins pronounced is a five-year term with four years suspended and a demand for five years of good behavior.\n\nThe prosecutor revealed that when this sentence ends, the state of Pennsylvania may detain Fears, as he allegedly failed to appear for sentencing on a 2007 conviction for a felonious transfer of firearms.\n\nAlbemarle County is pursuing charges against roughy a dozen other men who participated in the 2017 march, charging them with burning an object on public or trespassed land with the intent to racially intimidate, what's often called Virginia's \"cross-burning statute\" which was designed to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan in the Jim Crow era.\n\nFears' brother Colton Fears has previously pleaded guilty in a related case but won't learn his sentence until August. The first defendant to let a jury weigh his claim of protected speech, Jacob Joseph Dix of Clarksville, Ohio, goes to trial on June 4.\n\nHawes Spencer (434)

Tufts told the judge that Fears presented an unusually active approach to the counterprotesters standing around statue of Jefferson.\n\n\"His actions in 2017 were differentiated from other defendants,\" said Tufts. \"That included him using a torch to hit an individual.\"\n\nVideo posted by the left-wing media service Unicorn Riot showed Fears swinging his torch at a counterprotester while shouting, \"Die, commie.\"\n\nLawyers for some other defendants arrested long after these events have spoken critically of the prosecution, calling it political. Others have noted that their clients have been plucked from families and jobs more than six years after the events. But not Fears.\n\nAt the time of his Albemarle County indictment, he was plucked from a Texas jail cell where he was serving a five-year sentence for strangling a girlfriend. Fears has a prior Texas felony conviction for aggravated kidnapping as well as misdemeanor convictions for drunk driving and conspiracy to commit criminal trespass and conspiracy to receive stolen property.\n\nTuesday's hearing had been slated to consider a motion to oust his attorney, and the judge asked Fears about that.\n\n\"I want to withdraw that motion,\" he replied.\n\nHe then said he wished to also withdraw the motions he filed urging the ouster of the judge and prosecutor on the case.\n\n\"I do have some concerns about the whole system of public defense,\" Fears said as he sat beside his court-appointed lawyer, Bryan Jones.\n\nFears complained that lawyers seem \"overburdened,\" and then the judge asked if he were satisfied with the representation he has received.\n\n\"We're good,\" he said.\n\nLate last year, in a friend's now-deleted social media post, Fears vowed to protest the prosecution by engaging in a hunger strike at Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail.\n\n\"The protest is in solidarity with all who are being oppressed by the weaponized justice system as well as a continued protest against the desecration of my dead forefathers,\" he allegedly wrote. \"My political imprisonment from this time forward will be met with absolute resistance.\"\n\nIt was a less peaceful resistance that Fears urged at Unite the Right, a rally planned in Charlottesville the day after the march across Grounds. Aug. 12, 2017, will live in infamy after an avowed neo-Nazi drove his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one and injuring several others. More than an hour before that, amid the chaos that had broken out, Fears grew frustrated that counterprotesters kept grabbing at the flag he was carrying, the standard of a White nationalist organization.\n\n\"Shoot me,\" Fears shouted at them. \"Fire the first shot of the race war, baby.\"\n\nAppearing in court Tuesday, Fears appeared healthy in body, but it's a body that is headed for more jail time. The full sentence that Higgins pronounced is a five-year term with four years suspended and a demand for five years of good behavior.\n\nThe prosecutor revealed that when this sentence ends, the state of Pennsylvania may detain Fears, as he allegedly failed to appear for sentencing on a 2007 conviction for a felonious transfer of firearms.\n\nAlbemarle County is pursuing charges against roughy a dozen other men who participated in the 2017 march, charging them with burning an object on public or trespassed land with the intent to racially intimidate, what's often called Virginia's \"cross-burning statute\" which was designed to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan in the Jim Crow era.\n\nFears' brother Colton Fears has previously pleaded guilty in a related case but won't learn his sentence until August. The first defendant to let a jury weigh his claim of protected speech, Jacob Joseph Dix of Clarksville, Ohio, goes to trial on June 4.\n\nPhotos from the deadly white nationalist rally in

Others have noted that their clients have been plucked from families and jobs more than six years after the events. {snip}", "source": {"uri": "amren.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Renaissance"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_wolff@amren.com", "name": "Henry Wolff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufts_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tufts University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albemarle_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albemarle County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albemarle County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood and Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alford_plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alford plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawton,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawton, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lawton, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Founding Fathers of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ARLogo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550331", "eventUri": "eng-9550331", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 820, "textEnd": 833}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Tyler ISD recently had to fire a teacher's aide for having an inappropriate relationship with a student but was also accused of inappropriate touching and soliciting photos of other students.\n\n20-year-old JBraylon Dewayne Fears was fired from Tyler ISD after a staff member reported their concerns on the Safe2SpeakUp! App. Fears was fired immediately and information was turned over to police. Fears was arrested on Thursday, May 2, and booked into the Smith County Jail on online solicitation of a minor, employing a child for a sexual performance and two counts of improper relationship with a student charges. His bond was set at $600,000.\n\nFears was in a teacher-student relationship with a student from another Tyler ISD campus reports state. Students also told police that Fears would flirt with them, touch them inappropriately and ask for photos of them through Snapchat (CBS 19).\n\nWhen questioned by police, Fears denied any of the accusations. It wasn't until text messages between him and the student he was in a relationship with were brought up that he admitted to the relationship. He also admitted to requesting photos from other students.\n\nTyler ISD has a zero tolerance policy in place for its teachers and employees that results in immediate termination and information turned over to authorities. A letter was sent to parents explaining what happened. Students will also have access to counselors on campus to talk about this situation.", "source": {"uri": "kicks105.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KICKS 105"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gibson@kicks105.com", "name": "Michael Gibson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tyler, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smith County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Smith County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zero tolerance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/156/files/2024/05/attachment-Tyler-ISD-Teacher-Aide-Fired-Smith-County-Jail-unsplash.com_.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550331", "eventUri": "eng-9550331", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 752, "textEnd": 757}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

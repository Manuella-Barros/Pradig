{"id": 225036768, "title": "Hollywood movies rarely reflect climate change crisis. These researchers want to change that", "text": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Aquaman might not mind if the oceans rise, but moviegoers might. That\u2019s one of the takeaways from a new study conducted by researchers who set out to determine if today\u2019s Hollywood blockbusters are reflective of the current climate crisis. The vast majority of movies failed the \u201cclimate reality check\u201d proposed by the authors, who surveyed 250 movies from 2013 to 2022. The test is simple \u2014 the authors looked to see if a movie presented a story in which climate change exists, and whether a character knows it does. One film that passed the test was the 2017 superhero movie \u201cJustice League, \u201d in which Jason Momoa\u2019s Aquaman character says, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t mind if the oceans rise\u201d to Ben Affleck\u2019s Bruce Wayne. But most movies fell short \u2014 fewer than 10% of the 250 films passed, and climate change was mentioned in two or more scenes of fewer than 4% of the films. That\u2019s out of touch with a moviegoing public that wants \u201cto see their reality reflected on screen,\u201d said Colby College English professor Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, lead researcher on the study. \u201cThe top line is just that the vast majority of films, popular films produced over the last 10 years in the United States, are not portraying the world as it is,\u201d Schneider-Mayerson said. \u201cThey are portraying a world that is now history or fantasy \u2014 a world in which climate change is not happening.\u201d Researchers at Maine\u2019s Colby College published the study in April along with Good Energy, a Los Angeles-based environmental consultancy. The results were peer reviewed, and the authors are seeking publication in scientific journals. The researchers view the test as a way for audience members, writers and filmmakers to evaluate the representation of climate change on screen. Some results were surprising. Movies that at first glance appear to have little overlap with climate or the environment passed the test. \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d Noah Baumbach\u2019s emotive 2019 drama about the collapse of a relationship, passed the test in part because Adam Driver\u2019s character is described as \u201cenergy conscious,\u201d Schneider-Mayerson said. The 2022 whodunnit \u201cGlass Onion\u201d and the 2019 folk horror movie \u201cMidsommar\u201d were others to pass the test. Some that were more explicitly about climate change, such as the 2021 satire \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up,\u201d also passed. But \u201cSan Andreas,\u201d a 2015 movie about a West Coast earthquake disaster, and \u201cThe Meg,\u201d a 2018 action movie set in the ocean, did not. The authors narrowed the selection of movies by excluding films not set on Earth or set before 2006 or after 2100. They found streaming services had a higher percentage of movies that included climate change than the major studios did. The study is \u201cvaluable for marketing purposes, informational purposes, data accumulation,\u201d said Harry Winer, director of sustainability at the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Winer, who was not involved in the study, said it could also help serve as an incentive to connect audiences with climate stories. \u201cThe audience will be more open to hearing a dialogue about what is right and what is wrong,\u201d Winer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation starter.\u201d The study authors said they see the climate reality check as a kind of Bechdel-Wallace test for climate change. Alison Bechdel, a cartoonist, is credited with popularizing that test in the 1980s by incorporating her friend Liz Wallace\u2019s test about gender representation in film into a comic strip. The test asks if a movie includes at least two female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. Bechdel herself spoke highly of the study\u2019s climate test, which she described as \u201clong overdue\u201d in a social media post during this year\u2019s Academy Awards season. Bechdel said in an e-mail to The Associated Press that \u201cfor a movie set in the present to ignore this existential threat just doesn\u2019t make sense anymore\u201d in the age of climate change. \u201cI do worry that screenwriters might do it in a kind of rote way, which could be counterproductive, just like rote \u2018strong female characters\u2019 are,\u201d Bechdel said. \u201cBut injecting an awareness of our communal plight into the stories we ingest seems like a no-brainer.\u201d", "summary": "<p>PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Aquaman might not mind if the oceans rise, but moviegoers might.

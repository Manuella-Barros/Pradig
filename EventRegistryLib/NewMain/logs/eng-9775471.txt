and give parents and kids the option to delete their information from social media platforms.\n\nTop U.S. social media platforms made an estimated $11 billion in advertising revenue from users younger than 18 in 2022, according to a Harvard study published last year.\n\nKOSA would make explicit a \"duty of care\" that social media companies have when it comes to minors using their products, focusing on design of the platforms and regulation of the companies.\n\nExecutives at social media sites Snap Inc and X said at a congressional hearing in January that they supported KOSA, while Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew said they disagreed with parts of it.\n\nTech industry groups and the American Civil Liberties Union have criticized the bill, saying that differing interpretations of harmful content could result in minors losing access to content related to vaccines, abortion or LGBTQ issues.\n\nSenators amended the language of the bill in response to such concerns earlier this year, in part by limiting the enforcement responsibility of states' attorneys general.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director at Fairplay for Kids, a group that supports the bills, said KOSA requires companies to mitigate specific risks, such as content that promotes eating disorders.\n\n\"Obviously government officials can do things that are not legal, but this does not give government officials any legal basis for censorship,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Moira Warburton in Washington and Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by

However, the legislation's future remains uncertain in the House of Representatives, where it has received mixed reactions from the tech industry, a recent report from Reuters reads.\n\nLast week, the Senate gave bipartisan approval to the bills in a procedural vote, with 86 senators in favor and only one against.

This should have been a reality much earlier, if you ask me.\n\nA Harvard study published last year estimated that major US social media platforms generated approximately $11 billion in advertising revenue from users under 18 in 2022.

In response to these concerns, senators revised the bill's language earlier this year, including limiting the enforcement powers of state attorneys general.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director of Fairplay for Kids, a group supporting the legislation, stated that KOSA requires companies to address specific risks, such as content promoting eating disorders. He emphasized that the bill does not provide a legal basis for government censorship.\n\nWith each day that passes, the negative effects of the Internet on kids are becoming more and more apparent.

Two bills - the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act and the Kids Online Safety Act, nicknamed COPPA 2.0 and KOSA - would need to pass in the Republican-controlled House, currently on recess until September, to become law.\n\nThe Senate approved the bills in a rare bipartisan 91-3 vote. COPPA 2.0 would ban targeted advertising to minors and data collection without their consent, and give parents and kids the option to delete their information from social media platforms.\n\n\"Kids are not your product, kids are not your profit source, and we are going to protect them in the virtual space,\" Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican cosponsor of KOSA, said in a press conference after Tuesday's vote. Maurine Molak, cofounder of ParentsSOS, a group of parents who said their children's deaths were\n\nlinked to social media , called the vote a \"historic and emotional milestone for myself and for all parents who have fought tirelessly to protect our children.\"\n\nTop U.S. social media platforms made an estimated $11 billion in advertising revenue from users younger than 18 in 2022, according to a Harvard study published last year.

CRITICS REMAIN\n\nTech industry groups and the American Civil Liberties Union have criticized the bill, saying that differing interpretations of harmful content could result in minors losing access to content related to vaccines, abortion or LGBTQ issues. Senators amended the language of the bill in response to such concerns earlier this year, in part by limiting the enforcement responsibility of states' attorneys general.\n\nHowever even after the changes, critics remained. \"They made improvements, but not enough,\" Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, told reporters on Monday night. \"I still think it is going to harm a lot of LGBTQ kids because of the way it's going to make it difficult for them to get information.\"\n\nHe was one of the three votes against the bill on Tuesday. Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that receives funding from Meta, Google and other major technology companies, called the bills flawed. KOSA would open the door to censorship and COPPA 2.0 would cut off revenue for services aimed at teens, the group said.\n\n\"This country needs children's online safety and privacy legislation that strikes the right balance between protecting consumers without infringing on their free speech rights or stifling innovation,\" ITIF Senior Policy Manager Ash Johnson said.\n\n(This story has not been

KOSA would open the door to censorship and COPPA 2.0 would cut off revenue for services aimed at teens, the group said.\n\n\"This country needs children's online safety and privacy legislation that strikes the right balance between protecting consumers without infringing on their free speech rights or stifling innovation,\" ITIF Senior Policy Manager Ash Johnson said.

KOSA would open the door to censorship and COPPA 2.0 would cut off revenue for services aimed at teens, the group said.\n\n\"This country needs children's online safety and privacy legislation that

KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades, and it's a very good first step,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe legislation was drawn up in consultation with parents of teens who had been bullied or sexually exploited but has been opposed by some free speech groups worried that it could lead to censorship.\n\n- 'Duty of care' -\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement in a politically divided Congress on curbing the negative impacts of social media, there has never been a united path on how to go about doing so.\n\nHouse members are on their summer recess and will almost certainly be focusing on averting a looming government shutdown when they return in September.\n\nBut Schumer called on the lower chamber to pass the bills immediately on its return, urging lawmakers to \"seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk.\"\n\nThe KOSA bill would establish a \"duty of care\" obligation on the online platforms that would demand that special provisions are in place to shield minors from toxic content.\n\nSupported by Microsoft, X and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, the legislation would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content -- including sexual exploitation, online bullying, the promotion of suicide and eating disorders.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a public apology to the families of victims at the Senate Judiciary Committee in January as hostile lawmakers grilled tech CEOs over the dangers that children face on social media.\n\n\"I'm sorry for everything you have all been through,\" he said. \"No one should go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\n\n- Censorship fears -\n\nSeven LGBTQ advocacy groups withdrew initial opposition based on updates to the bill they said mitigated concerns that teens would be limited in accessing information about gender identity, sexuality and reproductive health.\n\nBut free speech groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that the definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship.\n\nCOPPA would beef up privacy standards for Americans aged under 17, and outlaw advertising targeted at children and teens -- requiring companies to allow users to delete personal information.\n\n\"Too many kids experience relentless promotion of suicide or substance abuse material. Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"With studies showing that kids today spend more time on social media than ever before, now is the moment to pass KOSA, pass COPPA, and instill guardrails that protect kids from these risks.\"\n\nBut Oregan Democrat Ron Wyden posted on X that the tweaks to KOSA \"remain insufficient\" and voiced fears that a hard-right future Republican administration could \"still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans and reproductive health information.\"\n\nft/nro", "source": {"uri":

'I still think it is going to harm a lot of LGBTQ kids because of the way it's going to make it difficult for them to get information.'\n\nHe was one of the three votes against the bill on Tuesday.\n\nInformation Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that receives funding from Meta, Google GOOGL.O and other major technology companies, called the bills flawed. KOSA would open the door to censorship and COPPA 2.0 would cut off revenue for services aimed at teens, the group said.\n\n'This country needs children's online safety and privacy legislation that strikes the right balance between protecting consumers without infringing on their free speech rights or stifling innovation,' ITIF Senior Policy Manager Ash Johnson said.\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada.

Combined, they will offer a slew of new rules and regulations regarding how social media and tech companies treat minors' data and what features are available to them.\n\nThe bills passed by a 91-3 vote. Two Republican Senators -- Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah -- and Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden voted against their passage.\n\n\"At its core, [KOSA] is a product design bill,\" the law's sponsor, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said in a floor speech ahead of the vote, likening KOSA to requiring seat belts in cars or placing choking warnings on toys with small parts designed for children.\n\nKOSA would require tech companies to design online platforms in ways that would mitigate or prevent harming users, including cyberbullying, sexual exploitation, and drug use. The bill would also require platforms to limit the ability of adult users to speak with minors and offer parental tools that allow guardians to manage their privacy.\n\nThe other bill, COPPA 2.0, would ban targeted advertising to minors and the collection of data without their consent. It would also give parents and children the option to delete their information from social media platforms.\n\nThe Senate's approval of the package puts the pressure on the House of Representatives to weigh in. The Republican-controlled House has recessed until September and will have a short amount of time to debate and consider the legislation. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican representing Louisiana, has said he will try to find a consensus on the bill, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIf passed, the legislation will be the first laws Congress has passed to protect children online since 1998, well before Facebook was founded and the iPhone was created.\n\nBut both bills have faced -- and continue to face -- heavy opposition across the political spectrum.\n\n\"Parents need solutions that are legal and meaningful, but KOSA is neither. KOSA's data privacy, cybersecurity, censorship, and constitutional risks remain unaddressed,\" Carl Szabo, NetChoice's vice president and general counsel, said in a statement Tuesday, lamenting the bill's passage in the Senate. \"Lawmakers must recognize that an unconstitutional law will help no one.\"\n\nNetChoice -- a trade association that represents 37 tech organizations -- claims that KOSA is likely unconstitutional, pointing to four prior court decisions that have supported its efforts to strike down similar state laws. Major members include Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, Pinterest, Google and Amazon. At least two members, Elon Musk's X and Snap, have publicly endorsed KOSA.\n\nChris Marchese, the director of the litigation at the tech industry trade association NetChoice, has said that tech industry groups, nonpartisan groups, and free-speech advocates will challenge the bills in the courts, according to RollCall. Groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Chamber of Progress, and the American Civil Liberties Union have come out against the bills.\n\n\"KOSA compounds nationwide attacks on young peoples' right to learn and access information, on and offline,\" said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, in a statement that pointed to book bans and classroom censorship laws. \"The House must block this dangerous bill before it's too late.\"\n\nSeveral critics of the bill have raised concerns that KOSA may be used to target members of the LGBTQ community and their content. The EFF warns that KOSA could be used by political actors looking to \"score political points\" with their peers or constituents to abuse the law by going after speech they don't like.", "source":

The House has just begun its six-week summer recess and won't return to Washington until Sept. 9. And while he's supportive of the \"purpose\" of the bills, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he's still reviewing the legislation and hasn't scheduled a vote.\n\nThe two bills in the package -- known as the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, and the Children's and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA 2.0 -- represent the most significant congressional action in decades to regulate social media's impact on children and teens.\n\nThe lopsided vote was 91-3, with Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and GOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, as the only no votes.\n\n\"This is why we came here -- to get things done and do it in a bipartisan way that literally will save lives,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a former state attorney general, who teamed with Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., on authoring KOSA, said in an interview last week.\n\n\"What we're doing is giving parents and kids the tools to disconnect from harmful content, bullying, eating disorders, stuff that really hurts them, and also impose a duty of care on Big Tech that for too long, has said 'trust us' and betrayed that trust,\" Blumenthal continued. \"And now, they're going to have to comply with a law that imposes a duty on them to mitigate or prevent harm.\"\n\nKOSA would require social media companies to provide better protections for users under age 17. It also would require companies to provide guardians with more control over minors' use of a platform and prevent certain features, such as autoplay. And it would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content.\n\nCOPPA 2.0, written by Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., would create stronger online privacy protections for anyone under age 17. It would also bar targeted advertising to kids and teens and create an eraser button for parents and kids by requiring companies to allow users to delete information.\n\nThe Senate action comes three months after Biden signed legislation that would ban the video-sharing app TikTok in the U.S. after the election unless its Chinese owner sells it.\n\nSome tech companies, like Microsoft and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, have endorsed KOSA. Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, offered suggestions on how to improve the bill, while some other social media companies have not taken a formal position.\n\n\"We support the development of age-appropriate standards for teens online, and appreciate KOSA's attempt to create a consistent set of rules for the industry to follow,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"However, we think there's a better way to help parents oversee their teens' online experiences: federal legislation should require app stores to get parents' approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps.\"\n\nOpponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union and other free speech and civil liberties groups, argue that the bill's definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship of content that promotes politically polarizing issues, gender equality or abortion rights.\n\n\"I fear this bill could be used to sue services that offer privacy-enhancing technologies like encryption or anonymity features that are essential to young people's ability to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by predators online,\" said Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., explaining why he voted no.\n\nBut in recent months, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., worked closely with Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and the bills' sponsors -- Blumenthal, Blackburn, Markey and Cassidy -- to address concerns and build support.\n\n\"Today, after a lot of hard work and a lot of twists and turns, we will pass KOSA and COPPA,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Tuesday before the vote. \"KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades. And it's a very good first step.\"\n\nThe leader said social media has benefits but also significant risks for children's safety. He called on the House to quickly take up the online safety package when the chamber returns in September.\n\n\"These bills have real bipartisan momentum, so we should seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe Republican-led House, however, is looking to put its own mark on the legislation. Before the recess, Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, D-Wash., said her full committee is \"planning to move forward\" with marking up both bills -- a process that could include changes to the bills that would need to pass the full House and then the Senate again before becoming law.\n\n\"It's very important that Congress act,\" McMorris Rodgers, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year, said in an interview.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson appeared bullish about passing the bills through the House before this Congress ends in January.\n\n\"We're looking at details of it. Obviously, I believe in the purpose of the legislation. I think it's really important,\" the speaker said. \"But there's a couple of questions we have about the details, but I think we can work it out and I'd like to get it done.\"\n\nKOSA was drafted following a series of emotional and powerful hearings focused on the harms of social media on young people. Parents testified about how social media had driven their children to commit suicide or led to other harm. And senators demanded social media executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, apologize to the parents in the room as they held photos of their deceased loved ones.\n\nThese parents made the case \"that our children are not a product that can be exploited by these social media companies,\" Blackburn said in a joint interview with Blumenthal. \"As we did hearings, they stepped forward, they told their stories. They came to us and they said, 'Let us be a part of this. Let us help.'\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

The Senate voted 86-1 last Thursday to advance the bills forward to a final vote Tuesday.\n\nKOSA would require tech companies to design online platforms in ways that would mitigate or prevent harming users, including cyberbullying, sexual exploitation, and drug use. The bill would also require platforms to limit the ability of adult users to speak with minors and offer parental tools that allow guardians to manage their privacy.\n\nThe other bill, COPPA 2.0, would ban targeted advertising to minors and the collection of data without their consent. It would also give parents and children the option to delete their information from social media platforms.\n\n\"By passing the Kids Online Safety Act, we'll help ensure young people are given the tools & safeguards to take back their online lives,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who introduced KOSA, said ahead of the vote. Blumenthal first introduced a version of the bill three years ago, alongside Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nIt's unclear whether the bills' companions would make it through the House of Representatives, which is controlled by the Republican party and has recessed until September. Those proposals are largely the same as the Senate's, albeit with some distinctions. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican representing Louisiana, has said he will try to find a consensus on the bill, The Associated Press reported.\n\nIf passed, the legislation will be the first laws Congress has passed to protect children online since 1998, well before Facebook was founded and the iPhone was created.\n\nAlthough Blumenthal has said KOSA is \"constitutionally bulletproof,\" it's expected to face a series of challenges should it make it through Congress.\n\nChris Marchese, the director of the litigation at the tech industry trade association NetChoice, has said that tech industry groups, nonpartisan groups, and free-speech advocates will challenge the bills in the courts, according to RollCall. A letter addressed to the Senate opposing KOSA was signed by a number of prominent groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Chamber of Progress and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNetChoice -- which represents 37 tech organizations -- claims that KOSA is likely unconstitutional, pointing to four prior court decisions that have supported its efforts to strike down similar state laws. Its members include most major social media companies, such as Elon Musk's X and Snap -- both of which have endorsed KOSA -- as well as Pinterest and Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. Other major members include Google, Amazon, Netflix, and PayPal.\n\n\"KOSA fails to meet basic constitutional principles and fails parents because it won't make a single child safer online or address their concerns,\" Carl Szabo, NetChoice's vice president and general counsel, said in a statement last week. Szabo added that provisions requiring guardians to give platforms their kids' personal information is \"both dangerous and a violation of their rights.\"\n\nAnother point of contention from critics is that dangerous content could apply to a vast number of things, depending on the viewpoint of the individual. The EFF has warned that KOSA would provide too much power to state attorneys general to enforce its provisions.\n\nThe Chamber of Progress and several pro-LGBTQ groups sent the Senate a letter in May raising concerns that KOSA may be used to target members of the LGBTQ community and their content. They point to comments from one of KOSA's first sponsors, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who once said the bill would \"protect minor children from the transgender in this culture and that influence.\"", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news",

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called Tuesday's passage of the Kids Online Safety Act \"monumental\" after working for years to get legislation through the Senate that regulates how tech companies design their sites.\n\nThe bill's passage is the culmination of work from Blumenthal and his co-author, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., as well as groups seeking safeguards for minors that include parents who have attributed the deaths of their children to harmful content viewed on social media.\n\nBut the Kids Online Safety Act, commonly referred to as KOSA, faces an uncertain path in the U.S. House amid time constraints for the rest of the year and deep concerns from LGBTQ+, civil rights groups and some youth activists that fear censorship and free speech violations.\n\nAfter a similar overwhelming margin of support in last week's procedural vote, the Senate passed a pair of bills -- the Kids Online Safety Act and the Children's and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act, also known as COPPA 2.0 -- in a 91-3 vote. Both Blumenthal and U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., voted in support of the legislation.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act, commonly referred to as KOSA, would put in place stricter settings by allowing children and parents to disable addictive features, enable privacy settings and opt out of algorithmic recommendations. It establishes a \"duty of care\" that would that would require companies to make efforts to prevent harm to minors related to certain mental health disorders, physical violence, online bullying, eating disorders and sexual exploitation.\n\nKOSA was spurred in large part by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen's congressional testimony in 2021 about the harmful effects of social media on children and teenagers and how tech giants kept users engaged to turn profits.\n\nCOPPA 2.0, led by U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., updates existing law from 1998 to protect children online who are under 13. The current bill would ban targeted advertising to minors and extend protections to users between ages 13 and 16. COPPA 2.0 was also updated earlier this year.\n\n\"It is a complex piece of legislation which has been difficult to craft and address all of the very legitimate concerns that have been raised,\" Blumenthal said about KOSA. \"It's been challenging to navigate the different interests and the timing constraints and the different committees that had potential jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"I think that we're showing that Congress actually can work productively on safeguards dealing with the internet and tech,\" he continued. \"We're putting controls and safeguards on repetitive and addictive unwanted content.\"\n\nWith critics worried about the \"unintended consequences\" of the bill, Blumenthal and Blackburn made additional changes to KOSA in February. Those tweaks eased the concerns of some groups who were initially opposed, while other groups remain deeply unsatisfied with it.\n\nThe authors updated the duty of care section to give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to enforce it through civil action instead of state attorneys general. That change was made in response to fears that elected officials could politicize and police content based on what they view as appropriate and potentially block resources related to health care, politics and gender identity.\n\nSupporters of the bill expect to see another massive lobbying effort by Big Tech in the following weeks to prevent a vote in the House. But some social media companies support KOSA, like Snap and X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nStudents and young users have also done their own lobbying blitzes on Capitol Hill, both for and against the Kids Online Safety Act.\n\nMore than 300 students organized by the American Civil Liberties Union spoke with lawmakers ahead of Tuesday's vote to urge a vote against KOSA.\n\n\"We live on the internet, and we are afraid that important information we've accessed all our lives will no longer be available,\" Anjali Verma, who is a rising high school senior, said in a statement through the ACLU. \"We need lawmakers to listen to young people when making decisions that affect us.\"\n\nOther youth activists, meanwhile, are standing firmly behind KOSA. They are seeking legislation that will protect them from harmful content that continues to pop up on their feeds despite trying to keep it off their accounts.\n\n\"On the long list of priorities that Big Tech has, user choice is at the bottom,\" Isabel Sunderland of Design It For Us said at a briefing last week with Blumenthal, Blackburn and grieving parents. \"We don't have a choice when these companies have finally engineered their platforms to manipulate young people into staying on their sites longer as they deliver vicious platters of addictive, divisive and harmful content.\"\n\nCongress has not passed legislation regulating the use of online platforms for minors in almost two decades, despite a growing desire to do so in both parties.\n\nSupporters and opponents of the Kids Online Safety Act share a similar goal: holding tech giants accountable over how children and teenagers navigate online platforms and reducing harms. But they diverge on how to achieve that outcome.\n\nIn a briefing on Tuesday with groups aligned in opposition to KOSA, Evan Greer of Fight for the Future credited the work of LGBTQ+ minors and groups in securing changes made to the legislation, but argued that it still does not go far enough and is \"effectively a blank check for censorship for any piece of content that an administration could claim is harmful to kids.\"\n\nA letter organized last year by Fight for the Future on behalf of trans and gender-expansive parents argued that the bill would result in more data collection of minors and \"puts trans kids and their families at risk as more and more states move to strip us of our rights and criminalize our kids' health care, education and very existence.\"\n\nFight for the Future said it is \"neutral\" on COPPA 2.0, but the group and others on the call said Congress should instead push for broad privacy legislation that protects both children and adults online as well as bills for more competition across social media.\n\n\"We need strong privacy, antitrust, and algorithmic justice legislation to address the harms of Big Tech's monopoly power and surveillance driven business model, not blatantly unconstitutional censorship bills that will do more harm than good and won't hold up in court,\" Greer said.\n\nThese groups raised concerns about how the Kids Online Safety Act could empower an FTC under a potential Trump administration. Blumenthal said he is \"very sympathetic\" to those concerns, adding that he hopes the Senate could act as a buffer since president-appointed FTC commissioners are confirmed by the upper chamber.\n\n\"If Donald Trump is elected president, any laws on the books can be abused and improperly distorted,\" Blumenthal said. \"The potential for abuse of a new law is not a reason to oppose a law that is absolutely well-founded and well-merited and, in fact, necessary.\"\n\nIf the Kids Online Safety Act becomes law, the measure is expected to face lawsuits.\n\nU.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., one of the three lawmakers who voted against KOSA, similarly shared concerns related to free speech and believes the bill would not hold up in court if it faces legal challenges. Blumenthal has countered that KOSA is \"constitutionally bulletproof.\"\n\nBut the legislation still faces a long road ahead to becoming law as KOSA and COPPA 2.0 move over to the House. The bills have limited time to get a vote with Congress out for the month of August and a short window before and after the November elections.\n\nBlumenthal, Blackburn and other members are talking with colleagues in the GOP-led House to get a vote before the end of the year. U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., and U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., have companion legislation that mirrors KOSA in the House. But some lawmakers would prefer to tackle broad online privacy legislation.\n\nBlumenthal said getting a vote in the House will be his top priority for the remainder of the session, which ends in early January.\n\n\"It is monumental ... but obviously we want a new law, not just a bill passing the Senate. We are very intently and intensely focused on the House,\" Blumenthal said.\n\n\"If it doesn't pass this session for whatever reason, you can be absolutely certain we will be back next session,\" he added. \"We're not surrendering or giving up regardless of the outcome. We will work until the last day of this session to make it a reality.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctmirror.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The CT Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades, and it's a very good first step,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe legislation was drawn up in consultation with parents of teens who had been bullied or sexually exploited but has been opposed by some free speech groups worried that it could lead to censorship.\n\n- 'Duty of care' -\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement in a politically divided Congress on curbing the negative impacts of social media, there has never been a united path on how to go about doing so.\n\nHouse members are on their summer recess and will almost certainly be focusing on averting a looming government shutdown when they return in September.\n\nBut Schumer called on the lower chamber to pass the bills immediately on its return, urging lawmakers to \"seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk.\"\n\nThe KOSA bill would establish a \"duty of care\" obligation on the online platforms that would demand that special provisions are in place to shield minors from toxic content.\n\nSupported by Microsoft, X and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, the legislation would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content -- including sexual exploitation, online bullying, the promotion of suicide and eating disorders.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a public apology to the families of victims at the Senate Judiciary Committee in January as hostile lawmakers grilled tech CEOs over the dangers that children face on social media.\n\n\"I'm sorry for everything you have all been through,\" he said. \"No one should go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\n\n- Censorship fears -\n\nSeven LGBTQ advocacy groups withdrew initial opposition based on updates to the bill they said mitigated concerns that teens would be limited in accessing information about gender identity, sexuality and reproductive health.\n\nBut free speech groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that the definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship.\n\nCOPPA would beef up privacy standards for Americans aged under 17, and outlaw advertising targeted at children and teens -- requiring companies to allow users to delete personal information.\n\n\"Too many kids experience relentless promotion of suicide or substance abuse material. Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"With studies showing that kids today spend more time on social media than ever before, now is the moment to pass KOSA, pass COPPA, and instill guardrails that protect kids from these risks.\"\n\nBut Oregan Democrat Ron Wyden posted on X that the tweaks to KOSA \"remain insufficient\" and voiced fears that a hard-right future Republican administration could \"still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans and reproductive health information.\"", "source": {"uri":

The House has just begun its six-week summer recess and won't return to Washington until Sept. 9. And while he's supportive of the \"purpose\" of the bills, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he's still reviewing the legislation and hasn't scheduled a vote.\n\nThe two bills in the package -- known as the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, and the Children's and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA 2.0 -- represent the most significant congressional action in decades to regulate social media's impact on children and teens.\n\nThe lopsided vote was 91-3, with Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and GOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, as the only no votes.\n\n\"This is why we came here -- to get things done and do it in a bipartisan way that literally will save lives,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a former state attorney general, who teamed with Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., on authoring KOSA, said in an interview last week.\n\n\"What we're doing is giving parents and kids the tools to disconnect from harmful content, bullying, eating disorders, stuff that really hurts them, and also impose a duty of care on Big Tech that for too long, has said 'trust us' and betrayed that trust,\" Blumenthal continued. \"And now, they're going to have to comply with a law that imposes a duty on them to mitigate or prevent harm.\"\n\nKOSA would require social media companies to provide better protections for users under age 17. It also would require companies to provide guardians with more control over minors' use of a platform and prevent certain features, such as autoplay. And it would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content.\n\nCOPPA 2.0, written by Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., would create stronger online privacy protections for anyone under age 17. It would also bar targeted advertising to kids and teens and create an eraser button for parents and kids by requiring companies to allow users to delete information.\n\nThe Senate action comes three months after Biden signed legislation that would ban the video-sharing app TikTok in the U.S. after the election unless its Chinese owner sells it.\n\nSome tech companies, like Microsoft and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, have endorsed KOSA. Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, offered suggestions on how to improve the bill, while some other social media companies have not taken a formal position.\n\n\"We support the development of age-appropriate standards for teens online, and appreciate KOSA's attempt to create a consistent set of rules for the industry to follow,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"However, we think there's a better way to help parents oversee their teens' online experiences: federal legislation should require app stores to get parents' approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps.\"\n\nOpponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union and other free speech and civil liberties groups, argue that the bill's definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship of content that promotes politically polarizing issues, gender equality or abortion rights.\n\n\"I fear this bill could be used to sue services that offer privacy-enhancing technologies like encryption or anonymity features that are essential to young people's ability to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by predators online,\" said Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., explaining why he voted no.\n\nBut in recent months, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., worked closely with Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and the bills' sponsors -- Blumenthal, Blackburn, Markey and Cassidy -- to address concerns and build support.\n\n\"Today, after a lot of hard work and a lot of twists and turns, we will pass KOSA and COPPA,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Tuesday before the vote. \"KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades. And it's a very good first step.\"\n\nThe leader said social media has benefits but also significant risks for children's safety. He called on the House to quickly take up the online safety package when the chamber returns in September.\n\n\"These bills have real bipartisan momentum, so we should seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe Republican-led House, however, is looking to put its own mark on the legislation. Before the recess, Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, D-Wash., said her full committee is \"planning to move forward\" with marking up both bills -- a process that could include changes to the bills that would need to pass the full House and then the Senate again before becoming law.\n\n\"It's very important that Congress act,\" McMorris Rodgers, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year, said in an interview.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson appeared bullish about passing the bills through the House before this Congress ends in January.\n\n\"We're looking at details of it. Obviously, I believe in the purpose of the legislation. I think it's really important,\" the speaker said. \"But there's a couple of questions we have about the details, but I think we can work it out and I'd like to get it done.\"\n\nKOSA was drafted following a series of emotional and powerful hearings focused on the harms of social media on young people. Parents testified about how social media had driven their children to commit suicide or led to other harm. And senators demanded social media executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, apologize to the parents in the room as they held photos of their deceased loved ones.\n\nThese parents made the case \"that our children are not a product that can be exploited by these social media companies,\" Blackburn said in a joint interview with Blumenthal. \"As we did hearings, they stepped forward, they told their stories. They came to us and they said, 'Let us be a part of this. Let us help.'\"\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or chat live at 988lifeline.org.

KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades, and it's a very good first step,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe legislation was drawn up in consultation with parents of teens who had been bullied or sexually exploited but has been opposed by some free speech groups worried that it could lead to censorship.\n\n- 'Duty of care' -\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement in a politically divided Congress on curbing the negative impacts of social media, there has never been a united path on how to go about doing so.\n\nHouse members are on their summer recess and will almost certainly be focusing on averting a looming government shutdown when they return in September.\n\nBut Schumer called on the lower chamber to pass the bills immediately on its return, urging lawmakers to \"seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk.\"\n\nThe KOSA bill would establish a \"duty of care\" obligation on the online platforms that would demand that special provisions are in place to shield minors from toxic content.\n\nSupported by Microsoft, X and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, the legislation would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content -- including sexual exploitation, online bullying, the promotion of suicide and eating disorders.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a public apology to the families of victims at the Senate Judiciary Committee in January as hostile lawmakers grilled tech CEOs over the dangers that children face on social media.\n\n\"I'm sorry for everything you have all been through,\" he said. \"No one should go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\n\n- Censorship fears -\n\nSeven LGBTQ advocacy groups withdrew initial opposition based on updates to the bill they said mitigated concerns that teens would be limited in accessing information about gender identity, sexuality and reproductive health.\n\nBut free speech groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that the definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship.\n\nCOPPA would beef up privacy standards for Americans aged under 17, and outlaw advertising targeted at children and teens -- requiring companies to allow users to delete personal information.\n\n\"Too many kids experience relentless promotion of suicide or substance abuse material. Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"With studies showing that kids today spend more time on social media than ever before, now is the moment to pass KOSA, pass COPPA, and instill guardrails that protect kids from these risks.\"\n\nBut Oregan Democrat Ron Wyden posted on X that the tweaks to KOSA \"remain insufficient\" and voiced fears that a hard-right future Republican administration could \"still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans and reproductive health information.\"\n\nft/nro\n\nMore from this

(Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times)\n\nThe Senate on July 30 overwhelmingly passed legislation to protect children's safety and privacy online.\n\nThe legislation passed in a 91-3 vote. Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah) voted against the measures.\n\n\"The Senate keeps its promise to every parent who's lost a child because of the risks of social media,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor, calling today a \"momentous day\" and a \"historic moment.\" He also urged his colleagues in the House to pass the bills' companion versions \"as soon as they can.\"\n\nThe new bills update a decades-old law to safeguard children's safety on the internet. The rules for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) took effect in 2000, four years before Facebook was created.\n\nOne of the bills, the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA 2.0, expands the age limit for protected minors from 13 to 16 and requires social media platforms to obtain consent from users aged 13 to 16 before collecting their personal information. The bill also bans ads targeting children and teens.\n\nThe other bill, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), addresses tech companies' algorithms for keeping users consuming content. It requires the companies to allow minors to limit the category of recommendations or opt out of personalized recommendation systems that facilitate infinite scrolling.\n\nIn addition, KOSA requires social media companies to take measures to prevent the spread of harmful content related to suicide, eating disorders, bullying, and drugs.\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who led COPPA 2.0, said on the Senate floor that the passage of the bill would mean a \"momentous step to stand up to the big tech lobbying machine to stop the privacy-invasive business model that exploits young people for profit.\" He expressed further concerns about artificial intelligence \"supercharging big tech's algorithms and encouraging platforms to collect more data on young people.\"\n\nBoth Mr. Schumer and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), author of KOSA, praised parents who lost their children over online harm for turning grief into action. Both of them spoke of their experience of talking to the mothers. Mr. Blumenthal said one mother's questions about big tech deeply touched him: \"I'm haunted by one of the moms who said to us early on -- I think speaking on behalf of so many of them and us, 'When will you stop them from killing people? When will you stop them from killing our children?'\"\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a co-sponsor of KOSA, said more needs to be done but that the bill \"goes in the right direction.\"\n\nAs the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, he has urged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to compensate grieving parents.\n\n\"We need to allow parents to get their kids' data back, but it is a step forward to say you can't track and you can't target,\" he told The Epoch Times on Monday. \"It's a step forward to get parents some enforceable rights.\"\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and another KOSA co-sponsor, said she was \"very concerned about the disregard that large mediums have for the welfare of children.\"\n\n\"They know that their algorithms are used to target the very young -- meaning under age 13 and another bill 13 to 16 -- with advertising that diminishes the mental health of young people,\" she told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"They know that, and they're not dealing with it. And so, when they won't deal with it, we have to protect children.\"\n\nLast Thursday, senators voted 86-1 to end the debate on the two bills and advance them to the floor. During the procedural vote last week, Sen. Rand Paul (R-K.Y.) was the only one who voted \"no.\"\n\nHe objected to KOSA and said it was too broad. He said it would create a Kids Online Safety Council that he considered \"speech police.\" He said KOSA would cause \"fear of liability, fear of lawsuits\" and lead to self-censorship by social media platforms, which in turn would stifle freedom of speech.\n\nMr. Wyden said last week that KOSA's improvement had been \"insufficient\" in addressing his concern that a future administration could use the bill to censor LGBT information online.\n\nMr. Schumer, though, hailed the bills as a \"groundbreaking step toward ensuring our kids' online safety.\"\n\n\"It's not an exaggeration to say these bills will be the most important updates in decades to federal laws that protect kids on the internet. And it's a very good first step,\" he said last week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has stated his support for the legislative effort. Last Thursday, the White House said the bills would \"finally advance bold actions to hold Big Tech accountable\" and urged Congress to send them to the president's desk \"without delay.\"\n\nJust three days before that, the Biden administration's new inter-agency task force on the same subject issued its first report, with recommendations for families, the tech industry, and policymakers for young people's safety and health.\n\nAlthough the report doesn't name any bills, it recommends \"enacting bipartisan federal legislation to protect youth health, safety, and privacy online.\" A key recommendation for families is creating a family media plan, including setting screen-free zones and times and discussing social media experiences.\n\nAbout 95 percent of teenagers and 40 percent of children between 8 and 12 years of age use some form of social media, according to the report.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory last year warning that excessive use of social media might lead to anxiety and depression. In June, he called for a warning label on social media platforms similar to the warning on tobacco products.\n\nThree of four voters support the social media warning label, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on June 26. If enacted, KOSA would authorize the warning Dr. Murthy proposed.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee still needs to advance the bills in the lower chamber.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com",

This \"duty of care\" would apply to large internet companies, like social media platforms, gaming networks and streaming services.\n\nUnder KOSA, platforms can be held legally accountable if they don't prove they're doing enough to protect minors from a long list of harms, including sexual exploitation, eating disorders, suicide, substances abuse and advertisements for age-restricted products like tobacco or gambling. These companies would have to disclose when and how they're using personalized content recommendation algorithms, and give minors the option to opt out of data collection. On minors' accounts, these companies would have to limit addictive features like autoplay, or ones that gamify engagement.\n\nDespite its noble intentions to protect children, critics have expressed worries that the bill could be misused to enact surveillance and censorship. In order for platforms to determine which users are minors, they would have to use some sort of age verification system.\n\nAmong privacy advocates, age verification is frowned upon because it limits the ability to use the internet anonymously, which could endanger whistleblowers, human rights activists and people trying to flee dangerous situations, like victims of domestic abuse. These identity verification platforms could be vulnerable to hackers. Au10tix - a service used by X, TikTok, and Uber - left administrative credentials exposed online for over a year, which could have allowed cybercriminals to access people's drivers' licenses and social security numbers.\n\n\"Collecting ID online is fundamentally different - and more dangerous - than in-person ID checks in the physical world. Online ID checks are not just a momentary display - they require adults to upload data-rich, government-issued identifying documents to either the website or a third-party verifier, and create a potentially lasting record of their visit to the establishment,\" said India McKinney, Director of Federal Affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a statement.\n\nSince KOSA was introduced in 2022, some human rights groups have been worried about the potential for the bill to be weaponized against LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nIn a previous version of KOSA, activists pushed back against a part of the bill that would give individual state attorneys general the ability to decide what online content is appropriate for minors to access. This ability could potentially be weaponized against marginalized kids in a time when LGBTQ+ rights are already being attacked on the state level. As of a February edit to KOSA, the bill now gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the right to enforce the legislation. While some LGBTQ+ activist groups like the Trevor Project and GLAAD backed down after these changes, some advocates remain concerned.\n\n\"Under a potential Trump administration, the FTC could easily use KOSA to target content related to gender affirming care, abortion, racial justice, climate change, or anything else that Project 2025 infused agency is willing to claim makes kids 'depressed' or 'anxious,'\" said Evan Greer, Director of Fight for the Future.\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who introduced the bill alongside Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), has dismissed these concerns.\n\nJamie Susskind, Senator Blackburn's legislative director, said in a statement, \"KOSA will not - nor was it designed to - target or censor any individual or community.\"\n\nNot all legislators are convinced, though. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) explained in a statement why he does not support KOSA.\n\n\"Unfortunately, KOSA's improvements, while constructive, remain insufficient,\" he said. \"I fear this bill could be used to sue services that offer privacy-enhancing technologies like encryption or anonymity features that are essential to young people's ability to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by predators online. I also take seriously concerns voiced by the American Civil Liberties Union, Fight for the Future, and LGBTQ+ teens and advocates that a future MAGA administration could still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans and reproductive health information.\"\n\nAmong tech companies, KOSA has picked up steam. Microsoft, X and Snap all came out in support of the bill, even though the requirements may be challenging for the companies to meet.\n\nKOSA would have to pass in both the Senate and the House of Representatives before it heads to President Joe Biden's desk, who has indicated that he supports the bill and would sign it into law. But the bill has bounced between Senate and House with amendments, and now returns to the latter in its current form (to likely opposition, or potentially amendment and another return to the Senate).\n\n\"With vocal opposition from the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, House leadership, and even the youngest member of the House, Maxwell Frost, KOSA currently has no path to becoming law,\" Greer said.\n\nBut even if the House and Executive act swiftly to turn the bill into law, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has maintained that the Kids Online Safety Act is unconstitutional.\n\n\"It's an unconstitutional censorship bill that would give the Federal Trade Commission, and potentially state Attorneys General, the power to restrict protected online speech they find objectionable,\" said McKinney. That means KOSA would likely face legal challenges from day one.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_silberling@techcrunch.com", "name": "Amanda Silberling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault_d70b6d.jpg?resize=1200,675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

He urged the House to pass the bills quickly, noting the urgent need for these protections.\n\nKOSA has been a focal point for parent advocates, many of whom have lobbied tirelessly for the bill by meeting with lawmakers and attending hearings with tech CEOs, often sharing personal stories of loss due to cyberbullying and other online harms. This bill seeks to create a duty of care for online platforms frequented by minors, mandating they take reasonable measures to mitigate risks like online bullying, sexual exploitation, drug promotion, and eating disorders. Importantly, the bill ensures minors can still access supportive resources and information.\n\nDespite strong support, KOSA has faced opposition from digital rights, free speech, and some LGBTQ+ advocates. Critics argued the bill could lead to over-filtering of content and infringe on free expression.\n\nA coalition, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), expressed concerns that platforms might implement aggressive content filtering to avoid liability, potentially blocking important educational and lifesaving content. They also fear mandatory age verification systems could raise additional privacy issues.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the bill was amended, leading some organizations like GLAAD and the Trevor Project to withdraw their opposition. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a lead sponsor, emphasized that the bill is not about censorship but about creating a safer online environment through better product design. He likened KOSA to past consumer protection efforts targeting harmful products.\n\nKOSA includes several safeguards for children online, such as preventing unknown adults from contacting minors, restricting geolocation data sharing, and allowing minors to opt out of personalized recommendations. Platforms would also need to default to strict privacy settings for minors and provide parental control tools.\n\nCOPPA 2.0, an update to the 1998 children's privacy law, extends protections to minors under 17 and bans targeted advertising to this age group. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), who sponsored the original COPPA, stated that the law needs updating to address the evolving online landscape.\n\nOpposition remains among some senators, with concerns about potential censorship and unintended consequences. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) warned that despite improvements, the bill could still be misused to censor essential information. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) echoed these concerns.\n\nThe bills now move to the House, which faces a tight deadline before the August recess. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) expressed a commitment to reviewing the legislation and finding consensus. However, passing significant policy changes may become more challenging as the presidential election approaches.\n\nIf enacted, KOSA may face legal challenges, particularly from tech industry groups like NetChoice, which have successfully argued against similar laws on First Amendment grounds. The recent Supreme Court ruling affirming content moderation as a protected form of expression adds another layer of complexity to the bill's future.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duty of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Frontier Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trevor_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trevor Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GLAAD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Markey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Markey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/US-Senate-Passes-Landmark-Child-Online-Safety-Bills-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"With studies showing that kids today spend more time on social media than ever before, now is the moment to pass KOSA, pass COPPA, and instill guardrails that protect kids from these risks.\"\n\nBut Oregan Democrat Ron Wyden posted on X that the tweaks to KOSA \"remain insufficient\" and voiced

The Senate keeps its promise to every parent who has lost a child because of the risks of social media,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement in a politically divided Congress on curbing the negative impacts of social media, there has never been a united path on how to go about doing so.\n\nThe legislation was drawn up in consultation with parents of teens who had been bullied or sexually exploited but has been opposed by some free speech groups worried it could lead to censorship.\n\n- 'Duty of care' -\n\nHouse members are on their summer recess and will almost certainly be focusing on averting a looming government shutdown when they return in September.\n\nBut Schumer called on the lower chamber to pass the bills immediately on its return, urging lawmakers to \"seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk.\"\n\nKOSA would establish a \"duty of care\" obligation on the online platforms that would demand special provisions be put in place to shield minors from toxic content.\n\nSupported by Microsoft, X and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, the legislation would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content -- including sexual exploitation, online bullying, the promotion of suicide and eating disorders.\n\nMore from this section Solar storms could cause more auroras on Tuesday night US to help Amazon nations fight illicit finance, Yellen says Chihuahua becomes local celebrity after riding in taxi driver's car\n\nIn January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a public apology to the families of victims at the Senate Judiciary Committee as hostile lawmakers grilled tech CEOs over the dangers that children face on social media.\n\n\"I'm sorry for everything you have all been through,\" he said. \"No one should go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\n\n- Censorship fears -\n\nSeven LGBTQ advocacy groups initially opposed to the bill changed their position after changes they said mitigated concerns that teens would be limited in accessing information about gender identity, sexuality and reproductive health.\n\nBut free speech groups including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have argued the definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship.\n\n\"KOSA compounds nationwide attacks on young peoples' right to learn and access information, on and offline,\" said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU.\n\nEvan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, told reporters that KOSA was \"a blank check for censorship of any piece of content that an administration could claim is harmful to kids.\"\n\nCOPPA 2.0 would beef up legislation passed in 1998, in the earlier days of the internet.\n\nIt would require privacy standards for Americans aged under 17 and outlaw online advertising targeted at children and teens -- requiring companies to allow users to delete personal information.\n\n\"Too many kids experience relentless promotion of suicide or substance abuse material. Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"With studies showing that kids today spend more time on social media than ever before, now is the moment to pass KOSA, pass COPPA, and instill guardrails that protect kids from these risks.\"\n\nft/des", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) voted against the bills.\n\nIn a floor speech before the final vote, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a lead sponsor of KOSA, said the bill does not bock content but creates an environment for young users that is \"safe by design.\"\n\n\"At its core this bill is a product design bill,\" Blumenthal said, likening it to requirements for seatbelts and airbags in cars, or choking warnings on toys with small parts.\n\n\"This society steps forward to make products safer, putting people and particularly children over product and that is what we are requiring social media to do,\" he added.\n\nThe Senate's passage of the bills followed years of pressure from children's online safety advocates to regulate social media's impact on youth mental health and its potentially addictive features.\n\nThe pressure led to a series of hearings, including ones featuring the CEOs of tech companies, as advocates pressured Congress to put regulations in place.\n\nKOSA creates a duty of care for social media platforms to prevent and mitigate harm to minors, such as content promoting self-harm, suicide, eating disorders and substance abuse. COPPA 2.0 would add data privacy measures including the ban of targeted advertising to teens and kids online.\n\nChildren's online safety advocates, including parent advocates who lost their children to cyberbullying and other online harms, cheered the Senate vote on Tuesday. But the bills still need to pass in the House and the timeline for legislative action is dwindling, especially ahead of a contentious election.\n\nA House version of KOSA was scheduled for an Energy and Commerce Committee markup in June, but the markup was pulled after pushback from GOP leader to a separate bill, the American Privacy Rights Act, that the panel was also scheduled to consider.\n\nThe House last week went into an early August recess and is scheduled to return in early September.\n\nKOSA still faces some opposition, largely from groups funded by or with ties to tech companies that would be regulated by the legislation.\n\nSome LGBTQ+ organizations had initially pushed back on the bill over concerns that duty of care could be interpreted, especially by state attorneys general, in a way that limited teens from accessing information about sexuality, reproductive health and gender identity. Seven LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, including GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, dropped their opposition in February after updates to the bill's text.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_klar@thehill.com", "name": "Rebecca Klar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duty of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAAD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GLAAD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Targeted advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Energy_and_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/kids_online_safety_act_01312024_AP_AP24031804520264.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Richard Blumenthal, who co-wrote the legislation, told The New York Times.\n\nIf passed through the House, KOSA would require social media platforms to exercise \"duty of care\" - taking steps to prevent online harm, which includes bullying, violence, the promotion of suicide, eating disorders, drug deals and sexual exploitation.\n\nSocial media platforms would be required to protect minors' information, as well as disable addictive features and personalized algorithms on children's accounts.\n\nThe bill would require companies to restrict other users' interactions with minors on social media.\n\nThe second measure includes an update to child privacy laws that prohibits online companies from collecting personal information from users under 13, and raises that age to 17. It would also ban targeted advertising toward teens and allow teens' personal information to be deleted.\n\nBlumenthal - who co-wrote KOSA with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) - said the bill is for parents and children \"to say to big tech, we no longer trust you to make decisions for us.\"\n\nParents of children who died by suicide after being bullied online have been pushing for the Senate to vote on the protective legislation.\n\nSome parents watched the vote on Tuesday from the gallery above.\n\nJulianna Arnold of New York was in the audience. She lost her 17-year-old daughter Lucienne Konar, known as Coco, to fentanyl poisoning after an Instagram dealer sold her counterfeit Percocet laced with the drug.\n\n\"It makes you feel like you have a purpose after all of this horror,\" Arnold told The New York Times. \"It feels good to be doing something good and taking something so dark and bringing light to it.\"\n\nSocial media dangers are rampant -- 80% of parents say their kids have experienced some form of online harm, ranging from illicit content to harassment, according to online safety expert Verifymy.\n\n\"The level of harmful and illegal content online today is unacceptable,\" Verifymy COO Andy Lulham said in a statement. \"Parents are rightly worried and are doing everything they can to educate and protect their kids as they interact online.\"\n\nThe House is expected to pick up the bill in September. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) previously said he would look at the bill and try to find consensus.\n\nIn a surprising twist, tech giants Snap, X and Microsoft have all spoken in support of the legislation.\n\nSnap praised the bill and said \"the safety and well-being of young people on Snapchat is a top priority\" in a statement last week.\n\nMeanwhile, the social media platform - which allows users to send photos that disappear after a seconds-long timer runs out - is known for frequent child luring and sextortion schemes.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has not taken a clear stance on the legislation.\n\nWhen asked about an older version of the bill earlier this year on Capitol Hill, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the company could support it with some changes.\n\nSupporters of the bill, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), were aiming for a unanimous vote, which would fast-track the process. The speedy legislative path would allow the Senate, which is running short on floor time ahead of the upcoming 2024 election, to avoid a lengthier roll call vote.\n\nWhile not unanimous, supporters were hoping for a strong vote, which might push the House to act faster. An 86-1 test vote last week hinted at the landslide vote on Tuesday.\n\n\"Getting to this point wasn't easy, that's for sure. It has been a long and winding and difficult road,\" Schumer said in a statement on Monday. \"But after tomorrow, I am very proud that it will all have been worth it.\"\n\nSchumer took some heat earlier this month for slowing down the bill's progress when he promised - and failed - to schedule a floor vote by June 20, despite the legislation's widespread support.\n\nSchumer's slowdown is not the only obstacle in the bill's path.\n\nKOSA - written by Blumenthal and Blackburn - strives to strike a balance between social media restrictions and the protection of free speech.\n\nSome critics have worried that vulnerable children would not be able to access important information on LGBTQ issues or reproductive rights as easily, so the bill was revised to address these concerns and keep this access protected.\n\nBut some members of Congress have argued the legislation still poses too much of a threat to the First Amendment.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) previously said KOSA's definition of \"mental health disorder\" is too broad and could shift over time.\n\n\"They've already got moms who've had tragedies with their kids coming up to me, but someone has to have the guts to read the bill, see what's wrong with it,\" Paul told the Huffington Post last month. \"If they want it unanimously, they have to negotiate.\"\n\nRon Wyden (D-Ore.) has reportedly sought assurances that KOSA would not weaken Section 230, a controversial statute he co-authored that protects online services from being liable for third-party content generated by its users, sources said.\n\n\"There have been productive discussions on KOSA,\" a Wyden aide said. \"It's moving in the right direction. He has not yet lifted his hold.\"\n\nMeanwhile, parents of children who committed suicide due to the dangers of social media have been pushing for the bill to pass through the Senate.\n\nTheir calls grew louder after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered a surprise apology to the families of victims of online child sex abuse during a Senate hearing on Capitol Hill.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

Reporters at the Capitol want more cameras in the Senate to cover the impeachment trial and fewer restrictions to talk to senators when they are not sitting in judgment of the president. (Senate Television via AP, File)\n\nThe Senate passed a legislative package on Tuesday that would shield underage social media users from harmful content and bar platforms from harvesting minors' personal user data for advertising.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) both passed the Senate in a 91-3 vote. 47 Republicans, 47 Democrats and three independents united to pass the package, with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah voting against the bills.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts first introduced COPPA in 1998 when he was a House member, has since reintroduced the bill over two decades later in order to \"evolve\" and \"meet the reality of today's digital landscape\" and is cosponsored by Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, along with over a dozen other lawmakers. The revamped KOSA legislation was introduced by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, with Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee as a cosponsor, among others.\n\nA revised COPPA would ban targeted advertising towards minors and prohibit the collection of personal data from underage users, according to a press release. The bill would also create an \"eraser button,\" which allows children to delete their personal information from the platform.\n\n\"Big Tech is knowingly fueling a mental health crisis in this country by exploiting kids and teens just so they can make more money. It's Congress's job to stand up for young people and put an end to this,\" Markey said in a press release. \"I am proud of the protections guaranteed by my 1998 law, COPPA, but the fact remains that today's online guardrails were written before the invention of the iPhone. The law has to evolve to meet the reality of today's digital landscape. We won't address the threats to young people if we don't stop the data practices at the root of the problem.\"\n\nBlumenthal introduced KOSA in May of 2023, which requires social media platforms to provide minors with safeguards that restrict access to their personal data and provides parents with tools to moderate their child's platform usage, according to the bill summary.\n\n\"The bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which is supported by over half of the U.S. Senate, provides young people and parents with the tools, safeguards, and transparency they need to protect against online harms,\" Blumenthal said in a press release. \"The bill requires social media platforms to put the well-being of children first by providing an environment that is safe by default.\"\n\nBlumenthal's legislation has drawn the ire of some senators who cite concerns regarding freedom of speech and government overreach.\n\nThe bill would allow a state attorney general to take action if they have a \"reason to believe that an interest of residents of the State has been or is threatened or adversely affected by the engagement\" with social media content, according to the bill text.\n\n\"This is insane,\" Paul said during a floor speech on July 25. \"This bill is not well thought out, this bill is Pandora's box for censorship. In truth, this bill opens the door to nearly limitless content regulation.\"\n\nPaul described a \"self-policing effect\" that could take place as a result of these new regulations and standards.\n\n\"This bill does not merely regulate the internet, it threatens to stifle important and diverse discussions that are essential to a free society,\" Paul said during the floor speech.\n\nOther Senators maintain that the bill is not susceptible to bias from attorneys general. Blumenthal insists that there are safeguards in place to prevent content censorship or first amendment violations.\n\n\"The Kids Online Safety Act does not give state Attorneys General or FTC the power to bring lawsuits over content or speech,\" Blumenthal said in a press release. \"The Kids Online Safety Act would not censor, block, or remove any content from the internet. The Kids Online Safety Act targets the harms that online platforms cause through their own product and business decisions - like how they design their products and applications to keep kids online for as long as possible, train their algorithms to exploit vulnerabilities, and target children with advertising.\"\n\nA source familiar with the bill, who is not authorized to speak publicly, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that there will be a standard of enforcement to ensure bias is not an issue.\n\n\"The updated draft also rests enforcement of the duty of care on the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that there is a uniform standard in the enforcement of the provision, rather than differing interpretations for each state,\" the source close to the issue told the DCNF.\n\nThis legislation also faced scrutiny from some LGBTQ groups who shared Paul's concerns about censorship. A coalition of over 90 LGBTQ groups sent a letter to Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in November of 2022 expressing their opposition to the bill.\n\n\"Online services would face substantial pressure to over-moderate, including from state Attorneys General seeking to make political points about what kind of information is appropriate for young people,\" the letter reads. \"At a time when books with LGBTQ+ themes are being banned from school libraries and people providing healthcare to trans children are being falsely accused of 'grooming,' KOSA would cut off another vital avenue of access to information for vulnerable youth.\"\n\nThe bill has received an onslaught of support from conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation and America First Policy Institute.\n\n\"Under current law, social media platforms evade compliance by writing in their policy that users under age 13 are prohibited from using their services, however they do very little to enforce the policy,\" the Heritage Foundation said in a press release. \"Nearly 70% of children under age 13 use social media. COPPA 2.0 better protects America's children by increasing the age of those covered by the law's protections to 16 and puts social media platforms on the hook for compliance.\"", "source": {"uri":

The House has just begun its six-week summer recess and won't return to Washington until Sept. 9. And while he's supportive of the \"purpose\" of the bills, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he's still reviewing the legislation and hasn't scheduled a vote.\n\nThe two bills -- known as the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, and the Children's and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA 2.0 -- represent the most significant congressional action in decades to regulate social media's impact on children and teens.\n\n\"This is why we came here -- to get things done and do it in a bipartisan way that literally will save lives,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a former state attorney general, who teamed with Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., on authoring KOSA, said in an interview last week.\n\n\"What we're doing is giving parents and kids the tools to disconnect from harmful content, bullying, eating disorders, stuff that really hurts them, and also impose a duty of care on Big Tech that for too long, has said 'trust us' and betrayed that trust,\" Blumenthal continued. \"And now, they're going to have to comply with a law that imposes a duty on them to mitigate or prevent harm.\"\n\nKOSA, written by Blumenthal and Blackburn, would require social media companies to provide better protections for users under age 17. It also would require companies to provide guardians with more control over minors' use of a platform and prevent certain features, such as autoplay. And it would require companies to give users a dedicated page to report harmful content.\n\nCOPPA 2.0, written by Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., would create stronger online privacy protections for anyone under age 17. It would also bar targeted advertising to kids and teens and create an eraser button for parents and kids by requiring companies to allow users to delete information.\n\nSome tech companies, like Microsoft and Snap, the company that owns Snapchat, have endorsed KOSA. Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, offered suggestions on how to improve the bill, while some other social media companies have not taken a formal position.\n\n\"We support the development of age-appropriate standards for teens online, and appreciate KOSA's attempt to create a consistent set of rules for the industry to follow,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"However, we think there's a better way to help parents oversee their teens' online experiences: federal legislation should require app stores to get parents' approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps.\"\n\nOpponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union and other free speech and civil liberties groups, argue that the bill's definition of harm is too broad and that it could lead to censorship of content that promotes politically polarizing issues, gender equality or abortion rights.\n\nBut in recent months, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., worked closely with Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and the bills' sponsors -- Blumenthal, Blackburn, Markey and Cassidy -- to address concerns and build support.\n\n\"Today, after a lot of hard work and a lot of twists and turns, we will pass KOSA and COPPA,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Tuesday before the vote. \"KOSA and COPPA will be perhaps the most important updates to federal laws protecting kids on the internet in decades. And it's a very good first step.\"\n\nThe leader said social media has benefits but also significant risks for children's safety. He called on the House to quickly take up the online safety package when the chamber returns in September.\n\n\"These bills have real bipartisan momentum, so we should seize the opportunity to send them to the president's desk,\" Schumer said.\n\nBut the Republican-led House is looking to put its own mark on the legislation. Before the recess, Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, D-Wash., said her full committee is \"planning to move forward\" with marking up both bills -- a process that could include changes to the bills that would need to pass the full House and then the Senate again before becoming law.\n\n\"It's very important that Congress act,\" McMorris Rodgers, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year, said in an interview.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson appeared bullish about passing the bills through the House before this Congress ends in January.\n\n\"We're looking at details of it. Obviously, I believe in the purpose of the legislation. I think it's really important,\" the speaker said. \"But there's a couple of questions we have about the details, but I think we can work it out and I'd like to get it done.\"\n\nKOSA was drafted following a series of emotional and powerful hearings focused on the harms of social media on young people. Parents testified about how social media had driven their children to commit suicide or led to other harm. And senators demanded social media executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, apologize to the parents in the room as they held photos of their deceased loved ones.\n\nThese parents made the case \"that our children are not a product that can be exploited by these social media companies,\" Blackburn said in a joint interview with Blumenthal. \"As we did hearings, they stepped forward, they told their stories. They came to us and they said, 'Let us be a part of this. Let us help.'\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Both laws seek to control how much data can be collected from minors, as well as regulate the platform features that could harm children's mental health.\n\nOnly Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah) opposed the bills.\n\nIn an op-ed for The Courier-Journal, Paul argued that KOSA imposes a \"duty of care\" to mitigate harms to minors on their platforms that \"will not only stifle free speech, but it will deprive Americans of the benefits of our technological advancements.\"\n\n\"With the Internet, today's children have the world at their fingertips,\" Paul wrote, but if KOSA passes, even allegedly benign content like \"pro-life messages\" or discussion of a teen overcoming an eating disorder could be censored if platforms fear compliance issues.\n\n\"While doctors' and therapists' offices close at night and on weekends, support groups are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for people who share similar concerns or have the same health problems. Any solution to protect kids online must ensure the positive aspects of the Internet are preserved,\" Paul wrote.\n\nDuring a KOSA critics' press conference today, Dara Adkison -- the executive director of a group providing resources for transgender youths called TransOhio -- expressed concerns that lawmakers would target sites like TransOhio if the law also passed in the House, where the bill heads next.\n\n\"I've literally had legislators tell me to my face that they would love to see our website taken off the Internet because they don't want people to have the kinds of vital community resources that we provide,\" Adkison said.\n\nPaul argued that what was considered harmful to kids was subjective, noting that a key flaw with KOSA was that \"KOSA does not explicitly define the term 'mental health disorder.'\" Instead, platforms are to refer to the definition in \"the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders\" or \"the most current successor edition.\"\n\n\"That means the scope of the bill could change overnight without any action from America's elected representatives,\" Paul warned, suggesting that \"KOSA opens the door to nearly limitless content regulation because platforms will censor users rather than risk liability.\"\n\nAhead of the vote, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) -- who co-sponsored KOSA -- denied that the bill strove to regulate content, The Hill reported. To Blumenthal and other KOSA supporters, its aim instead is to ensure that social media is \"safe by design\" for young users.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, KOSA and COPPA 2.0 passing \"represent the most significant restrictions on tech platforms to clear a chamber of Congress in decades.\" However, while President Joe Biden has indicated he would be willing to sign the bill into law, most seem to agree that KOSA will struggle to pass in the House of Representatives.\n\nA senior tech policy director for Chamber of Progress -- a progressive tech industry policy coalition -- Todd O'Boyle, has said that currently there is \"substantial opposition\" in the House. O'Boyle said that he expects that the political divide will be enough to block KOSA's passage and prevent giving \"the power\" to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or \"the next president\" to \"crack down on online speech\" or otherwise pose \"a massive threat to our constitutional rights.\"\n\n\"If there's one thing the far-left and far-right agree on, it's that the next chair of the FTC shouldn't get to decide what online posts are harmful,\" O'Boyle said.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_belanger@arstechnica.com", "name": "Ashley Belanger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosa_(Maoist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kosa (Maoist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Progress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chamber of Progress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-909597732-760x380.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

KOSA also requires platforms to limit features that result in compulsive usage -- like autoplay and infinite scroll -- or features that allow adults to contact young users or track their location. The bill says platforms must notify parents if their kids are exposed to potentially hazardous materials or interactions.\n\nConnect with the issues and events that impact your community at home and beyond by subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nCOPPA 2.0, crafted by Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), aims to establish robust online privacy protections for minors under 17. Among its provisions, the legislation would prohibit targeted advertising directed at children and teenagers and introduce an \"eraser button,\" enabling parents and kids to delete personal information from company databases.\n\nKOSA is supported by groups like Common Sense Media, Fairplay, Design It For Us, Accountable Tech, Eating Disorders Coalition, American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Many other groups oppose the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Woodhull Freedom Foundation, the LGBT Technology Partnership, Fight for the Future, as well as LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations in six states.\n\nBecause KOSA makes social media platforms legally liable for suggesting content that may harm kids' mental health, the aforementioned opposition groups worry that Republican attorneys general who see LGBTQ+ identities as harmful forms of mental illness will use KOSA to censor queer web content and prosecute platforms that provide access it. To avoid lawsuits, social media platforms may just censor such content altogether.\n\nFurthermore, opposition groups say the law violates the First Amendment because it dictates what speech private companies can and cannot promote.\n\nSupporters of KOSA point out that the legislation explicitly states that social media companies must only suppress content that encourages suicidal behaviors, eating disorders, substance use, sexual exploitation, and ads for tobacco and alcohol. The legislation allows social users of all ages to access any material that they deliberately search for, and the legislation excludes many organizational websites from possible lawsuits, including government platforms, libraries, and non-profits.\n\nWyden specifically said he voted against the bills because he worried a future administration could use the legislation to \"pressure companies to censor gay, trans, and reproductive health information,\" The Hill reported.\n\nLee said, \"This legislation empowers the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)] to censor any content it deems to cause 'harm,' 'anxiety,' or 'depression,' in a way that could (and most likely would) be used to censor the expression of political, religious, and other viewpoints disfavored by the FTC.\"\n\nPaul wrote in a recent Louisville Courier Journal opinion article, \"KOSA would impose an unprecedented duty of care on internet platforms to design their sites to mitigate and prevent harms.... This requirement will not only stifle free speech, but it will deprive Americans of the benefits of our technological advancements.\"\n\nKOSA was introduced by anti-LGBTQ+ Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who said that one of the bill's top priorities is to protect children from \"the transgender in this culture.\" Blackburn's office told LGBTQ Nation that her comment had been \"taken out of context\" and wasn't related to KOSA. Nevertheless, the anti-LGBTQ+ conservative think tank Heritage Foundation has also said it wishes to use the law to \"guard\" kids against the \"harms of... transgender content.\"\n\nWhile the Senate voted on KOSA, opposition groups issued statements against its passage.\n\nJoe Mullin, Senior Policy Analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said, \"I think some of this is just based on hoping or believing that the enforcement of a speech law will be done by the good guys. And that's we've just never seen that be the case. And that's why it's better to stick by our First Amendment values.\"\n\nMandy Salley, Chief Operating Officer at Woodhull Freedom Foundation, said, \"I'm really particularly concerned about the impact on youth in states that are already living under abortion bans or living in the 25 States that have bans on gender and care. I think you're just gonna see that kind of censorship get much worse.\"\n\nDara Adkison, Executive Director of TransOhio, said, \"I've literally had legislators tell me to my face that they would love to see our website taken off the Internet because they don't want people to have the kinds of vital community resources that we provide.\"\n\nJenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said, \"KOSA compounds nationwide attacks on young peoples' right to learn and access information, on and offline. As state legislatures and school boards across the country impose book bans and classroom censorship laws, the last thing students and parents need is another act of government censorship deciding which educational resources are appropriate for their families. The House must block this dangerous bill before it's too late.\"", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LGBTQ Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_villarreal@lgbtqnation.com", "name": "Daniel Villarreal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodhull_Freedom_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woodhull Freedom Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_Media", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common Sense Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Targeted advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Markey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ed Markey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_Nation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBTQ Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://abuwjaawap.cloudimg.io/v7/_lgbtqnation-assets_/assets/2024/07/kosa-children-lgbtq-youth.jpg?auto=format&auto=compress&fit=crop&gravity=smart&w=1200&h=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) voted against the bills.\n\nIn a floor speech before the final vote, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a lead sponsor of KOSA, said the bill does not block content but creates an environment for young users that is \"safe by design.\"\n\n\"At its core this bill is a product design bill,\" Blumenthal said, likening it to requirements for seat belts and airbags in cars, or choking warnings on toys with small parts.\n\n\"This society steps forward to make products safer, putting people and particularly children over product, and that is what we are requiring social media to do,\" he added.\n\nThe Senate's passage of the bills followed years of pressure from children's online safety advocates to regulate social media's impact on youth mental health and its potentially addictive features.\n\nThe pressure led to a series of hearings, including ones featuring the CEOs of tech companies, as advocates pressured Congress to put regulations in place.\n\nKOSA creates a duty of care for social media platforms to prevent and mitigate harm to minors, such as that caused by content promoting self-harm, suicide, eating disorders and substance abuse. COPPA 2.0 would add data privacy measures including the ban of targeted advertising to teens and kids online.\n\nChildren's online safety advocates, including parent advocates who lost their children to cyberbullying and other online harms, cheered the Senate vote on Tuesday. But the bills still need to pass in the House, and the timeline for legislative action is dwindling, especially ahead of a contentious election.\n\nPresident Biden issued a statement in support of the bill after it passed and urged the House to send it to his desk to sign \"without delay.\" He underscored the need for regulations given the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\"The last time Congress took meaningful action to protect children and teenagers online was in 1998 - before the ubiquity of social media and smartphones. Our kids have been waiting too long for the safety and privacy protections they deserve and which this bill would provide. This is more important than ever with the growing use of AI,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nKOSA still faces some opposition, mainly centered on concerns some tech industry groups and advocacy groups raised that the bill would pose issues of censorship online or limit minors from accessing information about sensitive topics, including about gender identity or reproductive health.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_klar@thehill.com", "name": "Rebecca Klar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "julia_shapero@thehill.com", "name": "Julia Shapero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duty of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Targeted advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Information_and_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Information and Advice", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/cropped-favicon-512px-1.png?w=240", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

While I deeply sympathize with the families of those who have tragically lost loved ones to suicide, and I have no doubt the authors of the Kids Online Safety Act genuinely want to protect children, KOSA is not the solution\n\nKOSA would impose an unprecedented duty of care on internet platforms to design their sites to mitigate and prevent harms associated with mental health, such as anxiety, depression and eating disorders. This requirement will not only stifle free speech, but it will deprive Americans of the benefits of our technological advancements.\n\nWith the internet, today's children have the world at their fingertips. While doctors' and therapists' offices close at night and on weekends, support groups are available 24 hours a day seven days a week for people who share similar concerns or have the same health problems. Any solution to protect kids online must ensure the positive aspects of the internet are preserved.\n\nKOSA only leads to silencing free speech\n\nKOSA supporters will tell you that they have no desire to regulate content. But the requirement that platforms mitigate undefined harms belies the bill's effect to regulate online content. Imposing a \"duty of care\" on online platforms to mitigate harms associated with mental health can only lead to one outcome: The silencing of constitutionally protected speech.\n\nThe bill empowers the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the duty of care requirement to prevent mental health disorders, yet KOSA does not explicitly define the term \"mental health disorder.\" Instead, it references the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders . . . or \"the most current successor edition.\" That mean the scope of the bill could change overnight without any action from America's elected representatives.\n\nKids Online Safety Act: It's a massive government overreach that infringes parental autonomy\n\nAdditionally, KOSA supporters say they have no desire to regulate content. But the requirement that platforms mitigate undefined harms belies the bill's effect to regulate content.\n\nFor example, if a platform uses an endless scroll to promote Shakespeare's works, or algebra problems, or the history of the Roman Empire, would anyone consider that harmful? I doubt it, because website design does not cause harm. KOSA will inevitably regulate content.\n\nHow would platforms comply with KOSA's requirement to mitigate and prevent undefined harms such as anxiety, depression, and eating disorders? Should platforms stop children from seeing war coverage because it could lead to depression? Should pro-life messages be censored because platforms worry it could impact the mental well-being of teenage mothers? Would sites permit discussion of a teenager overcoming an eating disorder?\n\nKOSA opens the door to nearly limitless content regulation\n\nThe world's most well-known climate activist, Greta Thunberg, famously suffers from climate anxiety. Would KOSA deprive the next Greta Thunberg from engaging in online climate activism?\n\nKOSA opens the door to nearly limitless content regulation because platforms will censor users rather than risk liability. Financial concerns may cause online forums to eliminate anxiety-inducing content for all users, regardless of age, if the expense of policing teenage users is prohibitive.\n\nThis bill does not merely regulate the internet; it threatens to suppress important and diverse discussions that are essential to a free and healthy society.

The package cleared the upper chamber 91-3 and now heads to the House, which is on a six-week summer break until September.\n\nKOSA would require online platforms, including social media and gaming sites, to establish a legal obligation known as a \"duty of care\" to take reasonable protections against potentially harmful content for children and teenagers. That content includes the promotion of illegal products, eating disorders, tobacco or alcohol, substance abuse, bullying, and sexual abuse.\n\nCOPPA would also ban certain ads targeted at children and bars tech companies from collecting personal information of minors.\n\nIndustry opponents warn more data collection may be required in order to verify the ages of users while others cite concern over free speech. The Federal Trade Commission would oversee enforcement of the laws.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urged the GOP-led House to pass the legislation as soon as it returns.\n\n\"As we all know, social media has many benefits. But we also know about the many risks social media can pose, especially to our kids,\" Schumer said. \"Too many kids experience relentless promotion of suicide or substance abuse material. Too many kids have their personal data collected and then used nefariously.\"\n\nCongress has not passed online protections for minors since 1998. KOSA was spearheaded by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who first introduced it in 2022 and have altered it over the years to its current form. The revision of COPPA was led by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Ed Markey (D-MA).\n\nThe bipartisan win marked a departure from the messaging votes on contentious issues, such as immigration and abortion, that Schumer has largely focused on in recent months as Senate Democrats fight this November to keep their one-seat majority.\n\nThose who voted against the bills were Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (R-OR).\n\nWyden said positive changes were made to KOSA to alleviate concerns from LGBTQ+ advocates of censoring content and that the current version was \"less likely that the bill can be used as a tool for MAGA extremists to wage war on legal and essential information to teens.\" But he said the improvements \"remain insufficient.\"\n\n\"I fear KOSA could be used to sue services that offer privacy technologies like encryption or anonymity features that kids rely on to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by predators online,\" Wyden said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPaul feared KOSA could threaten free speech and overburden internet platforms with addressing the mental health issues of minors that are not in tech companies' control or their responsibility.\n\n\"Government mandates and censorship will not protect children online,\" Paul wrote in a USA Today op-ed. \"The internet may pose new problems, but there is an age-old solution to this issue.

But that changes with KOSA, which will finally hold them accountable.\n\nCongress has not passed a major law to protect children online since 1998. And a lot has changed in the last 25 years.\n\nBut this moment would have been impossible without the hundreds of parents -- including many who have tragically lost their children to social media harms -- who have traveled to Washington over the past several years to share their heartbreaking stories and demand action.\n\nSenator Blumenthal and I could not have accomplished this without their voices, and I want to thank all our friends and allies for their work in getting this bill on to the Senate floor.\n\nOne thing is certain: Moms on a mission have always proven to be an unstoppable force.\"\n\nBlackburn Thanks Leader Schumer, Commerce Committee Leadership, and 70 Senate Co-Sponsors\n\n\"I also want to thank Leader Schumer, Commerce Committee Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and our [70] Senate co-sponsors for helping us get here.\n\nOnce the Senate formally passes KOSA, our work is not done: We must ensure that the House quickly passes this bill and sends it to the President's desk.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cantwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Cantwell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Information_and_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Information and Advice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The House is currently on recess until September. However, big tech companies, digital rights groups, and even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have vowed to fight the bills should they pass, claiming the bills threaten online rights and free speech.\n\nThe Children and Teens' Online Privacy and Protection Act 2.0 extends protections for children under 13 to children under 16. It's an updated version of the original Children and Teens' Online Privacy and Protection Act passed in 1998.\n\nCOPPA 2.0 seeks to address increasing concerns about how tech companies handle the data of young users in light of the rising mental health issues linked to online content and data practices. Beyond extending the age of those children covered under the bill, it prohibits targeted advertising, requires parental consent before collecting data from children aged 13-16, and includes an \"eraser button\" that allows parents and teens to delete personal information. The bill would also establish a new enforcement arm known as the Youth Marketing and Privacy Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nWhile COPPA 2.0 focuses more on targeted advertising and data collection, KOSA, the Kids Online Safety Act, seeks to enhance safety measures on online platforms like Facebook and Instagram. KOSA would require platforms to implement measures that mitigate risk of harm to children, strengthen parental controls and transparency into data collection, data privacy and usage, and require platforms to conduct annual independent audits to review their safety measures. These audit reports would be publicly available.\n\nThe primary challenge to these bills comes from a tech industry trade association called NetChoice. NetChoice members include X (Twitter), Snap, Pinterest, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Google, Amazon, and Netflix.\n\nWhile proponents of the bills claim they pass constitutional muster, NetChoice sees things differently. Carl Szabo, NetChoice VP & General Counsel, states that while Congress has good intentions, the proposed legislation could have some chilling effects on parental rights and free speech.\n\nKOSA fails to meet basic constitutional principles and fails parents because it won't make a single child safer online or address their concerns. Taking away parents' and guardians' authority and choice, while forcing them to give up their and their children's personal information to access and engage in free speech, is both dangerous and a violation of their rights.\n\nThe Chamber of Progress and other pro-LGBTQ groups have raised concerns that the bills would be used to target LGBTQ content. Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, a lead co-sponsor for KOSA, said in an interview with Family Policy Alliance, a conservative Christian organization, \"protecting minor children from the transgender in this culture and that influence\" is part of the spirit behind the bills.\n\nJason Kelly, Activism Director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), expressed more direct concerns as to how the bills will be enforced and practical concerns for adults. Kelly warned: \"It would put the tools of censorship in the hands of state attorneys general, and would greatly endanger the rights, and safety, of young people online. And KOSA's burdens would affect adults, too, who will likely face hurdles to accessing legal content online as a result of the bill.\"\n\nWhile there seems to be broad agreement as to the importance of protecting minors online, there's little consensus on how to achieve it. Online content moderation and freedom of speech are necessarily complex issues. Is the goal of the government to broadly control access to information online and a direct threat to free speech? It's possible.\n\nOn the other hand, it's reasonable that federal laws preempting state laws on online safety free corporations from having to comply with a patchwork of laws. One interesting note: Senator Rand Paul, the lone vote against the bills, called them a \"Pandora's box for censorship.\" We'll keep you informed as things evolve.", "source": {"uri": "idropnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iDrop News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetChoice_v._Paxton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NetChoice v.

The dueling approaches have bogged down negotiations and delayed attempts to get any legislation over the finish line.\n\nThose disputes have thrown into doubt the fate of the proposals, which President Biden has indicated he would sign into law.\n\nSenators began crafting KOSA, the child safety measure, after conducting an investigation into 2021 disclosures by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen showing that the social media company knew its products at times worsened body image issues for some teens. The explosive revelations sparked indignation and catalyzed the legislative push on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have little to show for years of pledges to rein in the tech giants amid a litany of grievances.\n\nThe bill would create the new obligation for companies to mitigate potential harms to children, known as a \"duty of care.\" Since its introduction in 2022, a coalition of child safety advocates, youth activists and parents whose children's deaths were linked to social media have urged lawmakers to act, forming a powerful lobbying force that gave lawmakers a visceral reminder of the potential stakes.\n\n\"Nobody would blame these parents if they preferred to process their pain in privacy, curse the darkness, but instead they've shared their stories, pushed the Senate into action,\" Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said during a floor speech Thursday.\n\nMaurine Molak, whose son David died by suicide after facing intense cyberbullying online, said at a news conference in the Senate last week that Congress should pass the proposals \"because no other families should have to suffer the way we have.\"\n\nWhile KOSA has drawn broad bipartisan support in Congress, it has faced persistent opposition from tech industry and digital rights groups, who say it will chill speech online and force companies to collect even more data from users to comply with its obligations.\n\nEvan Greer, director of the liberal activist group Fight for the Future, said enforcers could use the \"duty of care\" provision to force companies to suppress content they dislike, including \"gender affirming care, abortion, racial justice, climate change, or anything else.\"\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the three lawmakers who voted against the package, said in a post on X last week that he opposes KOSA because it could \"be used as a tool for MAGA extremists to wage war on legal and essential information to teens.\" Wyden also voiced concern that it could undermine privacy features like encryption. The bill's proponents dispute the claims.\n\nSens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) also voted against the bills.\n\nThe push to expand privacy protections for children dates back decades. In 1998, Congress passed the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, a watershed law requiring that websites and other online services obtain parental consent before collecting data from kids up to 12.\n\nBut Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who led the push to pass COPPA as a member of the House in the 1990s, said he was unsuccessful then in his effort to extend those protections to teenagers, as the new bill does.\n\n\"This is the first time in 26 years that we've been able to come back and to put the protections that were needed then, and are even more needed today, on the books,\" Markey said in an interview.\n\nIf signed into law, COPPA 2.0 would widen the parental consent requirement for data collection to include information from children as old as 16. The bill would also ban companies from targeting kids and teens with advertising, a proposal Biden has vocally endorsed in his State of the Union addresses. KOSA has fomented more forceful opposition than COPPA 2.0.\n\nSchumer combined the two measures into a legislative package that the Senate began to formally consider Thursday, while eschewing other proposals to bar young kids from accessing social media altogether or to give victims of child sexual abuse a way to sue platforms for facilitating improper contacts.\n\nOdds for passage in the House this year appear dim. While Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) recently told CNBC he supports the idea behind the bills, the chair of a key committee considering the bills said House leadership has expressed concerns about the bills, without elaborating. And the chamber is only in session for just over a half dozen more weeks this year, with the election expected to sap lawmakers' attention in Washington. The House broke early for its annual August recess last week without rescheduling a markup for the bills.\n\nSpokespeople for Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesman for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), whose committee recently yanked the bills from a legislative markup in the House, said she is \"pleased to see the Senate take this step and is fully committed to working together to continue advancing these important policies.\"\n\nEven if signed into law, the legislation is likely to face legal challenges from the tech industry, which has successfully halted parallel child online safety laws at the state level. While many cases are ongoing, federal judges have repeatedly expressed free-speech concerns over states' efforts to regulate social media companies, dealing a series of blows to laws aimed at protecting kids online.\n\nNetChoice, the tech trade association that has challenged those laws, has called KOSA \"unconstitutional,\" citing injunctions they secured against states as legal precedent.\n\nChris Marchese, who leads the group's litigation center, said Friday that the bill follows the same \"model of unconstitutionality\" as a defunct California law that sought to restrict the sale of violent video games to minors. The Supreme Court struck it down in 2011, ruling 7-2 that the sales were protected under the First Amendment.\n\nNetChoice counts Google, Amazon and Meta as members, among others. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nProponents of KOSA have pushed back on those claims, arguing that the bill sidesteps thorny constitutional debates about speech online and instead seeks to bring consumer safety protections to social media, like regulations requiring seat belts in cars. Some tech companies have endorsed the bill, including Snapchat, LinkedIn-owner Microsoft and Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"This is about product design,\" Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who co-authored KOSA alongside Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), said during a news conference Thursday.\n\nNetChoice Vice President Carl Szabo said COPPA 2.0 also raises \"constitutional questions,\" but the group has not opposed that bill as forcefully as KOSA.\n\nFor Congress, Blumenthal said Thursday, action against the tech giants was long overdue.\n\n\"It is a historic moment because ... Congress is finally imposing some accountability on an industry that has gone totally non-responsible and irresponsible for decades now,\" Blumenthal said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com",

Schumer, New York Democrat said, urging the House to take up the legislation when the chamber returns in September.\n\nThe Senate-passed legislation combined the two bills, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), into one package.\n\nKOSA would require social media companies to enable the strongest privacy settings for kids by default and to disable automated algorithms and features that show addictive products.\n\nThe measure would also impose a \"duty of care\" that would allow the Federal Trade Commission to bring enforcement actions against social media companies if they continue using algorithms or other tools to push certain harmful content.\n\nOpponents argue this violates the First Amendment, but the authors of the bill said it's narrowly targeted to avoid running afoul of the Constitution.\n\n\"We're talking here about stuff that really is almost like incitement, fighting words under the constitutional standard, which don't have protection under the First Amendment: Speech that is bullying, eating disorders, suicide, self-harm encouragement, addictive in a sense through algorithms that drive content repeatedly in response to expressions of interest,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat, told The Washington Times.\n\nCOPPA would prohibit online platforms from collecting certain information from users 17 or younger, up from the current threshold age of 13.\n\nPresident Biden, who has called on Congress to pass legislation protecting children online, would sign the legislation if it passes the House.\n\n\"Congress has not taken meaningful action to protect children and teenagers online since 1998 -- before the ubiquity of social media and the invention of the smartphone,\" the Biden administration said in a statement. \"It's long past time to act to keep youth safe online and hold Big Tech accountable for the national experiment they are running on our children for profit.\"\n\nThe U.S. surgeon general and others say social media is exacerbating a youth mental health crisis.\n\nMr. Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, the lead sponsors of KOSA, said impacted families have been the driving force behind the bill.\n\n\"This moment would have been impossible without the hundreds of parents -- including many who have tragically lost their children to social media harms -- who have traveled to Washington over the past several years to share their heartbreaking stories and demand action,\" Ms. Blackburn said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill, said it is well intended but yet another example of government overreach that could limit free speech or result in other unintended consequences.\n\n\"Some people don't care whether their kid watches beer ads or gambling ads. Some people do,\" Mr. Paul told The Times, citing examples of content he believes the bill would regulate. \"These decisions really need to be left up to families.\"\n\nThe House has already adjourned for its summer recess until Sept. 9, delaying possible action on the legislation until then.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee had been scheduled to mark up its version of KOSA in late June, along with a broader measure to establish data privacy rights and enforcement mechanisms to crack down on violations of those rights. But the panel canceled the markup because of concerns from House GOP leaders about the broader privacy bill.\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rogers, who chairs the committee, said last week she is still having conversations with leadership about how best to advance the child safety bills and the broader privacy measure.\n\nRep. Erin Houchin, Indiana Republican, recently talked with Ms. McMorris Rogers about the importance of passing KOSA on her podcast, comparing social media use to other addictive behaviors.\n\n\"We have protections for kids not smoking and kids not drinking and kids not engaging in vaping and other things,\" Ms. Houchin said. \"And social media can be that detrimental to a child's mental and physical health, especially if they're staying up all night on their devices.\"\n\nMs. McMorris Rogers said social media companies say they already have ways in which parents can curtail their kids' social media use, but it's \"not a fair fight\" because many children have figured out ways around those controls. KOSA goes to the source of the issue and forces social media companies to change the way they present content to children, she said.\n\n\"My biggest fear as a parent really is around tech and social media and how much destructive activity kids are being exposed to,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We know as gamers ourselves, this is an exciting way to engage through play with the GamesBeat content you have already come to love. Start playing games here.\n\nThe United States Senate has passed two bills that could have major impacts on how large tech platforms, including games, treat minors under 16.\n\nThe two bills -- the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, referred to as COPPA 2.0. -- passed in the U.S. Senate in a bipartisan 91-3 landslide vote. If these bills are also ratified by the U.S. House of Representatives, they would represent the most significant restrictions on tech platforms in decades.\n\nKey figures in the Republican-controlled U.S. House have expressed interest in taking up these bills and passing them before end of this Congress' term in January. However, it's unclear what revisions will happen during this time.\n\nKOSA and COPPA 2.0\n\nOverall, proponents believe these two bills will protect young users and their data from bad actors and big tech platforms. On the other hand, opponents argue that these new rules require platforms to collect more user data and would impact all users, rather than just those the bill is meant to protect.\n\nKOSA requires tech platforms to safeguard minor users from harmful content and give users more control over this content and their data. This \"duty of care\" includes restricting self-harm, online bullying, sexual exploitation and predatory marketing practices.\n\nHowever, unlike previous bills aimed at protecting minors, KOSA doesn't require a platform to know if a user is a minor to impose these restrictions. Instead, users must prove they meet age requirements likely through giving personal data to the platform or a third-party verifier.\n\nMeanwhile, the original COPPA -- which initially passed in 1998 -- prohibits online services from collecting information on users under 13 without parental consent. Now, COPPA 2.0 would expand data protections to users aged 13 to 16.\n\nAdditionally, it would change the standard from \"actual knowledge\" to \"knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances.\" This creates more liability and costs for platforms to navigate. It is also unclear what data privacy protections would be in place for this newly collected data.\n\nVideo game specifics\n\nBoth KOSA and COPPA 2.0 broadly apply to video games, but these restrictions have more implications for certain parts of the industry.\n\nIn particular, games that rely on user generated content (UGC) or contain programmatic ads will face more restrictions if passed.\n\nKOSA specifically applies to online video games that allow users to create and upload content, engage in microtransactions within the game, or communicate with other users or incorporates minor-specific advertising.\n\nSimilarly, COPPA 2.0 would also ban targeted advertising to kids and teens.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_fragen@venturebeat.com", "name": "Jordan Fragen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duty of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microtransaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Targeted advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User-generated content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5535613157_305e02413d_o.jpg?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The dueling approaches have bogged down negotiations and delayed attempts to get any legislation over the finish line.\n\nThose disputes have thrown into doubt the fate of the proposals, which President Biden has indicated he would sign into law.\n\nSenators began crafting KOSA, the child safety measure, after conducting an investigation into 2021 disclosures by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen showing that the social media company knew its products at times worsened body image issues for some teens. The explosive revelations sparked indignation and catalyzed the legislative push on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have little to show for years of pledges to rein in the tech giants amid a litany of grievances.\n\nThe bill would create the new obligation for companies to mitigate potential harms to children, known as a \"duty of care.\" Since its introduction in 2022, a coalition of child safety advocates, youth activists and parents whose children's deaths were linked to social media has urged lawmakers to act, forming a powerful lobbying force that gave lawmakers a visceral reminder of the potential stakes.\n\n\"Nobody would blame these parents if they preferred to process their pain in privacy, curse the darkness, but instead they've shared their stories, pushed the Senate into action,\" Senate majority leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, said during a floor speech Thursday.\n\nMaurine Molak, whose son David died by suicide after facing intense cyberbullying online, said at a news conference in the Senate last week that Congress should pass the proposals \"because no other families should have to suffer the way we have.\"\n\nWhile KOSA has drawn broad bipartisan support in Congress, it has faced persistent opposition from tech industry and digital rights groups, which say it will chill speech online and force companies to collect even more data from users to comply with its obligations.\n\nEvan Greer, director of the liberal activist group Fight for the Future, said enforcers could use the \"duty of care\" provision to force companies to suppress content they dislike, including \"gender affirming care, abortion, racial justice, climate change, or anything else.\"\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and one of the three lawmakers who voted against the package, said in a post on X last week that he opposes KOSA because it could \"be used as a tool for MAGA extremists to wage war on legal and essential information to teens.\" Wyden also voiced concern that it could undermine privacy features like encryption. The bill's proponents dispute the claims.\n\nRepublican Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah also voted against the bills.\n\nThe push to expand privacy protections for children dates back decades. In 1998, Congress passed the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, a watershed law requiring that websites and other online services obtain parental consent before collecting data from kids up to 12.\n\nBut Senator Edward J. Markey, who led the push to pass COPPA as a member of the House in the 1990s, said he was unsuccessful then in his effort to extend those protections to teenagers, as the new bill does.\n\n\"This is the first time in 26 years that we've been able to come back and to put the protections that were needed then, and are even more needed today, on the books,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview.\n\nIf signed into law, COPPA 2.0 would widen the parental consent requirement for data collection to include information from children as old as 16. The bill would also ban companies from targeting kids and teens with advertising, a proposal Biden has vocally endorsed in his State of the Union addresses. KOSA has fomented more forceful opposition than COPPA 2.0.\n\nSchumer combined the two measures into a legislative package that the Senate began to formally consider Thursday, while eschewing other proposals to bar young kids from accessing social media altogether or to give victims of child sexual abuse a way to sue platforms for facilitating improper contacts.\n\nOdds for passage in the House this year appear dim. While Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently told CNBC he supports the idea behind the bills, the chair of a key committee considering them said House leadership has expressed concerns about the bills, without elaborating. And the chamber is only in session for just over a half dozen more weeks this year, with the election expected to sap lawmakers' attention in Washington. The House broke early for its annual August recess last week without rescheduling a markup for the bills.\n\nSpokespeople for Johnson and House majority leader Steve Scalise, also a Louisiana Republican, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesman for Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, whose committee recently yanked the bills from a legislative markup in the House, said she is \"pleased to see the Senate take this step and is fully committed to working together to continue advancing these important policies.\"\n\nEven if signed into law, the legislation is likely to face legal challenges from the tech industry, which has successfully halted parallel child online safety laws at the state level. While many cases are ongoing, federal judges have repeatedly expressed free-speech concerns over states' efforts to regulate social media companies, dealing a series of blows to laws aimed at protecting children.\n\nNetChoice, the tech trade association that has challenged those laws, has called KOSA \"unconstitutional,\" citing injunctions they secured against states as legal precedent.\n\nChris Marchese, who leads the group's litigation center, said Friday that the bill follows the same \"model of unconstitutionality\" as a defunct California law that sought to restrict the sale of violent video games to minors. The Supreme Court struck it down in 2011, ruling 7-2 that the sales were protected under the First Amendment.\n\nNetChoice counts Google, Amazon, and Meta as members, among others. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nProponents of KOSA have pushed back on those claims, arguing that the bill sidesteps thorny constitutional debates about speech online and instead seeks to bring consumer safety protections to social media, like regulations requiring seat belts in cars. Some tech companies have endorsed the bill, including Snapchat, LinkedIn-owner Microsoft, and Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Last Thursday, senators voted 86-1 to end the debate on the two bills and advance them to the floor, setting them up on a \"glide path to final passage,\" according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a co-sponsor of KOSA, said more needed to be done, but the bill \"goes in the right direction.\"\n\nAs the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has urged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg to compensate parents who lost their children over online harm.\n\n\"We need to allow parents to get their kids' data back, but it is a step forward to say you can't track and you can't target,\" he told The Epoch Times on Monday. \"It's a step forward to get parents some enforceable rights.\"\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and another KOSA co-sponsor, said she was \"very concerned about the disregard that large mediums have for the welfare of children.\"\n\n\"They know that their algorithms are used to target the very young -- meaning under age 13 and another bill 13 to 16 -- with advertising that diminishes the mental health of young people,\" she told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"They know that, and they're not dealing with it. And so, when they won't deal with it, we have to protect children.\"\n\nDuring the procedural vote last week, Sen. Rand Paul (R-K.Y.) was the only one who voted \"no\" to advance the bills.\n\nHe objected to KOSA and said it was too broad. He said it would create a Kids Online Safety Council that he considered \"speech police.\" He said KOSA would cause \"fear of liability, fear of lawsuits\" and lead to self-censorship by social media platforms, which in turn would stifle freedom of speech.\n\nMr. Schumer, though, hailed the bills as a \"groundbreaking step toward ensuring our kids' online safety.\"\n\n\"It's not an exaggeration to say these bills will be the most important updates in decades to federal laws that protect kids on the Internet. And it's a very good first step,\" he said last week.\n\nAlthough the report doesn't name any bills, it recommends \"enacting bipartisan federal legislation to protect youth health, safety, and privacy online.\" A key recommendation for families is creating a family media plan, including setting screen-free zones and times, and often discussing social media experiences.\n\nAbout 95 percent of teenagers and 40 percent of children between eight and 12 years of age use some form of social media, according to the report.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee still needs to advance the bills in the lower chamber.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ron Wyden of Oregon, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah voting against the bills. (RELATED: Google, Meta Among Big Tech Companies Challenging New York Child Safety Online Bills)\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts first introduced COPPA in 1998 when he was a House member, has since reintroduced the bill over two decades later in order to \"evolve\" and \"meet the reality of today's digital landscape\" and is cosponsored by Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, along with over a dozen other lawmakers. The revamped KOSA legislation was introduced by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, with Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee as a cosponsor, among others.\n\nA revised COPPA would ban targeted advertising towards minors and prohibit the collection of personal data from underage users, according to a press release. The bill would also create an \"eraser button,\" which allows children to delete their personal information from the platform.\n\n\"Big Tech is knowingly fueling a mental health crisis in this country by exploiting kids and teens just so they can make more money. It's Congress's job to stand up for young people and put an end to this,\" Markey said in a press release. \"I am proud of the protections guaranteed by my 1998 law, COPPA, but the fact remains that today's online guardrails were written before the invention of the iPhone. The law has to evolve to meet the reality of today's digital landscape. We won't address the threats to young people if we don't stop the data practices at the root of the problem.\" (RELATED: Senators Reveal Bipartisan Bill Targeting Big Tech Companies For Harms To Children)\n\nBlumenthal introduced KOSA in May of 2023, which requires social media platforms to provide minors with safeguards that restrict access to their personal data and provides parents with tools to moderate their child's platform usage, according to the bill summary.\n\n\"The bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which is supported by over half of the U.S. Senate, provides young people and parents with the tools, safeguards, and transparency they need to protect against online harms,\" Blumenthal said in a press release. \"The bill requires social media platforms to put the well-being of children first by providing an environment that is safe by default.\"\n\nBlumenthal's legislation has drawn the ire of some senators who cite concerns regarding freedom of speech and government overreach.\n\nThe bill would allow a state attorney general to take action if they have a \"reason to believe that an interest of residents of the State has been or is threatened or adversely affected by the engagement\" with social media content, according to the bill text.\n\n\"This is insane,\" Paul said during a floor speech on July 25. \"This bill is not well thought out, this bill is Pandora's box for censorship. In truth, this bill opens the door to nearly limitless content regulation.\"\n\nPaul described a \"self-policing effect\" that could take place as a result of these new regulations and standards.\n\n\"This bill does not merely regulate the internet, it threatens to stifle important and diverse discussions that are essential to a free society,\" Paul said during the floor speech.\n\nOther Senators maintain that the bill is not susceptible to bias from attorneys general. Blumenthal insists that there are safeguards in place to prevent content censorship or first amendment violations. (RELATED: 'Youth-Led' Anti-Big Tech Movement Is Controlled By A Dem-Linked Dark Money Operation)\n\n\"The Kids Online Safety Act does not give state Attorneys General or FTC the power to bring lawsuits over content or speech,\" Blumenthal said in a press release. \"The Kids Online Safety Act would not censor, block, or remove any content from the internet. The Kids Online Safety Act targets the harms that online platforms cause through their own product and business decisions - like how they design their products and applications to keep kids online for as long as possible, train their algorithms to exploit vulnerabilities, and target children with advertising.\"\n\nA source familiar with the bill, who is not authorized to speak publicly, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that there will be a standard of enforcement to ensure bias is not an issue.\n\n\"The updated draft also rests enforcement of the duty of care on the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that there is a uniform standard in the enforcement of the provision, rather than differing interpretations for each state,\" the source close to the issue told the DCNF.\n\nThis legislation also faced scrutiny from some LGBTQ groups who shared Paul's concerns about censorship. A coalition of over 90 LGBTQ groups sent a letter to Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in November of 2022 expressing their opposition to the bill.\n\n\"Online services would face substantial pressure to over-moderate, including from state Attorneys General seeking to make political points about what kind of information is appropriate for young people,\" the letter reads. \"At a time when books with LGBTQ+ themes are being banned from school libraries and people providing healthcare to trans children are being falsely accused of 'grooming,' KOSA would cut off another vital avenue of access to information for vulnerable youth.\"\n\nThe bill has received an onslaught of support from conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation and America First Policy Institute.\n\n\"Under current law, social media platforms evade compliance by writing in their policy that users under age 13 are prohibited from using their services, however they do very little to enforce the policy,\" the Heritage Foundation said in a press release. \"Nearly 70% of children under age 13 use social media. COPPA 2.0 better protects America's children by increasing the age of those covered by the law's protections to 16 and puts social media platforms on the hook for compliance.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Those safety provisions would require tech platforms to use \"reasonable care\" to avoid harming minors via design features such as personalized recommendations, notifications and appearance-altering filters.\n\nThe bill tasks the Federal Trade Commission -- which is led by the president's party -- with issuing guidance to platforms regarding online safety.\n\nSome youth advocates support KOSA, contending the restrictions will force tech companies to protect teens from material that could encourage drug use, self-harm or suicide.\n\nBut a broad array of opponents -- including civil liberties groups and tech industry organizations -- say the bill could empower government officials to effectively censor content they deem inappropriate for teens.\n\nThe digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation warned Tuesday that the bill gives the FTC the ability \"to decide what kind of content 'harms' minors, then investigate or file lawsuits against websites that host that content.\"\n\nThe tech industry funded think tank Chamber of Progress expressed similar concerns.\n\n\"Giving the next president the power to crack down on online speech poses a massive threat to our constitutional rights,\" Todd O'Boyle, Chamber of Progress senior tech policy director stated Tuesday. \"If there's one thing the far-left and far-right agree on, it's that the next chair of the FTC shouldn't get to decide what online posts are harmful.\"\n\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau executive vice president Lartease Tiffith likewise stated last week that the organization \"is particularly worried about provisions that may limit free speech, effectively placing government oversight on platform content decisions.\"\n\nSome opponents have expressed specific concerns that the bill would allow government officials to target platforms that allow teens to access LGBTQ content, on the theory that such material is harmful.\n\nConservatives also have voiced fears that the bill will encourage platforms to aggressively filter any controversial speech, including posts that carry right-wing messages.\n\nThe anti-abortion group Students for Life Action tweeted last week that KOSA threatens \"pro-life free speech.\"\n\n\"Already the Pro-Life Generation faces discrimination, de-platforming, and short-and-long term bans from social media based on the whims of others,\" the group posted to X (formerly Twitter). \"Students for Life Action calls for a NO vote on KOSA to prevent viewpoint discrimination from becoming federal policy at the FTC.\"\n\nEarlier this year, a House subcommittee advanced a companion version of KOSA, but with the expectation that the bill would be revised before reaching the House floor.\n\nRep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-New Jersey) said at the time that KOSA \"runs the risk of creating additional harm\" to young people by giving social media companies an incentive to suppress material.\n\nCritics also argue that the bill could lead tech companies to implement age verification systems, which could compromise people's privacy as well as their ability to access content anonymously.\n\nThe other portion of the Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act, COPPA 2.0, would prohibit websites and apps from collecting personal information -- including data stored on cookies, device identifiers and other pseudonymous information used for ad targeting -- from teens between the ages of 13 and 15, without first obtaining their explicit consent.\n\nThat portion of the bill would also ban targeted marketing to children and teens, and would require tech companies to allow users to delete personal information from users under the age of 17.\n\nThe self-regulatory privacy group Network Advertising Initiative praised the Senate's move, stating that \"responsible companies\" don't want to collect or use children's data for targeted advertising.\n\nFederal law already prohibits websites and apps from knowingly collecting personal information from children under 13 without parental consent.\n\nThe proposed updates would revise that standard by imposing liability if websites and apps have \"knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that a user is a child or teen.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, also known as COPPA 2.0, passed the Senate in a vote of 91 - T3.\n\nThe bills will next head to the House, though it's unclear if the measures will have enough support to pass. If passed into law, the bills would be the most significant pieces of legislation regulating tech companies in years.\n\nKOSA requires social media companies like Meta to offer controls to disable algorithmic feeds and other \"addictive\" features for children under the age of 16. It also requires companies to provide parental supervision features and safeguard minors from content that promotes eating disorders, self harm, sexual exploitation and other harmful content.\n\nOne of the most controversial provisions in the bill creates what's known as a \"duty of care.\" This means platforms are required to prevent or mitigate certain harmful effects of their products, like \"addictive\" features or algorithms that promote dangerous content. The Federal Trade Commission would be in charge of enforcing the standard.\n\nThe bill was originally introduced but stalled amid pushback from digital rights and other advocacy groups who said the legislation would force platforms on teens. A revised version, meant to address some of those concerns, was introduced last year, though the ACLU, EFF and other free speech groups still oppose the bill. In a statement last week, the ACLU said that KOSA would encourage social media companies \"to censor protected speech\" and \"incentivize the removal of anonymous browsing on wide swaths of the internet.\"\n\nCOPPA 2.0, on the other hand, has been less controversial among privacy advocates. of the 1998 Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, it aims to revise the nearly 30-year-old law to better reflect the modern internet and social media landscape. If passed, the law would prohibit companies from targeting advertising to children and collecting personal data on teens between 13 and 16 without consent. It also requires companies to offer an \"eraser button\" for personal data to delete children and teens' personal information from a platform when \"technologically feasible.\"\n\nThe vote underscores how online safety has become a rare source of bipartisan agreement in the Senate, which has hosted numerous hearings on teen safety issues in recent years.

The bipartisan legislation now needs to pass in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, which is currently on recess until September, before it could be sent to President Biden's desk to become law.\n\nReed, who was a cosponsor of KOSA, urged the House to follow the Senate's bipartisan lead to provide parents with improved tools to protect children's safety and privacy online; hold big tech platforms accountable, and mitigate social media practices aimed at keeping kids online and promoting addictive behavior.\n\n\"It is past time for Congress to better protect minors online from the dangers associated with the use of social media platforms. There can and should be commonsense, appropriate guardrails to help parents protect their kids online while also upholding civil liberties and free speech. Today, the Senate came together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen children's online privacy and safety laws and give parents more tools to protect their kids. After healthy debate and careful consideration, this targeted, bipartisan legislation would protect children's privacy and restrict algorithms from pushing harmful content and endless scrolling onto kids. It would hold social media companies accountable for their actions and crack down on the practice of targeting teens with manipulative content,\" said Senator Reed.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act would require companies to default to stringent privacy and safety settings, rather than putting the onus on youth and parents to navigate through complicated platforms. Tech companies would be required to \"exercise reasonable care\" to prevent their products from endangering child users, including through design features that could exacerbate depression, sexual exploitation, bullying, harassment and other harms. It also would require online companies to provide guardians with more control over minors' use of a platform and prevent certain features, such as autoplay. And it would require these companies to offer a dedicated page on which users can report harmful content.\n\nCOPPA 2.0 modernizes the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998. COPPA 2.0 would institute basic privacy protections for users under age 13, strengthen data privacy rights, and target Big Tech's underlying incentive to keep young people scrolling, clicking, and 'liking' content online for as long as possible. This legislation would prohibit internet companies from collecting personal information from teenage children without their consent and it would ban targeted advertising to children and teens. It would also help create an 'Eraser Button' by requiring companies to permit users to delete personal information from a child or teenager when technologically feasible.\n\nAccording to a recent study led by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube collectively derived nearly $11 billion in advertising revenue from U.S.-based users younger than 18 in 2022.\n\n\"Social media has the potential to both do good and cause harm. Congress has a responsibly to ensure social media platforms are doing their part to protect children and adolescents and hold them accountable if they refuse to comply with basic standards and best practices,\" said Senator Reed. \"Congress must also go above and beyond to uphold free speech. This bill takes a balanced approach. It does not regulate what people can post or infringe on freedom of expression. It ensures parents have the right to insist on the safest settings possible for their kids if they use social media,\" concluded Reed.\n\nCompanion legislation to KOSA has already been introduced in the House by Rep.

Cantwell. \"Social media companies are harvesting our children's personal data and making billions of dollars a year through targeted ads aimed at them. Taken together, COPPA 2.0 and KOSA will give parents new tools to protect their kids online, hold social media companies accountable for harm, require consent before data can be collected, and ban targeted advertising to kids under 17.\"\n\nThe bill the Senate passed today, the Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act, included provisions of two significant bills:\n\nThe Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0):\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA):\n\nThe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation chaired by Sen. Cantwell previously passed both bipartisan bills on July 27, 2023, and on July 27, 2022, the result of months of work with bill sponsors, stakeholders, and parents whose children were harmed. That collaborative process built consensus and the necessary support to secure today's strong showing on the Senate floor. Sen. Cantwell cosponsored COPPA 2.0 in February 2024.\n\nAccording to a Harvard University study, social media companies generated $11 billion in revenue from advertising directed at children and teenagers in 2022, including nearly $2 billion in ad revenue derived from users age 12 and under.\n\nIn January 2023, Seattle Public Schools filed a lawsuit against the companies operating TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, SnapChat, and YouTube, seeking to hold the companies responsible for having created \"digital environments that can negatively affect the mental and emotional health of our students.\" Everett School District No. 2 and Highline Public Schools have brought similar litigation against the social media companies.\n\nAs Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell has been a champion for securing data privacy protections. In March 2024, Sen. Cantwell and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R, WA-5) unveiled draft legislation for the bipartisan American Privacy Rights Act (APRA) that would establish clear, national data privacy rights and protections for Americans, eliminate the existing patchwork of state comprehensive data privacy laws, and establish robust enforcement mechanisms to hold violators accountable, including a private right of action for individuals.\n\nSen. Cantwell spoke on the Senate floor on KOSA and COPPA 2.0 last week ahead of a procedural vote to advance the legislation, which also passed on an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 86-1. Video of Sen.

That bill required parental sign-off for websites collecting or using data from kids under 13 years old.\n\nEven as COPPA 2.0's original co-sponsors Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and John Cassidy (R-LA) celebrated the bill's success, the fact remains that House passage during this Congressional term is unlikely. Congress is only in session for six more weeks, and a prominent House leader has said some key members have concerns about the suite of bills.\n\nThe other bill merged into KOPSA, known as the Kids' Online Safety Act (KOSA), creates what is known as a duty of care for websites to better protect children from harmful content and gives parents more control over what their children see online.\n\nBut it is COPPA 2.0 that most aggressively aims to protect children's privacy online.\n\nIn addition to prohibiting targeted advertising to children and teens under age 17 and requiring their consent for data collection, it also allows children and teens to easily delete their personal information and creates data minimization rules to limit how much information can be collected from them to begin with.\n\nCOPPA 2.0 was supported by a broad coalition of organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association and Common Sense Media.\n\n\"The Senate has sent a clear message that Big Tech's days of targeting and tracking kids and teenagers online are over,\" bill sponsors Markey and Cassidy said in a joint statement.\n\n\"Enough with harmful targeted advertising. Enough with collecting deeply personal information on young people ... Enough with leaving teens and parents powerless to delete a mistaken social media post. Enough with lining Big Tech's pockets at the expense of our young people.\"\n\nThe KOPSA bill has divided civil liberties groups and children's safety and privacy advocates, but opponents have focused their ire much more intensely on KOSA, which the American Civil Liberties Union says violates teenagers' First Amendment rights by pushing social media platforms to censor content and limiting what they can find online.\n\n\"KOSA compounds nationwide attacks on young peoples' right to learn and access information, on and offline,\" Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said in a statement.\n\n\"As state legislatures and school boards across the country impose book bans and classroom censorship laws, the last thing students and parents need is another act of government censorship deciding which educational resources are appropriate for their families.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Common Sense Media and Fairplay, which advocate for child safety and have spent months bringing families who have lost children due to online harms to Washington to meet with lawmakers, were effusive.\n\n\"Today, an overwhelming bipartisan majority of US Senators said that Big Tech must stop the unconscionable business practices and design choices that have fueled a mental health crisis and cost the lives of countless children around the country,\" Fairplay Executive Director Josh Golin said in a statement.\n\nThe mother of a 16-year-old boy who killed himself after months of online bullying in 2016 also hailed the bill's passage.\n\n\"Today's Senate vote marks a historic and emotional milestone for myself and for all parents who have fought tirelessly to protect our children from the dangerous environments created by Big Tech,\" Maurine Molak, who founded an advocacy organization honoring her son and fighting online bullying, said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "therecord.media", "dataType": "news", "title": "therecord.media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

First introduced in 2022 by a bipartisan pair of senators, KOSA aims to push the responsibility for protecting children on social media platforms onto the tech companies that own them. The legislation, championed by parents of children who died by suicide after cyberbullying, requires tech companies to take \"reasonable\" measures on their platforms to mitigate danger for kids by reducing cyberbullying, harm related to mental health disorders, and drug promotion.\n\nOpposition intensifies\n\nMicrosoft and Snap endorse KOSA, as do various child welfare advocacy organizations. Meta said it supports standards but prefers legislation requiring kids to get approval from parents before downloading apps. But opponents worry the bill gives too much power (even after revisions) to state attorneys general to decide what content is harmful to children. The ACLU, privacy experts, and free-speech advocates worry the bill could not only be unconstitutional, but could also empower government officials to torch anything on the internet they dislike.\n\nWhat's next? The House has its version of the bill headed to committee, but it's on recess until September. In the meantime, expect more tech companies to weigh in. -- MM", "source": {"uri": "morningbrew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morning Brew"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matty_merritt@morningbrew.com", "name": "Matty Merritt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Information_and_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Information and Advice", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/9d08c2bf83cee68023d5fe9f9d780b9d4655d964-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

It's a terrible idea to let politicians and bureaucrats decide what people should read and view online, but the Senate passed KOSA on a 91-3 vote.\n\nBill proponents have focused on some truly tragic stories of loss, and then tied these tragedies to the internet. But anxiety, eating disorders, drug abuse, gambling, tobacco and alcohol use by minors, and the host of other ills that KOSA purports to address all existed well before the internet.\n\nThe Senate vote means that the House could take up and vote on this bill at any time. The House could also choose to debate its own, similarly flawed, version of KOSA. Several members of the House have expressed concerns about the bill.\n\nThe members of Congress who vote for this bill should remember -- they do not, and will not, control who will be in charge of punishing bad internet speech. The Federal Trade Commission, majority-controlled by the President's party, will be able to decide what kind of content \"harms\" minors, then investigate or file lawsuits against websites that host that content.\n\nPoliticians in both parties have sought to control various types of internet content. One bill sponsor has said that widely used educational materials that teach about the history of racism in the U.S. causes depression in kids. Kids speaking out about mental health challenges or trying to help friends with addiction are likely to be treated the same as those promoting addictive or self-harming behaviors, and will be kicked offline. Minors engaging in activism or even discussing the news could be shut down, since the grounds for suing websites expand to conditions like \"anxiety.\"\n\nKOSA will lead to people who make online content about sex education, and LGBTQ+ identity and health, being persecuted and shut down as well. Views on how, or if, these subjects should be broached vary widely across U.S. communities. All it will take is one member of the Federal Trade Commission seeking to score political points, or a state attorney general seeking to ensure re-election, to start going after the online speech his or her constituents don't like.\n\nAll of these speech burdens will affect adults, too. Adults simply won't find the content that was mass-deleted in the name of avoiding KOSA-inspired lawsuits; and we'll all be burdened by websites and apps that install ID checks, age gates, and invasive (and poorly functioning) software content filters.\n\nThe vast majority of speech that KOSA affects is constitutionally protected in the U.S., which is why there is a long list of reasons that KOSA is unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the lawmakers voting for this bill have hand-waved away those concerns. They've also blown off the voices of millions of young people who will have their free expression constricted by this bill, including the thousands who spoke to EFF directly about their concerns and fears around KOSA.\n\nWe can't rely solely on lawsuits and courts to protect us from the growing wave of anti-speech internet legislation, with KOSA at its forefront. We need to let the people making the laws know that the public is becoming aware of their censorship plans -- and won't stand for them.", "source": {"uri": "eff.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Electronic Frontier Foundation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_mullin@eff.org", "name": "Joe Mullin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/icon-2019-freespeech.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The first bill, Coppa 2.0, would ban targeted advertising to minors and data collection without their consent, and give parents and kids the option to delete their information from social media platforms.\n\nTop US social media platforms made an estimated $11bn in advertising revenue from users younger than 18 in 2022, according to a Harvard study published last year.\n\nKosa, the second bill, would make explicit a \"duty of care\" that social media companies have when it comes to minors using their products, focusing on design of the platforms and regulation of the companies.\n\nExecutives at social media sites Snap Inc and X said at a congressional hearing in January they supported Kosa, while Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms and Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, said they disagreed with parts of it.\n\nTech industry groups and the American Civil Liberties Union have criticized the bill, saying that differing interpretations of harmful content could result in minors losing access to content related to vaccines, abortion or LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nSenators amended the language of the bill in response to such concerns earlier this year, in part by limiting the enforcement responsibility of states' attorneys general.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director at Fairplay for Kids, a group that supports the bills, said Kosa requires companies to mitigate specific risks, such as content that promotes eating disorders.\n\n\"Obviously government officials can do things that are not legal, but this does not

Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah voting against.\n\nIt's not yet clear if the bill will be taken up in the House, though House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled openness to the measure.\n\nThe legislative package is made up of a pair of key bills.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act requires platforms to provide safeguards for minors, including restricting access to minors' personal data and providing parents with tools to supervise minors' use of a platform, such as control of privacy and account settings. The bill would require limits on features that encourage children and teens to stay on the platform longer, including rewards for time spent on the platform and notifications. Platforms would also be required to provide minors with easily accessible options to delete their account or personal data, as well as options to limit the amount of time they spend on them.\n\nThe bill allows parents, minors and schools to submit reports if there is harm to a minor to which platforms would have to establish a process for responding. It would also prohibit advertisements shown to kids and teens that include narcotic drugs, tobacco products, gambling or alcohol.\n\nKOSA would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general could also bring civil actions if there are violations in their states.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee sponsored the bill and said the personal experiences of parents and young people, who visited DC, told their stories to lawmakers and wrote letters, are the heart of the bill.\n\nThe Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act amends the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to strengthen protections relating to the online collection, use and disclosure of personal information of children and teens, including allowing minors the opportunity to delete their personal data.\n\nThe bill bans targeted advertising to minors, such as based on a minor's search history. It also prohibits platforms from collecting personal data from users under the age of 17 without their consent, an increase in age of 13 from the original legislation.\n\nSponsors of the bill, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, said in a statement that the legislation \"has been intensely vetted, has strong support on both sides of the aisle, and directly targets Big Tech's underlying incentive to keep young people scrolling, clicking, and liking for as long as possible.\"\n\nThe push to further regulate social media use for minors at the federal level has been an ongoing mission and follows efforts by some state legislatures, including most recently Colorado and New York, to attempt to regulate social media platforms' influence over minors. Critics of the federal legislation, including the American Civil Liberties Union, tech advocacy and free speech groups, have pointed to potential violations of the First Amendment and obstacles to children and teens' abilities to access important resources.\n\n\"The requirements threaten the First Amendment rights of minors, which the Supreme Court has firmly established, and the vagueness of the requirements empowers states to target platforms that host speech the government wishes to suppress,\" the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said in a statement.\n\nEvan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group, warned in a statement that KOSA could stifle the ability of young people to research sensitive issues.\n\n\"Under a potential Trump administration, the FTC could easily use KOSA to target content related to gender affirming care, abortion, racial justice, climate change, or anything else that Project 2025-infused agency is willing to claim makes kids 'depressed' or 'anxious,'\" she said.\n\nBut Maurine Molak, the founder of the anti-bullying organization David's Legacy Foundation, said that her son's death by suicide at the age of 16 motivated her to work alongside other parents, families and young people to pass KOSA.\n\n\"This bill does not represent the government doing too much or intervening where they are not welcome. It is simply the government telling Big Tech they are no longer allowed to endanger children's lives in order to make a profit. Let's be clear, and accurate, about that,\" Molak wrote for the Austin American-Statesman last week.\n\nCNN's Clare Foran, Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

As soon as some kids oppose something like KOSA, their views no longer count.\n\nIt's no surprise given the way things were going, but the Senate today overwhelmingly passed KOSA by a 91 to 3 vote. The three no votes were from Senators Ron Wyden, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee.\n\nThere are still big questions about whether the House will follow suit, and, if so, how different their bill would be, and how the bills from the two chambers would be reconciled, but this is a step closer to KOSA becoming law, and creating all of the many problems people have been highlighting about it for years.\n\nOne thing I wanted to note, though, is how cynical the politicians supporting this have been. It's become pretty typical for senators to roll out \"example kids\" as a kind of prop as for why they have to pass these bills. They will have stories about horrible things that happened, but with no clear explanation for how this bill would actually prevent that bad thing, and while totally ignoring the many other bad things the bill would cause.\n\nIn the case of KOSA, we've already highlighted how it would do harm to all sorts of information and tools that are used to help and protect kids. The most obvious example is LGBTQ+ kids, who often use the internet to help find their identity or to communicate with others who might feel isolated in their physical communities. Indeed, GOP support for KOSA was conditioned on the idea that the law would be used to suppress LGBTQ+ related content.\n\nBut, I did find it notable that, after all of the pro-KOSA team using kids as props to vote for the bill, how little attention was given last week to the ACLU sending hundreds of students to Congress to tell them how much KOSA would harm them.\n\nLast week, the American Civil Liberties Union sent 300 high school students to Capitol Hill to lobby against the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill meant to protect children online.\n\nThe teenagers told the staffs of 85 lawmakers that the legislation could censor important conversations, particularly among marginalized groups like L.G.B.T.Q. communities.\n\n\"We live on the internet, and we are afraid that important information we've accessed all our lives will no longer be available,\" said Anjali Verma, a 17-year-old rising high school senior from Bucks County, Pa., who was part of the student lobbying campaign. \"Regardless of your political perspective, this looks like a censorship bill.\"\n\nBut somehow, that perspective gets mostly ignored in all of this.\n\nIt would have been nice to have had an actual discussion on the policy challenges here, but from the beginning, KOSA co-sponsors Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn refused to take any of the concerns about the bill seriously. They frequently insisted that any criticism of the bill was just \"big tech\" talking points.\n\nAnd, while they made cosmetic changes to try to appease some, the bill does not (and cannot) fix its fundamental problems. The bill is, fundamentally at its heart, a bill that is about censorship. And, while it does not directly demand censorship, the easiest and safest way to comply with the law will be to takedown whatever culture war hot topic politicians don't like.\n\nIt's kind of incredible that many of those who voted for the bill today were big supporters of the Missouri case against the administration (including Missouri's Attorney General who brought that suit, Eric Schmitt, who voted in favor of KOSA today). So, apparently, according to Schmitt, governments should never try to influence how social media companies decide to take down content, but also government should have the power to take enforcement action against companies that don't take down content the FTC decides is harmful.\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of hypocrisy here. And it would be nice if someone asked the senators voting in favor of this law why they were going against the wishes of all the kids who visited the Hill last week. After all, that's what the senators who trotted out kids on the other side tried to do to those few senators who pointed out the flaws in this terrible law.", "source": {"uri": "techdirt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techdirt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_masnick@techdirt.com", "name": "Mike Masnick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bicameralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Schmitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucks_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bucks County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bucks County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.techdirt.com/wp-content/themes/techdirt/assets/images/techdirt-white-square.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

It now heads to the House, where it's unclear if it can pass given the limited legislative time left in a tumultuous election year.\n\nThe legislation marks one of the first major attempts to regulate social media since it became a ubiquitous part of many children and teens' lives.\n\nOne of the bills that passed on Tuesday would require social media companies to show that they are taking \"reasonable measures\" to protect minors from harms online. That includes content that promotes suicide, violence, bullying, eating disorders, sexual abuse, drug use and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.\n\nIt would also give minors the option to turn off features that encourage \"addiction-like\" use of the platform and algorithm-based content recommendations. Many of the most popular social media platforms are set up to feed users more of what they interact with, not just all content shared to a site or app.\n\nThe other bill would update an existing online privacy law to ban targeted ads for minors, extend privacy protections to users between the ages of 13 and 16, and give parents the ability to delete their kids' personal information from platforms.\n\nSome of the fiercest advocates for the bills have been the parents of children and teens who died as a result of something they encountered online, such as drug overdoses or bullying that pushed them to die by suicide.\n\n\"We have to do something,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"These parents have turned their grief into grace. These parents are the reason that we succeeded today.\"\n\nSchumer urged the House to take up the bills \"as soon as they can.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed support for the bills. But the lower chamber is only in session for a few more weeks through the end of the year, with long breaks in August and October to allow for campaign work.\n\nWhile some major tech companies have supported the legislation - including Microsoft and X - others have opposed it and are likely to challenge it in court if it does become law.\n\nNetChoice, an advocacy group that includes many major tech companies including Google and Meta, called the bill \"unconstitutional\" in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"Parents need solutions that are legal and meaningful, but KOSA is neither,\" said NetChoice General Counsel Carl Szabo in a statement. \"KOSA's data privacy, cybersecurity, censorship, and constitutional risks remain unaddressed. NetChoice hopes to work with lawmakers in the House to protect minors and families from KOSA's many issues.\"\n\nLGBTQ groups raised concerns that a previous version of KOSA could be used by certain state attorneys general to censor information about gender and sexuality.

Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a longtime privacy advocate who said on social media last week that \"the final version of this bill is improved\" but he would still vote no.\n\n\"The changes that I, LGBTQ+ advocates, parents, student activists, civil rights orgs, and others have fought for over the last two years have made it less likely that the bill can be used as a tool for MAGA extremists to wage war on legal and essential information to teens,\" Wyden said.\n\n\"While constructive, these improvements remain insufficient,\" he continued. \"I fear KOSA could be used to sue services that offer privacy technologies like encryption or anonymity features that kids rely on to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by predators online.\"\n\nWyden added that \"I also take very seriously concerns voiced by the American Civil Liberties Union, Fight for the Future, and LGBTQ+ teens and advocates that a future MAGA administration could still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans, and reproductive health information.\"\n\nThe ACLU and Fight for the Future reiterated those concerns on Tuesday, joined at a press conference by leaders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, TransOhio, and Woodhull Freedom Foundation.\n\n\"We need legislation that addresses the harm of Big Tech. And still lets young people fight for the type of world that they actually want to grow up in,\" declared Evan Greer, director at Fight for the Future.\n\nJenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said that \"as state legislatures and school boards across the country impose book bans and classroom censorship laws, the last thing students and parents need is another act of government censorship deciding which educational resources are appropriate for their families.\"\n\nThe bill still needs to get through the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. Already, two of the chamber's leading progressives, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) have come out against it. Leventoff declared that \"the House must block this dangerous bill before it's too late.\"\n\nLast week, the ACLU led over 300 students in a lobbying day on Capitol Hill to oppose the package.\n\n\"It's called the Kids Online Safety Act, but they have to consider kids' voices, and some of us don't think it will make us safer,\" Anjali Verma, a 17-year-old high school senior, said Tuesday. \"We live on the internet, and we are afraid that important information we've accessed all our lives will no longer be available. We need lawmakers to listen to young people when making decisions that affect us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) celebrated the package's passage, joined by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.).\n\nCassidy and Markey spearheaded COPPA 2.0, which has not elicited criticism from rights groups the way KOSA has. They said in a joint statement that their bill's passage \"is an overdue and much-needed victory\" for young people and with the vote, \"the Senate has sent a clear message that Big Tech's days of targeting and tracking kids and teenagers online are over.\"\n\n\"Enough with harmful targeted advertising,\" the senators said. \"Enough with collecting deeply personal information on young people. Enough with ignoring the health and well-being [of] millions of young people. Enough with leaving teens and parents powerless to delete a mistaken social media post. Enough with lining Big Tech's pockets at the expense of our young people.\"\n\n\"To the parents, advocates, and young people who have been heroically fighting for these privacy protections for more than a decade, we thank you. We would not be here without your passion, commitment, and bravery,\" they added. \"This vote is a breakthrough moment for tech regulation in the United States with Congress finally stepping up to the plate and putting real guardrails on Big Tech's pernicious business model.\"\n\nJosh Golin, executive director of Fairplay and co-founder of ParentsSOS, said that \"today's historic vote is a testament to the tireless efforts of parents who have lost their children to Big Tech's greed and an incredible coalition that believes a better internet for young people is possible. We thank Sens. Blackburn, Blumenthal, Cassidy, and Markey for introducing this game-changing legislation and call on the House to follow the Senate's lead.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType":

It's not yet clear if the bill will be taken up in the House, though House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled openness to the measure.\n\nThe legislative package is made up of a pair of key bills.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act requires platforms to provide safeguards for minors, including restricting access to minors' personal data and providing parents with tools to supervise minors' use of a platform, such as control of privacy and account settings. The bill would require limits on features that encourage children and teens to stay on the platform longer, including rewards for time spent on the platform and notifications. Platforms would also be required to provide minors with easily accessible options to delete their account or personal data, as well as options to limit the amount of time they spend on them.\n\nThe bill allows parents, minors and schools to submit reports if there is harm to a minor to which platforms would have to establish a process for responding. It would also prohibit advertisements shown to kids and teens that include narcotic drugs, tobacco products, gambling or alcohol.\n\nKOSA would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general could also bring civil actions if there are violations in their states.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee sponsored the bill and said the personal experiences of parents and young people, who visited DC, told their stories to lawmakers and wrote letters, are the heart of the bill.\n\nThe Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act amends the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to strengthen protections relating to the online collection, use and disclosure of personal information of children and teens, including allowing minors the opportunity to delete their personal data.\n\nThe bill bans targeted advertising to minors, such as based on a minor's search history. It also prohibits platforms from collecting personal data from users under the age of 17 without their consent, an increase in age of 13 from the original legislation.\n\nSponsors of the bill, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, said in a statement that the legislation \"has been intensely vetted, has strong support on both sides of the aisle, and directly targets Big Tech's underlying incentive to keep young people scrolling, clicking, and liking for as long as possible.\"\n\nThe push to further regulate social media use for minors at the federal level has been an ongoing mission and follows efforts by some state legislatures, including most recently Colorado and New York, to attempt to regulate social media platforms' influence over minors. Critics of the federal legislation, including the American Civil Liberties Union, tech advocacy and free speech groups, have pointed to potential violations of the First Amendment and obstacles to children and teens' abilities to access important resources.\n\n\"The requirements threaten the First Amendment rights of minors, which the Supreme Court has firmly established, and the vagueness of the requirements empowers states to target platforms that host speech the government wishes to suppress,\" the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said in a statement.\n\nEvan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group, warned in a statement that KOSA could stifle the ability of young people to research sensitive issues.\n\n\"Under a potential Trump administration, the FTC could easily use KOSA to target content related to gender affirming care, abortion, racial justice, climate change, or anything else that Project 2025-infused agency is willing to claim makes kids 'depressed' or 'anxious,'\" she said.\n\nBut Maurine Molak, the founder of the anti-bullying organization David's Legacy Foundation, said that her son's death by suicide at the age of 16 motivated her to work alongside other parents, families and young people to pass KOSA.\n\n\"This bill does not represent the government doing too much or intervening where they are not welcome. It is simply the government telling Big Tech they are no longer allowed to endanger children's lives in order to make a profit. Let's be clear, and accurate, about that,\" Molak wrote for the Austin American-Statesman last week.\n\nCNN's Clare Foran, Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.", "source":

U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, twice led the passage of the bills through the Committee, and worked tirelessly with bill sponsors, stakeholders and parents whose children were harmed, to build consensus and support necessary to secure Senate approval.\n\n\"Americans, including kids, are being tracked across the internet and every place they go with a phone or mobile device,\" said Sen. Cantwell. \"Social media companies are harvesting our children's personal data and making billions of dollars a year through targeted ads aimed at them. Taken together, COPPA 2.0 and KOSA will give parents new tools to protect their kids online, hold social media companies accountable for harm, require consent before data can be collected and ban targeted advertising to kids under 17.\n\nSen. Cantwell led the successful passage of COPPA 2.0 and KOSA through the Senate Commerce Committee on July 27, 2022, and again on July 27, 2023. She met several times with families whose children were harmed and worked continuously to strengthen support for the legislation in the Senate.\n\nThe Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) bans online companies from collecting personal information from users under 17 years old without their consent. It bans targeted advertising to children and teens and creates an eraser button for parents and kids to eliminate personal information online. The bill also establishes a Youth Marketing and Privacy Division at the FTC. In February, Sen. Cantwell joined as a bill cosponsor.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act provides children and parents with the tools, safeguards, and transparency to protect against online harms.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called Tuesday's passage of the Kids Online Safety Act \"monumental\" after working for years to get legislation through the Senate that regulates how tech companies design their sites.\n\nThe bill's passage is the culmination of work from Blumenthal and his co-author, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., as well as groups seeking safeguards for minors that include parents who have attributed the deaths of their children to harmful content viewed on social media.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act, commonly referred to as KOSA, would put in place stricter settings by allowing children and parents to disable addictive features, enable privacy settings and opt out of algorithmic recommendations. It establishes a \"duty of care\" that would that would require companies to make efforts to prevent harm to minors related to certain mental health disorders, physical violence, online bullying, eating disorders and sexual exploitation.\n\n\"I think that we're showing that Congress actually can work productively on safeguards dealing with the internet and tech,\" Blumenthal said. \"We're putting controls and safeguards on repetitive and addictive unwanted content.\"\n\nSupporters of the bill expect to see another massive lobbying effort by Big Tech in the following weeks to prevent a vote in the House. Students and young users have also done their own lobbying blitzes on Capitol Hill, both for and against the Kids Online Safety Act.\n\nMore than 300 students organized by the American Civil Liberties Union spoke with lawmakers ahead of Tuesday's vote to urge a vote against KOSA.\n\n\"We live on the internet, and we are afraid that important information we've accessed all our lives will no longer be available,\" Anjali Verma, who is a rising high school senior, said in a statement through the ACLU. \"We need lawmakers to listen to young people when making decisions that affect us.\"\n\nOther youth activists, meanwhile, are firmly behind KOSA. They are seeking legislation that will protect them from harmful content that continues to pop up on their feeds despite trying to keep it off their accounts.\n\n\"On the long list of priorities that Big Tech has, user choice is at the bottom,\" Isabel Sunderland of Design It For Us said at a briefing last week with Blumenthal, Blackburn and grieving parents. \"We don't have a choice when these companies have finally engineered their platforms to manipulate young people into staying on their sites longer as they deliver vicious platters of addictive, divisive and harmful content.\"\n\nSupporters and opponents of the Kids Online Safety Act share a similar goal: holding tech giants accountable over how children and teenagers navigate online platforms and reducing harms. But they diverge on how to achieve that outcome.\n\nIf the Kids Online Safety Act becomes law, the measure is expected to face lawsuits.\n\nU.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., one of the three lawmakers who voted against KOSA, similarly shared concerns related to free speech and believes the bill would not hold up in court if it faces legal challenges.

I want to thank Senator Blumenthal for his excellent partnership, along with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Ranking Member Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for helping us carry this across the finish line in the Senate.\"\n\n\"I also appreciate our House champions for pushing this legislation. The Senate passage of KOSA could not have been possible without the support of the over 240 organizations lined up behind this legislation and the hundreds of parents that have flown to Washington on their own dime to lobby Congress and push this legislation forward. The 91 Senators from across the political spectrum that stood up to Big Tech and voted in favor of this legislation have helped save countless innocent lives from being exploited online,\" Blackburn stated.\n\n\"This moving and historic day marks a major win for our children. Anyone who doubted whether we'd reach this milestone has never met our advocates - the parents who have lost children and the young people who refused to be treated like Big Tech piggy banks,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"Through their shared grief, these families worked with grit and grace to be some of the most dedicated and devoted advocates my colleagues have ever seen.\n\n\"I am deeply grateful to Senators Schumer and McConnell for moving the Kids Online Safety Act through the Senate and to Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz for their leadership on the Commerce Committee. We are excited now to work with our champions in the House of Representatives. I am confident that the support of our large, diverse, determined coalition will get this bill across the finish line. It will be the first internet safety reform in nearly three decades - a resounding bipartisan achievement showing democracy still works,\" Blumenthal stated.\n\nSenators Blackburn and Blumenthal first introduced the Kids Online Safety Act in February 2022 following reporting by the Wall Street Journal and after spearheading a series of five subcommittee hearings with social media companies and advocates on the repeated failures by tech giants to protect kids on their platforms.\n\nKOSA will require platforms to enable the strongest privacy settings by default, force platforms to prevent and mitigate specific dangers to minors, provide parents and educators new controls to help protect children, and require independent audits and research into social media companies.\n\nClick here to

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a senior member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today voted for bipartisan legislation to protect youth from exploitation online and help rein in Big Tech. The package, which substantially includes the Grassley-backed Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0), passed the Senate by a vote of 91-3. It now heads to the House of Representatives for further consideration.\n\n\"Our laws must reflect reality. We live in a highly digital world that leaves internet users, particularly kids and teens, vulnerable,\" Grassley said. \"The Senate's overwhelming support for these measures is a major step towards better safeguarding youth from bad actors hiding behind their screens.

I want to thank Senator Blumenthal for his excellent partnership, along with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Ranking Member Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for helping us carry this across the finish line in the Senate. I also appreciate our House champions for pushing this legislation. The Senate passage of KOSA could not have been possible without the support of the over 240 organizations lined up behind this legislation and the hundreds of parents that have flown to Washington on their own dime to lobby Congress and push this legislation forward. The 91 Senators from across the political spectrum that stood up to Big Tech and voted in favor of this legislation have helped save countless innocent lives from being exploited online.\"\n\n\"This moving and historic day marks a major win for our children. Anyone who doubted whether we'd reach this milestone has never met our advocates - the parents who have lost children and the young people who refused to be treated like Big Tech piggy banks,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"Through their shared grief, these families worked with grit and grace to be some of the most dedicated and devoted advocates my colleagues have ever seen. I am deeply grateful to Senators Schumer and McConnell for moving the Kids Online Safety Act through the Senate and to Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz for their leadership on the Commerce Committee. We are excited now to work with our champions in the House of Representatives. I am confident that the support of our large, diverse, determined coalition will get this bill across the finish line. It will be the first internet safety reform in nearly three decades - a resounding bipartisan achievement showing democracy still works.\"\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nSenators Blackburn and Blumenthal first

Murthy likened social media to cigarettes, calling for warning labels on digital products.\n\nUnder KOSA, companies will be held accountable for the harm their products may cause. They will have a \"duty of care\" to protect young people from interacting with overly sexualized content, content that may lead to eating disorders, addictions, and content that promotes generally harmful behavior.\n\nThe firms will also be expected to be transparent about how their algorithms work and be able to show their products do not have psychologically manipulative features - go figure, that's how social media firms generate money. The other bill, Children's Online Privacy Protection Action, or COPPA 2.0, focuses more on advertising and data privacy. The dual package had massive support, with the vote going 91-3. Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and GOP Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, were the only ones who gave it the thumbs down.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, said such actions will \"save lives.\" He added, \"What we're doing is giving parents and kids the tools to disconnect from harmful content, bullying, eating disorders, stuff that really hurts them, and also impose a duty of care on Big Tech that for too long, has said 'trust us' and betrayed that trust. And now, they're going to have to comply with a law that imposes a duty on them to mitigate or prevent harm.\"\n\nMeta Platforms Inc., one of the companies that has faced the most critical storms over allegedly damaging or dangerous content, said it supports the bills. The American Civil Liberties Union does not. It aired concern that what this really means is \"nationwide attacks on young peoples' right to learn and access information, on and offline.\"\n\n\"As state legislatures and school boards across the country impose book bans and classroom censorship laws, the last thing students and parents need is another act of government censorship deciding which educational resources are appropriate for their families,\" said Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU. \"The House must block this dangerous bill before it's too late.\"\n\nThere's still some way to go before the bills become law, and there will be plenty of opposition. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this should never become a reality, with the foundation calling the bills \"unconstitutional censorship.\"", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Murthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Murthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duty of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/07/woman-looking-her-phone-close-up.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

This is the most significant step Congress has taken to keep children safe on the internet in decades. Senator Fetterman released the following statement in response:\n\n\"We all know the positive side of the internet, but social media can take a serious toll on mental health. I've experienced this firsthand and I've spoken openly about it. We must do more to protect our children's privacy online and safeguard their mental health - these bills are critical steps to do just that.\n\n\"I'm especially proud to have worked to improve this legislation so that far-right attorneys general or federal appointees will not be able to weaponize it to censor both content that supports LGBTQ+ youth and content that provides information on reproductive health care.\n\n\"It's good to see that we're stepping up to protect our children. I'm proud of the work I've done on this legislation and wish I could have been in DC to vote for it, instead of home in Braddock with COVID. I hope the House takes it up and passes it as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act will create regulations that govern what content tech and social media companies are able to offer to minors online through algorithm recommendations. The bills will require companies to take steps to mitigate harm to children, including bullying, violence, the promotion of suicide, eating disorder content, and more. The legislation will also change how these companies can use young people's data.\n\nAfter hearing concerns with the legislation from LGBTQ+ organizations, Senator Fetterman worked with his colleagues to address concerns that KOSA could violate First Amendment rights if weaponized by rightwing state attorneys general. Senator Fetterman cosponsored the revised version of the bill, which ensures that LGBTQ+ social media content cannot be interpreted as harmful by right wing state attorneys general and federal appointees.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fetterman_(reporter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Fetterman (reporter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Children's Online Privacy Protection Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Information_and_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Information and Advice", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 26}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The Kids Online Safety Act and the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) passed the Senate as part of the Kids Online Safety & Privacy Act.\n\n\"Our kids use the internet for homework, learning, gaming, and staying connected with friends. As parents, we must ensure the internet is a safer, more secure space for children and teens. That's the goal of this legislation,\" said Heinrich. \"These two bills will empower parents to safeguard their kids' well-being and privacy -- while holding Big Tech accountable.\"\n\nHeinrich continued, \"It's time for social media companies to prioritize our children's safety and privacy over engagement and profits. With this legislation, we tell Big Tech: Our children's private lives are not for sale. I will continue to fight for policies that put the interests of New Mexicans first by putting guardrails on Big Tech that protect safety, privacy, and civil liberties.\"\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act would provide kids and parents with better tools to protect themselves online, hold Big Tech accountable, and provide transparency into black box algorithms. The legislation is led by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).\n\nHeinrich pushed to update language to ensure that the focus of the bill was to protect children from addictive and harmful social media platform design features, not to empower overzealous state attorneys general to police and penalize children for accessing and creating online content.\n\nSpecifically, the Kids Online Safety Act:\n\nRequires social media platforms to provide minors with options to protect their information, disable addictive product features, and opt out of personalized algorithmic recommendations.\n\nPlatforms are also required to enable the strongest privacy settings for kids by default.\n\nGives parents new controls to help protect their children and spot harmful behaviors, and provides parents and educators with a dedicated channel to report harmful behavior.\n\nCreates a duty for online platforms to prevent and mitigate specific dangers to minors, including promotion of suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, sexual exploitation, and advertisements for certain illegal products (e.g. tobacco and alcohol).\n\nEnsures that parents and policymakers know whether online platforms are taking meaningful steps to address risks to kids by requiring independent audits and research into how these platforms impact the well-being of kids and teens.\n\nThe updated bill text can be found here.\n\nThe landing page with the latest information about the bill is here and helpful resources can be found here.\n\nThe Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) would modernize and strengthen the online privacy law for children, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA 2.0 is led by U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.).\n\nSpecifically, the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act:\n\nBuilds on COPPA by prohibiting internet companies from collecting personal information from users who are 13 to 16 years old without their consent.\n\nBans targeted advertising to children and teens.\n\nRevises COPPA's \"actual knowledge\" standard to close the loophole that allows covered platforms to ignore kids and teens on their site.\n\nCreates an \"eraser button\" by requiring companies to permit users to eliminate personal information from a child or teen when technologically feasible.\n\nEstablishes data minimization rules to prohibit the excessive collection of children and teens' data.\n\nA one-page summary of the bill is here.\n\nThe text of the bill is here.\n\nLast week, Heinrich also passed the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act of 2024 (DEFIANCE Act), legislation he cosponsored

It's a terrible idea to let politicians and bureaucrats decide what people should read and view online, but the Senate passed KOSA on a 91-3 vote.\n\nTAKE ACTION -- Don't let Congress censor the internet\n\nBill proponents have focused on some truly tragic stories of loss, and then tied these tragedies to the internet. But anxiety, eating disorders, drug abuse, gambling, tobacco and alcohol use by minors, and the host of other ills that KOSA purports to address all existed well before the internet.\n\nThe Senate vote means that the House could take up and vote on this bill at any time. The House could also choose to debate its own, similarly flawed, version of KOSA. Several members of the House have expressed concerns about the bill.\n\nThe members of Congress who vote for this bill should remember -- they do not, and will not, control who will be in charge of punishing bad internet speech. The Federal Trade Commission, majority-controlled by the President's party, will be able to decide what kind of content \"harms\" minors, then investigate or file lawsuits against websites that host that content.\n\nPoliticians in both parties have sought to control various types of internet content. One bill sponsor has said that widely used educational materials that teach about the history of racism in the U.S. causes depression in kids. Kids speaking out about mental health challenges or trying to help friends with addiction are likely to be treated the same as those promoting addictive or self-harming behaviors, and will be kicked offline. Minors engaging in activism or even discussing the news could be shut down, since the grounds for suing websites expand to conditions like \"anxiety.\"\n\nKOSA will lead to people who make online content about sex education, and LGBTQ+ identity and health, being persecuted and shut down as well. Views on how, or if, these subjects should be broached vary widely across U.S. communities. All it will take is one member of the Federal Trade Commission seeking to score political points, or a state attorney general seeking to ensure re-election, to start going after the online speech his or her constituents don't like.\n\nAll of these speech burdens will affect adults, too. Adults simply won't find the content that was mass-deleted in the name of avoiding KOSA-inspired lawsuits; and we'll all be burdened by websites and apps that install ID checks, age gates, and invasive (and poorly functioning) software content filters.\n\nThe vast majority of speech that KOSA affects is constitutionally protected in the U.S., which is why there is a long list of reasons that KOSA is unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the lawmakers voting for this bill have hand-waved away those concerns. They've also blown off the voices of millions of young people who will have their free expression constricted by this bill, including the thousands who spoke to EFF directly about their concerns and fears around KOSA.\n\nWe can't rely solely on lawsuits and courts to protect us from the growing wave of anti-speech internet legislation, with KOSA at its forefront. We need to let the people making the laws know that the public is becoming aware of their censorship plans -- and won't stand for them.\n\nJoe Mullin is a senior policy analyst at EFF, where he works on patents, encryption, platform liability, and free expression online.

The legislation also would expand existing privacy protections to forbid the collection of personal data from children under the age of 16.\n\nThe legislation still must clear the U.S. House before heading to the president's desk.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, said Tuesday he generally backs the legislation. President Joe Biden has indicated he would sign it into law.\n\n\"The internet is an integral part of children's lives today. It is time our laws reflect this new reality,\" said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge. \"These bills provide parents the tools to safeguard their kids online.\"\n\nHe was one of the two main sponsors for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, called COPPA 2.0. Along with expanding existing parental consents on data collection, COPPA 2.0 bans advertising targeted at youth.\n\nThe bill builds on a law passed in the 1990s primarily sponsored by then-Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-Chackbay, and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts.\n\nCassidy also was a co-sponsor of Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, which would require online platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent harm to users.\n\nThe bills arose as parents began questioning the connection between online usage and increased suicide and other anti-social behavior among their children.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has declared children's mental health has become a national emergency. The federal Centers for Disease Control & Prevention found that in 2021, one in three high school girls contemplated suicide.\n\nCassidy blamed digital platforms which collect data from users and then compile algorithms that target advertising and content at specific individuals. He pointed to studies that linked online usage to increased dangerous behavior by children. He also noted that a Harvard University study in 2022 calculated that the major platforms earned about $11 billion from selling data-driven advertising and content that targeted U.S. users under the age of 17.\n\nThe effort to pass online restrictions for children bogged down as Big Tech argued the provisions violated First Amendment rights.\n\nCassidy countered that accepted law has long allowed for marketing carve-outs for the First Amendment, such as a ban on advertising cigarettes to youth.\n\nMarkey, who cosponsored COPPA 2.0 with Cassidy, said the bill updated 1990s legislation addressing children's television programming that essentially was just advertising goods to kids. Markey said he and Tauzin added parameters as the digital sphere expanded. The new bills would provide updates to reflect the way social media does business now.\n\n\"The United States Senate will finally send a message to Big Tech that the days of indiscriminately tracking and targeting children and teens are over in our country. That their privacy-invasive business models must change,\" Markey said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said \"this moment is when the Senate said, 'There have been horrible abuses. We must end them, and we will.'\"\n\nSchumer lauded the bipartisan effort to overcome opposition and get the long-stalled package moving again.\n\n\"The House should pass these bills as soon as they can,\" he said.\n\nJohnson said in a statement shortly after the Senate vote that he's committed to finding consensus in the House.\n\n\"I am looking forward to reviewing the details of the legislation that comes out of the Senate,\" he said. \"Parents should have greater control and the necessary tools to protect their kids online.\"\n\nLouisiana's junior senator, John N. Kennedy, R-Madisonville, was among the 91 senators backing the legislation. The three \"no\" votes were Sens Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Ron Wyden, D-Oregon.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors":

Big Tech and their algorithms aim to maximize time spent online, and it's clear that young Americans' mental health and well-being are not always a priority for these companies. From bullying to promoting dangerous content, report after report shows that online platforms can have a harmful impact on children.\n\n\"More must be done to hold companies accountable for online harm and empower parents to protect their children. The bipartisan vote to strengthen children's online safety sends a clear message that online platforms must be made safer and that the power belongs in the hands of the user.

As the vote was taking place, a group of human rights, LGBTQ+, and civil liberties experts held a virtual press conference to discuss the longstanding issues with the bill, how passing it would be a major handout to Big Tech, and why the House must reject it.\n\nYou can watch the press conference in full at this link or below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwufHSTjdgE\n\nHere a sampling of important quotes given during the press conference:\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, young people are naturally curious and taking away potentially educational resources limits their learning and can actually endanger them.\" -Jenna Leventoff, Senior Policy Counsel at American Civil Liberties Union\n\n\"I think some of this is just based on hoping or believing that the enforcement of a speech law will be done by the good guys. And that's we've just never seen that be the case. And that's why it's better to stick by our First Amendment values.\" -Joe Mullin, Senior Policy Analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\n\"I'm really particularly concerned about the impact on youth in states that are already living under abortion bans or living in the 25 States that have bans on gender and care. I think you're just gonna see that kind of censorship get much worse.\" -Mandy Salley, Chief Operating Officer at Woodhull Freedom Foundation\n\n\"I've literally had legislators tell me to my face that they would love to see our website taken off the Internet because they don't want people to have the kinds of vital community resources that we provide.\" -Dara Adkison, Executive Director of TransOhio\n\n\"We need legislation that addresses the harm of big tech. And still lets young people fight for the type of world that they actually want to grow up in.\" -Evan Greer, Director at Fight for the Future\n\nSenator Ron Wyden (OR) also sent in this quote to be read during the press conference:\n\n\"Everyone agrees tech companies need to be held accountable, and Congress needs to do more to keep kids safe online. But that shouldn't mean making some kids safer while putting others in harms' way. I appreciate the intent of KOSA, and support restrictions on harmful design elements, along with new privacy protections for teenagers. At the same time, I implore my colleagues in the House to listen to the LGBTQ+ teens and the folks on the call today. It is not too late to do more to ensure that KOSA can't be misused by MAGA politicians who are waging a dangerous and retrograde culture war. It's not too late to make commonsense changes that ensure KOSA can't be used to scare platforms away from responsible use of privacy protecting technologies like encryption or anonymous accounts. I hope Congress can work together to pass legislation to make ALL kids safer online.\"\n\nThe grassroots human rights coalition opposing KOSA will redouble our efforts to stop it in the House, where younger progressives like Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep Maxwell Frost have already come out against it.\n\nAdditional resources about the opposition to KOSA:", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KOSA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Frontier Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxwell Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Wyden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_for_the_Future", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fight for the Future"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Child Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMjEwMDM4OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTE0ODI1N30.nWE-dO3LpGCfrP6HKKrgMGYA-9xT8aazabGiQTfcsrM/image.png?width=210", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775471", "eventUri": "eng-9775471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The House has just begun its six-week summer recess and won't return to Washington until Sept. 9. And while he's supportive of the \"purpose\" of the bills, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he's still reviewing the legislation and hasn't scheduled a vote.\n\nThe two bills in the package -- known as the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, and the Children's and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA 2.0 -- represent the most significant congressional action in decades to regulate social media's impact on children and teens.\n\nThe lopsided vote was 91-3, with Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and GOP Sens.

This follows a series of congressional hearings with major social media CEOs on the dangers kids face online and a recent study revealing that Big Tech companies generated $11 billion in revenue from advertising directed at children and teens in 2022 -- including nearly $2 billion in ad revenue derived from users age 12 and under. This bipartisan online safety package now heads to the House of Representatives for final passage.\n\n\"Keeping young Nevadans safe is my top priority. I'm proud to have voted to pass this commonsense legislation that gives Nevada children and families more tools to protect their themselves online while making sure social media companies are doing more to prevent harmful content on their platforms,\" said Senator Cortez Masto.\n\nThis children's online safety package includes the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act 2.0 (COPPA 2.0). The bipartisan KOSA will direct social media platforms to turn on the strongest privacy settings for kids by default, disable addictive product features, and allow families to opt-out of personalized algorithmic recommendations, all while requiring independent audits by experts to ensure that social media platforms are addressing risks to kids. The COPPA 2.0 will update online data privacy rules for the 21 century by banning targeted advertising to children and teens, preventing social media platforms from collecting personal information from minors without consent, and making it easier for parents and kids to hide personal information online.\n\nAs the former top law enforcement official in Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto has spent her entire career working keep families and children safe. She has cosponsored the bipartisan EARN IT Act protect children online, and her federal legislation to help train law enforcement to identify and prevent child trafficking and to combat human trafficking activity on social media was signed into law.

The House must block this dangerous bill before it's too late.\"\n\nAs the ACLU and a wide array of civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy organizations have repeatedly explained, this bill would not keep kids safe, but instead threaten young people's privacy, limit minors' access to vital resources, and silence important online conversations for all ages. The ACLU has also raised concerns about how this bill could be used to limit adults' ability to express themselves freely online or access diverse viewpoints.\n\nThe ACLU is also worried that the government's attempts to regulate select design features will implicate First Amendment-protected speech. If passed, this legislation would require online platforms that minors are likely to use to take steps to prevent harm. While the revised duty of care requirement supposedly regulates \"design features\" instead of speech, the list of \"design features\" are defined so broadly that platforms are likely to censor content that could prove objectionable to the government, which could include anything from sexual health resources to information about gender identity, or how to get help for an eating disorder.\n\nThis vote comes just days after the ACLU led more than 300 students in a lobbying day on Capitol Hill in opposition to the bill.\n\n\"It's called the Kids Online Safety Act, but they have to consider kids' voices, and some of us don't think it will make us safer,\" said Anjali Verma, a 17-year-old rising high school senior. \"We live on the internet, and we are afraid that important information we've accessed all our lives will no longer be available.

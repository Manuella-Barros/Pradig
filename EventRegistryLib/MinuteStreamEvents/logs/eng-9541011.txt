Anthony Edwards powered the Timberwolves' offense in historic fashion with another 40-bomb. Defensively, Minnesota stymied Denver in ways no other team in the Association can. Rudy Gobert disrupted two-time MVP Nikola Jokic by both defending him on-ball and roaming off-ball as a helper.\n\nThe Timberwolves got strong second-half performances from Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid as the two aided Edwards offensively and matched up with Jokic when Gobert wasn't his primary defender. Ant, Jaden McDaniels and Nickeil Alexander-Walker limited Jamal Murray, who scored just 17 points in the series opener.\n\nIt's no surprise that Tim Connelly, the Timberwolves' president of basketball operations, has emphasized length, size and defense in a majority of his moves in Minnesota. As the former GM of the Nuggets, he knew what storm was brewing in Denver and the sheer talent of the Joker. While his trade for Gobert was met with heavy criticism, it's clear Connelly had a plan.\n\nAfter the Wolves' impressive Game 1 win, media asked Gobert if he felt Minnesota was built specifically to counter Denver. Gobert's answer didn't necessarily answer that specific question, but it did point to Minnesota's internal confidence. The Wolves feel it's their moment and, so far, they're not wrong.\n\nRudy Gobert shares confidence in Timberwolves\n\n\"I think it's about us. Obviously, we truly believe that Denver is one of the top teams in this league. But we believe in our abilities. We believe in what we've been building and we believe in our goal, which is to win a championship. Obviously, I have a lot of respect for Denver, what they've accomplished in the last year and even this year, the season that they've had. But we think that we are pretty unique. It's on us to bring the mindset every day, every night and just to give our best. Like I said, may the best win. But we're really trying to embrace our moment.\"\n\nSince arriving from the Utah Jazz, the Timberwolves' anchor has brought an attitude with one goal on mind. That goal is to bring the Larry O'Brien Trophy to Minnesota. All season long, the multi-time Defensive Player of the Year has held himself and his teammates accountable. At times, Gobert has been visibly upset when a defensive rotation is missed or a poor closeout leads to an uncontested dunk.\n\nHowever, as a result of his high expectations for the unit, the others have responded. Not only did the Timberwolves rank as the top defense in the league all season long, their focus and defensive intensity have carried into the postseason. Minnesota is now 5-0 since the beginning of the NBA Playoffs after a sweep of the Phoenix Suns and an impressive road win to start Round 2.\n\nIn those five games, the Timberwolves have held their opponent to sub-100 points three times. With the opportunity to intensely game plan for each series, the Minnesota's defense has gotten even better with Gobert leading the way. The Wolves star has held this level of confidence all season long. Even before the All-Star break, Gobert mentioned the improvements the team can make by the time they are in the NBA Finals.\n\nFrom his comments following the series opener, it's clear Minnesota internally feels like the team to beat this postseason. The job isn't finished though. Denver will look to bounce back in Game 2, but Minnesota has stolen home court and has a chance to pull the rug out from under the Nuggets if they steal both games on the road to start the series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sheldon_wohlman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Sheldon Wohlman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickeil_Alexander-Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nickeil Alexander-Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Connelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Connelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Gobert-shares-confident-approach-after-Game-1-win-over-Nuggets.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541011", "eventUri": "eng-9541011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Edwards has also often shared that the key to the Wolves' success can be simple as trusting Rudy Gobert to anchor the defense.\n\nMike Conley has compared Edwards to a young Michael Jordan. Coach Chris Finch will often highlight different players -- starters or role players -- when he's felt their performance was worthy of recognition if it otherwise might not have been a talking point.\n\nThroughout the season, the Timberwolves haven't been shy about giving each other their flowers. That's a sentiment Gobert expounded upon when talking with reporters following the Timberwolves' 106-99 Game 1 victory over the Denver Nuggets Saturday in Denver.\n\nGobert explained how the adversity the team faced last season made the Timberwolves more resilient. They built trust, they learned how to play together, they overcame injuries, and now, all the pieces are coming together as the Timberwolves remain unbeaten in these playoffs.\n\n\"I really think I've never been part of a group that understands each other, that cares about one another and wants to see each other shine,\" Gobert said. \"In this league, it's not something that you find very often. I love going to battle every night with the guys. I'm really having a lot of fun.\"\n\nGobert didn't light up the stat sheet offensively with just six points in Game 1, but four of those game in the biggest moments of the contest. Gobert made a tip-in shot with 3 minutes, 13 seconds remaining in the game that put the Timberwolves up 96-91.\n\nThen Gobert made a jumper off the glass with 2 minutes, 15 seconds remaining that put Minnesota up 100-91. He also had 13 rebounds, three assists, three blocks and a steal, turning in an effort defensively that was key to the Minnesota victory.\n\nMeanwhile, Edwards set a playoff career high with 43 points. Towns scored 20 despite battling foul trouble. Naz Reid contributed 16 points off the bench and made key shot after key shot down the stretch. Conley hit some big shots, too, and finished with 14 points and 10 assists.\n\nAs brilliant as Edwards was Saturday night, it wasn't all him, and the Timberwolves turned in a great all-around effort to steal home court and Game 1 from the defending champion Nuggets.

Gobert honestly said that he had never been a part of such a loving locker room, calling it a very rare thing to find in the modern NBA.\n\n\"We're overcoming adversity. I don't think it's something that started this year, it started last year. All we've been through individually and as a team, it made us more resilient and build that trust in one another. I've never been part of a group that understands each other, that cares about each other and wants to see each other shine. In this league, it's not something that you find very often.\"\n\nGobert spent nine seasons with the Utah Jazz, emerging as the league's best defensive center during this stint. He won three Defensive Player of the Year awards in Utah and is expected to pick up his fourth this season with the Wolves, tied for most in history. Gobert averaged 14.0 points, 12.9 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks this season.\n\nThe French center did not get along with his Jazz co-star Donovan Mitchell, whose relationship went downhill after Gobert took COVID-19 to be a joke and became the player whose positive test forced the league to shut down.\n\nThe only other player alongside Gobert to be infected was Donovan Mitchell, which led to an awkward partnership for a couple of seasons after that until the Jazz traded both players away.\n\nRudy Gobert Has Taken His Time To Settle In\n\nGobert joined the Timberwolves in the offseason of 2022, being traded by the Utah Jazz for a haul of assets. The media mocked the Wolves for the deal due to Gobert's inflated salary, tough fit alongside Karl-Anthony Towns, and Gobert's generally ineffective offensive game or perimeter defense.\n\nAs Gobert played through a back injury, the Wolves barely snuck into the 2023 Playoffs and lost 4-1 in the first round. Many declared the Wolves to have already lost the trade because of the failed season, but this year they've come back with a vengeance. They already swept the first round and beat the Phoenix Suns, remaining undefeated in the Playoffs after picking up a Game 1 win over the Nuggets.\n\nThe Wolves are built to stop the defending champions and would be a near-guarantee to make the NBA Finals if they can beat the Nuggets. It'd be their first Finals appearance in franchise history.\n\nThey've been to only one Western Conference Finals in their entire franchise history, a feat that Anthony Edwards and Co. could replicate now, if not take it further. Beating the Nuggets over a 7-game series will not be easy, but the Wolves might bet the best-placed to pull this off.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjMxNzc5OTI3OTI1ODU5/usatsi_20286352.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541011", "eventUri": "eng-9541011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Gobert's move proves the Jazz duo breakup was the right choice as he thrives in Minnesota's defensive-minded team. The Timberwolves' league-best defense faces a tough test versus the Nuggets. Gobert's matchup against Joki\u0107 is key.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves' exceptional regular season performance has translated seamless to the postseason. While the story of the Timberwolves' dominant sweep of the Phoenix Suns was the heroics of rising superstar Anthony Edwards, who is cementing himself as one of the league's best players, most expected greatness from the former first overall pick.\n\nWhile Edwards has showcased his ability to be a number one option all season and into the playoffs, it has been the stifling defense and added involvement of Rudy Gobert that has elevated Minnesota to new heights this year. Despite being a three-time Defensive Player of the Year with a fourth likely on its way, Gobert has seemingly never gotten respect from his peers as a true defensive force due the perimiter-centric nature of the NBA Playoffs, where his rim protection is less of a threat and has even looked like a liability in past postseasons.\n\nGobert's tenure with the Timberwolves, especially recently, has indicated that the 7-foot-1 big man wasn't the core problem during his postseason runs with his former team, the Utah Jazz; rather, it was the lack of legitamate perimeter defenders around him. Considering Minnesota boasts the league's lockdown defense - which has continued into the playoffs, it's hard to argue that Gobert has had anything but a positive impact during the Timberwolves' best season since 2004.\n\nJazz Were So Close, Yet So Far From Success Utah made the postseason every year Donovan Mitchell and Gobert played together\n\nThe Jazz knew they had drafted a star in Louisville's Donovan Mitchell almost immediately after he burst onto the scene in 2017. The explosive guard nearly captured Rookie of the Year honors, but importantly, ended Utah's four-year postseason drought.\n\nDespite being a predictable first-round exit led by a 21-year-old, the Jazz continued to experiment and tweak their roster over the course of the next four seasons around Mitchell and Gobert, who eventually established themselves as one of the league's best on-court duos. The Jazz alternated between first and second-round playoff exits, despite routinely floating around 50 wins.\n\nDonovan Mitchell & Rudy Gobert Statistics as Teammates (2017-2022)\n\nCategory\n\nMitchell\n\nGobert\n\nPPG\n\n23.9\n\n14.9\n\nTS%\n\n55.5%\n\n69.1%\n\nWin Shares\n\n29.0\n\n56.1\n\nIt wasn't until Utah made the savvy additions of veteran point guard Mike Conley and sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 that the Jazz truly began to hit their stride as one of the NBA's premier teams. With more offensive firepower and a starting lineup that routinely oblierated defenses, the Jazz were able to lock down the Western Conference's top seed in 2020-21.\n\nDespite being granted the perfect opportunity to take the franchise to its first Conference Finals since 2007 against an injury-riddled Los Angeles Clippers squad missing Kawhi Leonard, the Jazz faltered in an embarassing six-game defeat. This would evidently be the peak of the Mitchell-Gobert experience, as Utah again fell in the first round after running back the previous year's roster with minimal changes.\n\nOnce a budding duo with plenty of promise, Jazz brass knew it was time to break up their core amid reported tension between their stars and consecutive underwhelming playoff appearances. During this uncertaintly, it wasn't known if the Jazz would move on from one or both of Mitchell and Gobert. Regardless, much of the blame was directed at Gobert, an easier target considering he would be forced to watch from the sidelines at times late in games if the opponent went small.\n\nGobert's ensuing move to Minnesota would show that he wasn't unplayable, but that he simply wasn't capable for covering up for his teammate's subpar defensive effort and abilities. With an aging Mike Conley and and Royce O'Neale as his only positive defensive help, Gobert was oftentimes left covering up for his perimiter teammates getting blown by, looking out of position as a result.\n\nTimberwolves' Gamble on Gobert Paying Off Minnesota has put their big man in a position to succeed, unlike his previous team\n\nWhen Minnesota readily shipped away multiple first-round picks to land Gobert, there was understandable confusing considering the team already had a franchise center in Karl-Anthony Towns. Considering the intial results of this experiment and the relative success of Utah's newest young center, Walker Kessler, who was brought in to the deal, the negative feedback was warranted.\n\nHowever, in hindsight, it seems the shortcomings of the 2022-23 Timberwolves came down to an injury-plagued roster and the tall task of figuring out how to balance the talents of two All-NBA centers.\n\nGobert and defensive stud Jaden McDaniels, along with 2024 Sixth Man of the Year, Naz Reid, kept Minnesota's frontcourt in tact after Towns went down with a torn mensicus midseason. Mike Conley has also proven to still be effective after joining Gobert in Minnesota, even as his role continues to diminish. Edwards has turned the corner from rising star to established superstar.\n\nEven journeyman Kyle Anderson and Nickeil Alexander-Walker have turned in productive and effective performances in the regular season and playoffs. Most importantly, every single one of Gobert's new teammates gives a more concentrated and effective effort on defense - a luxury he never had while with the Jazz.\n\n2021-22 Jazz Defense vs. 2023-24 Timberwolves Defense\n\nCategory\n\nJazz\n\nTimberwolves\n\nDRTG\n\n110.0\n\n108.4\n\nOpponent Points in Paint\n\n45.3\n\n46.1\n\nSPG\n\n7.2\n\n7.9\n\nWith the Timberwolves looking like a true contender through the first round of the playoffs, narratives will continue to be formed surrounding both individuals and the cohesion of their unorthodox roster.\n\nMinnesota's league-best defense will have its hardest test yet when they face the reigning-champion Denver Nuggets in the second round, as Denver provides much tougher matchups than Phoenix posed. Chief among them is two-time MVP Nikola Joki\u0107, who has dealt Gobert a heavy dose of his offensive wizardry in the past.\n\nGobert's defensive performance against Joki\u0107 will likely be one of the series' main talking points, while also providing Gobert with the opportunity to change his postseason reputation.\n\nEven if Minnesota does succumb to the Nuggets, a powerhouse in their own right, the season should be viewed as a success for the franchise. It has become clear that Gobert can find success with a roster built around his strengths, while his effectiveness can also be attributed to having teammates that trust him more on both sides of the ball.\n\nWith an Edwards extension looming and two centers set to make north of $50 million annually, the Timberwolves may have to make some tough financial decisions sooner rather than later. After this year, though, Gobert has seemingly proven himself over Towns as the more essential asset for a contending team.\n\nRelated Rudy Gobert's Redemption Arc is Well Underway The three-time

Gobert posted a picture of him and his girlfriend to social media in February announcing they were expecting a child. The Wolves lead the best-of-seven series. 1-0.\n\nDuring a road trip in Utah in March, Gobert was asked if he would consider missing a playoff game to be there for his child's birth. Without hesitation, he said he would.\n\n\"I don't think there's any debate to have,\" Gobert said then. \"Coach [Chris] Finch and every guy in this room - that's what I really love about our team, we have a level of human connection and empathy for one another that's really good. I think all the guys will literally tell me, don't play.\"\n\nThe Wolves were preparing on Monday as if Gobert would not be there for Game 2. His potential absence would alter how the Wolves defend the Nuggets. They prefer to play one of Naz Reid, Karl-Anthony Towns or Kyle Anderson one-on-one on Denver center Nikola Jokic with Gobert able to roam the paint while playing off forward Aaron Gordon, who struggles to shoot from the outside.\n\n\"It definitely changes things,\" point guard Mike Conley said of Gobert's potential absence. \"He's a big focal point of what we do, especially defensively. Also, offensively as well, but we're a deep team and we got a lot of guys ready to step in and play for us if that's the case, and just try to get a win by any means.\"\n\nConley referenced the Wolves might have to throw some \"junk\" defenses at Jokic to switch up the looks they are giving him. Without Gobert, the Wolves might opt for more double teams on Jokic and scramble around to cover Denver's open shooters. It was a strategy the Wolves deployed in a March 19 loss to Denver at Target Center. The Wolves were without Gobert, Towns and Reid for that game and still almost pulled out the game in a 115-112 loss.\n\n\"Going forward, all of us have different tools that we bring to the team, and I believe in everyone of my teammates to step up,\" guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker said. \"All season we've been playing a few games short handed, we've had a few injuries.

Gobert was not seen on the court during the portion of Minnesota's pregame shootaround that was open to media.\n\nAccording to The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Gobert said earlier this season that he would miss a potential playoff game to be present for the birth of his child. He posted a photo on social media announcing he and his girlfriend were expecting a child on Feb. 21.\n\nThe focal point of Minnesota's league-leading defense, Gobert is widely expected to win his fourth career NBA Defensive Player of the Year crown this season. The award will be announced Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. MT.\n\nGobert has been instrumental in the Timberwolves' defensive scheme against Nuggets center Nikola Jokic despite not being the primary one-on-one matchup for Jokic. Minnesota puts Karl-Anthony Towns on the two-time MVP while Gobert roams as a free safety of sorts, converging on Jokic when necessary but also monitoring the lethal alley-oop connection to Aaron Gordon, who lurks on the baseline for easy buckets in Denver's offense.\n\nWithout Gobert, the Timberwolves can still use two centers in their starting lineup. NBA Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid filled in while Towns was injured late in the regular season, keeping the Timberwolves steady near the top of the Western Conference standings. And in their Game 1 win against the Nuggets, Reid scored 14 points in the fourth quarter, including 10 in the last six minutes.\n\nPeyton Watson registered four blocks against Reid while matched up against the backup center April 10 when Denver won its final regular-season meeting with Minnesota. The 21-year-old Watson only played 5:30 in Game 1 of the playoff series, as coach Michael Malone opted for a bench lineup that prioritized offense after the Nuggets scored only four points in the first seven minutes of the series. But if Reid becomes a bigger factor in the second game and Denver requires more defensive versatility, the matchup may call for more of Watson, a shot-blocking wing who has studied Minnesota's Jaden McDaniels as a comparable player.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bennett_durando@denverpost.com", "name": "Bennett Durando", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-L-NUGGETS-WOLVESAO1_4438xxx.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541011", "eventUri": "eng-9541011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-21", "textStart": 515, "textEnd": 522}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 1655, "textEnd": 1663}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Rudy Gobert could miss Monday's matchup.\n\nThe favorite to win his fourth Defensive Player of the Year Award is listed as questionable due to personal reasons, according to Timberwolves PR X account. Gobert and his girlfriend are expecting a baby, which could explain the potential absence.\n\nAs the team sends its well-wishes to the French center, supporting players like Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels and Nickeil Alexander-Walker are also preparing themselves for a bigger workload on the defensive end. Nikola Jokic might not need the clone machine on this night.\n\nBut everyone discounts Minnesota at its own peril. This squad is tougher and deeper than people originally anticipated. Anthony Edwards is the Wolves' unquestioned top guy, but the rest of the team is rallying around him. When Karl-Anthony Towns suffered a meniscus injury in March, Chris Finch's group collectively stepped up and earned a 12-6 record in that span.\n\nWith Finch physically limited and Gobert possibly out of action for Game 2, the Timberwolves must dig deep again. That might not be a problem, though, judging by the intensity and chemistry they have displayed throughout these NBA Playoffs. Another win in Ball Arena could position this franchise for the greatest run of its almost-35-year existence.\n\nTimberwolves can take a commanding lead vs. Nuggets\n\nDenver's game plan could change depending on the final status of Rudy Gobert, but its sense of urgency will be sky-high regardless. Although the defending champions have done an excellent job at weathering turbulence this season, dropping two games at home against this hungry foe would feel like a death sentence.\n\nSure, Jokic could plausibly force his hand though the ground and come back from the dead, but Minnesota would also have to be sloppy gravediggers to provide such an opening. And based on how the team is looking right now, such incompetence seems unlikely.\n\nBefore fans can experience being up 2-0, however, the Timberwolves actually have to win Game 2. They must draw on the unflappable composure they embodied in Saturday's 106-99 victory. Anthony Edwards solidified his superstar status with a magnificent all-around performance, scoring 43 points on 17-of-29 shooting.

Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDraymond Green has had a long-standing beef with Rudy Gobert. However, the Golden State Warriors forward caught the basketball community by surprise after he complimented Gobert following the Minnesota Timberwolves sweeping the Phoenix Suns. Yet just a few days after the pleasantly surprising comments, Green decided to attack the Frenchman's career by highlighting that his impact on the court was yet to amount to an NBA championship.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves took the basketball world by storm after sweeping the Phoenix Suns in the first round. While Anthony Edwards was Chris Finch's best player in the series, Rudy Gobert being the anchor of the exceptional defensive unit also played a huge role in the 4-0 win. Reacting to it, Draymond Green was among the many personalities to shower Rudy with lofty praise.\n\nTaking to his podcast, The Draymond Green Show, the Warriors leader gave a backhanded compliment to the three-time Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n\"Rudy actually not trash anymore. He defends now. And ironically, when you see him on the switches, he's up at the level, he not just sitting back and a drop no more. When he gets switched on to the guy, it's like his antennas pop on. He is actually impacting winning and he's actually doing that on the defensive end,\" Green said.\n\nDespite all the (not so) subtle shade that Dray was throwing disguised as compliments, it was heartwarming to see him give Gobert the recognition he deserved. However, it didn't take the four-time All-Star to show his true colors. Just a few days later, Green went back to criticizing his rival. Replying to an Instagram post that consisted of his clip, praising the Wolves star, he wrote:\n\n\"Your favorite player hasn't won\"\n\nRudy Gobert is one of the greatest defensive players in the modern NBA. However, he's often ripped apart for having no titles or any significant run in the postseason. This season, after already clinching a Game 1 win over the Denver Nuggets, the European has the opportunity to make a push for the championship and silence his detractors.\n\nIt almost felt as though Green was trying to squash his beef with Gobert. However, given their history, simple praise for a four-game stretch doesn't seem enough to create peace between the two, especially given the scuffle that took place between the two, not too long ago.\n\nThe Draymond Green-Rudy Gobert rivalry began in 2017 when the two players were in contention to win the Defensive Player of the Year award. Over the years, both have tried belittling the other through interviews and social media. However, things really became intense this campaign when their beef went from verbal altercations to something physical.\n\nDuring the 14 November clash between the Golden State Warriors and the Minnesota Timberwolves, a full-fledged brawl occurred within a few minutes after tip-off. During the same incident, Green intervened before dangerously putting Gobert in a headlock.\n\nAs expected, Green was ejected from the contest. Eventually, the league decided to penalize the eight-time All-Defensive player for his behavior with an indefinite suspension. Right after the details of the suspension were released, Rudy Gobert reacted to the news by saying the following.\n\n\"I have empathy for him. You see somebody that's not well inside and suffering. You take away the game and all that, and you want somebody to be well and be able to do what we do every night and compete and be happy,\" Gobert said to Tim MacMahon of ESPN.\n\nDespite beefing with Green for almost seven years, it was heartwarming to learn that Gobert wanted the former to use the indefinite suspension productively. That said, it doesn't seem to have benefitted their relationship much at all.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_\u0160ari\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dario \u0160ari\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Communities", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Communities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Auction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Auction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/43c589ca-untitled-design-2024-05-06t153549.722.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541011", "eventUri": "eng-9541011", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-14", "textStart": 2978, "textEnd": 2989}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He spearheaded the Timberwolves' charge with a formidable 43-point performance, shooting 17-of-29 and showcasing tenacious defense.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns contributed 20 points on an efficient 8-of/13 shooting, while Naz Reid provided a solid boost off the bench with 16 points in 23 minutes of play. Veteran guard Mike Conley also made his presence felt, with 14 points and a game-leading 10 assists.\n\nMinnesota demonstrated dominance in both rebounding, outpacing the Nuggets by eight boards and scoring in the paint, boasting a 10-point advantage in that department.\n\nDespite Nikola Jokic's impressive performance, he grappled with the imposing presence and physicality of Towns and Gobert throughout the game. Jamal Murray also faced difficulties in finding scoring opportunities against the defensive prowess of McDaniels and Edwards.\n\nMinnesota's defensive effort remained stellar throughout the contest, limiting the Nuggets' offensive output.\n\nHowever, McDaniels struggled to make an impact offensively, going scoreless and shooting 0-7. To secure victory, the Timberwolves will rely on McDaniels to regain his scoring rhythm and contribute points effectively.\n\nNickeil Alexander-Walker experienced a dip in his offensive performance compared to his standout play in the Suns series, only managing five points while shooting 2-of-6.\n\nThe Timberwolves' 14 turnovers proved costly, as the Nuggets capitalised on them, converting them into 18 points. To turn the tide and potentially seize homecourt advantage in Game 2, Minnesota must prioritise ball security and minimise turnovers.\n\nWhat happened to Rudy Gobert?\n\nRudy Gobert has been a consistent presence for most of the season, participating in 76 games and only missing six.\n\nNotably, he sat out three consecutive games due to a left rib injury, coinciding with matchups against the Utah Jazz in back-to-back games on March 16 and 18, as well as against the Denver Nuggets on March 19.\n\nThe former Defensive Player of the Year winner narrowly avoided a serious injury during the March 12 game against the LA Clippers.

It was a contest where only NBA players could cast votes. Many were disappointed by the poll, including Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, as Gobert is known as an elite defensive player.\n\nIn the modern NBA, the league has been in hot waters with the veterans for not valuing defense as much as offense in games. As Charles Barkley came on as a guest on Shannon Sharpe's podcast, the retired star revealed the reason behind Rudy Gobert's votes.\n\nBarkley stated that the NBA and broadcasting networks do not televise defensive highlights of players and only focus on offense. Sharpe added to the topic by stating that this was the 'offensive era.' The league does not want to show the aggressive side of players, which usually occurs during defensive plays.\n\nGobert has won the Defensive Player of the Year award three times in his career. The star is one of the best defenders in the current NBA, resulting in a big contract for the Frenchman. The Timberwolves center has also remained a huge help in the team's journey for the second round of playoffs. Hence, fans believed the hatred towards the athlete by his peers was far-fetched during voting.\n\nRudy Gobert is not bothered by getting voted overrated\n\nGobert is having a great season, as the star is averaging double-doubles with 2.1 blocks per game. Considering the player's stats and dominance on the opposite side of the court, the result of the poll became slightly puzzling. However, Gobert is not bothered by votes on his name.\n\nWhile speaking with ESPN's Tim MacMahon, Gobert echoed Barkley's opinion. The 31-year-old stated that the players did not have respect for his way of playing and simply remained jealous of his achievements.\n\nStrangely enough, the star was also on the list of best defensive players voted by NBA players. The center's lack of offense seems to be the problem for his peers. Nevertheless, it is hard to deny the star's skills at protecting the rim. The French player will likely win the DPOY award again this year as he is among the top contenders.\n\nIn Case You Missed It:", "source": {"uri": "firstsportz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FirstSportz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Sharpe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Sharpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills_and_Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills and Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rudy-Gobert-Charles-Barkley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541011", "eventUri": "eng-9541011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Yes, the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Clippers flamed due to injuries, the Phoenix Suns emphasized the mistakes of building superteams, and LeBron James may enter free agency. But those are all storylines that can wait until the offseason.\n\nThese playoffs have been dictated by two physical defenses upsetting preseason contenders, the Minnesota Timberwolves and the New York Knicks leaning into the physical nature of postseason basketball.\n\nBoth face unique tests in these conference semifinals, the Timberwolves facing the best player in the world and the Knicks meeting a whirlwind offense. Just how good have these defenses been? Better than you may have realized...\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves' defense is known and praised by now. Even if presumptive four-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert misses Game 2 for the birth of his child, Minnesota should make life difficult for the Denver Nuggets.\n\nOn paper, the Timberwolves' defense has not dialed it up in the playoffs. Its season-long rating of 108.9 was No. 1 in the NBA. From Jan. 1 to the end of the regular season, it rated at 108.6. After the All-Star Break, it came in at 108.8. And in five playoff games thus far, Minnesota's defensive rating has been 108.9.\n\nThink about that for a moment.\n\nThe Timberwolves faced the Phoenix Suns, who had a big three of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal -- who finished the regular season with an offensive rating of 116.8 -- and held them to an offensive rating of 109.3 in a four-game sweep.\n\nA two-bucket dropoff per 100 possessions is how you turn a team designed around its offense into an offseason mess. If Minnesota does that to Denver (season offensive rating of 117.8, but 107.6 in Game 1), this series may end just as quickly, though now with a possible Game 2 anomaly without Gobert.\n\nOn paper, the New York Knicks' defense has also eased up in the playoffs. Since trading for O.G. Anunoby on New Year's, New York's defensive rating ranked No. 3 to close the regular season at 110.3. Anunoby was in and out of the lineup, but that defensive rating largely held, ranking No. 4 at 109.5 from March 1 to the season's end.\n\nBut in six playoff games against the Philadelphia 76ers, the Knicks' defensive rating was 116.9.\n\nThis gets more difficult to perfectly quantify, given Joel Embiid's injury-interrupted season, but per statmuse, the 76ers' offensive rating with Embiid this season was 122.4.\n\nThat makes sense, given it ranked No. 2 (121.5) in the NBA up until Dec. 23, when his injuries began picking up steam after playing in 25 of the season's first 28 games. Even through Jan. 25, when Embiid was forced to the sideline up until April after playing in 33 of 43 games, Philadelphia's offensive rating was 119.7.\n\nBut in those six games in the first round, all obviously with Embiid, it fell to 116.9. Again, that is effectively two buckets. If New York does that to Indiana (No. 2 offensive rating in the regular season at 120.5), the Knicks can begin thinking about a matchup with the best offense in the NBA in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe six-game sample size may worry you, but Tom Thibodeau is not going to change his approach in the second round. Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart will play nearly every minute. Mitchell Robinson and Isaiah Hartenstein will provide a surprising interior defense. O.G. Anunoby will quarterback the entire defensive effort.\n\nIgnoring the sample-size worry allows you to find value before oddsmakers catch all the way onto this New York defense. Expect it to slow down Indiana tonight and force a few more bad looks than usual. For that matter, add the Madison Square Garden crowd as a sixth defender, its second-round atmosphere perhaps getting under the young Pacers' skin a bit.\n\nRudy Gobert's possible absence tonight emphasizes two best bets already published in my Timberwolves vs. Nuggets predictions. First of all, Karl-Anthony Towns may be in line for a few more minutes, further emphasizing his offensive impact.\n\nThe Nuggets have no choice but to load up on Anthony Edwards after he exposed their defense in Game 1. Any focus on Edwards will lead to mismatches in Towns's favor, and KAT hardly needs mismatches to score, anyway. That was how he poured in 11 points in the first four minutes of Saturday's second half.\n\nEven if Gobert plays, Towns should see more open looks than usual for the best-shooting big man in NBA history.\n\nSecondly, Nikola Jokic already needs to pick up some offensive slack while Jamal Murray fights a nagging calf. That work will be only easier for Jokic if Gobert is not roaming the backline.\n\nBest bet: Karl-Anthony Towns Over 19.5 points (-105 at DraftKings after the Gobert update) and Nikola Jokic Over 29.5 points (-110 at BetMGM after the Gobert update)\n\nSix Unders cashed in the eight first-round Game 1s. Include Game 1 of the Timberwolves vs. Nuggets, and Game 1s have now cashed seven Unders in nine games.\n\nGames 2 through 4 in the first round then split perfectly evenly, 12 Overs and 12 Unders. Games 5 through 7 skewed heavily toward their Overs, with eight cashing in 11 games.\n\nThis makes some ounce of sense, teams beginning each series with a more exploratory thought, trying to feel out their opponent's approach. And then, as the series progresses, players find rhythms.\n\nKeep an eye on this tonight, and if Unders continue to hold up, perhaps act on it in both games on Tuesday.\n\nIf you enjoy competitive basketball, become a fan of the Western Conference. Looking at series spread props, both conference semifinals are expected to go seven games.\n\nMeanwhile, the Eastern Conference will be lucky to have one series make it to six games, with Pacers vs. Knicks obviously more likely in that consideration. Some of that is a credit to New York's defense and Boston's dominance.

The 26 year-old revealed that he had been working on the knockout shot with his trainer \u2013 former three-weight world champion Ricky Burns \u2013 prior to the fight in his camp in Scotland. \u201cAll those months of training for that,\u201d joke McGivern after finishing the fight within five-and-a-half minutes. \u201cWe worked on that punch in the gym time and time again, we worked on holding my feet a bit more and not being as bouncy and not being as far away. \u201cThe first round I was sort of figuring out what he wanted to do then I sort of settled down to my own rhythm planted my feet and let the shots go a bit more. \u201cThe first couple of shouts in the first round was to put him off and not let him get too much confidence, then he came out and tried to throw a bit more, so I started to let shots go and it paid off. \u201cThat is the first time that I have really knocked out someone cold, there was one in Dublin but that one was convincing. \u201cI have been working in the gym with Ricky, sitting down more, historically everyone knows I\u2019m a counter-puncher and I work on my back foot and away. \u201cMe and Ricky worked in the gym on staying solid on my feet and punching harder.\u201d McGivern has only been with Burns a couple of weeks and is already seeing the dividends paying off. \u201cThe two weeks made a difference, being in that environment in a training camp where you are only there to train,\u201d said McGivern. \u201cIt was in a wee apartment in Airdrie and there was nothing to do around the place, I was literally just there to train, and I was just focused on trained.\u201d McGivern wants to pen a deal with Queensberry Promotions and get bigger fights. \u201cI was saying at ringside Frank may get the contract signed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat more can you do? \"Maybe let it go another couple of rounds so I could show off a bit but I\u2019m happy. \u201cHopefully I now put pen to paper with Queensberry, hopefully that was good enough for them or not...I think it is, hopefully I sign with them and that is me in the big time. \u201cBritish, Commonwealth, European (titles), maybe look at something like that soon.\u201d The 12-fight card also featured Belfast\u2019s Colm Murphy and Conor Quinn \u2013 the latter on his Queensberry stable debut and sharing top billing for the clash with Conner Kelsall to win the vacant Commonwealth flyweight championship. The Republic of Ireland\u2019s Pierce O\u2019Leary was the other headline fight on his fourth defence of the WBC International super-lightweight title when up against Darragh Foley. Murphy had his sights on the vacant Commonwealth Silver featherweight title.", "summary": "\u200bBelfast fighter James McGivern is hoping his sensational knockout of Rashid Omar at the SSE Arena last night will earn him a contract with Frank Warren\u2019s Queensbury stable.", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/boxing/northern-irelands-james-mcgivern-wants-frank-warren-spot-after-belfast-brawl-success-4684407", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmZiMDE2YzgwLTc2OTUtNGQ4Ni1iZjFmLTg0Y2Q4YTRkZDYwYzplMGEwYmRiMi1mYTYzLTRhMzAtOGNjMS1hNzBhYjgxYzNmNWY=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:25:24", "author": "Ciaran Donaghy", "authors": ["Ciaran Donaghy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.46}

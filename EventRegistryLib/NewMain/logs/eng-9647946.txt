The news was reported by his hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle.\n\nJames was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014. BMI named him one of its Songwriters of the Century in 2000, citing the three aforementioned tracks as appearing on a list of the 100 greatest songs of the 20th century.\n\nJames won two Grammys, both in 1983 for \"Always on My Mind,\" which he shared with co-writers Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher. It won both Song of the Year and Country Song of the Year after being recorded by Willie Nelson, who took it to No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Songs chart country. It was previously recorded by - and is often associated with - Elvis Presley, although his 1972 version was not a major hit at the time in the United States, having been released as Elvis' B-side. A Pet Shop Boys cover was arguably as successful internationally as Nelson's, reaching number one in the UK and number four in the US. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nJames had many of his biggest hits with Presley's recordings. \"Suspicious Minds,\" which was a solo composition by James, remains one of the King's signature songs. James was actually the first to record it, when he was trying to launch his own recording career in 1968. But in 1969, Presley had his last No. 1 song with it. It was later remade by Fine Young Cannibals, which was a UK top 10 hit in 1986.\n\nPresley also recorded \"Moody Blue,\" the title track from his final album, along with \"It's Only Love\" and \"Raised on Rock.\"\n\n\"Always on My Mind\" and \"Suspicious Minds\" weren't the only James songs to become hits in different decades. \"Hooked on a Feeling\" went to No. 5 for BJ Thomas in 1969. Five years later, Blue Swede's version - with its incongruous \"ooga-chaka\" addition - reached No. 1. Just this year, the Hives did a cover of \"Hooked\" for Spotify, keeping the Blue Swede vocals.\n\n\"Hooked on a Feeling\" was often licensed for films, from Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" to \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Suspicious Minds\" is perhaps the most important song in James' catalog, not only for what it did for his career, but for Presley's as well. The superstar was in crisis after his popularity waned in the wake of the British Invasion, but this anthem of romantic paranoia at least briefly made him seem relevant again to pop record buyers, and sparked a wave of appreciation that led to him becoming the biggest entertainer in Las Vegas until his death eight years later. It wasn't just songwriting that Presley had him to thank; the song's arrangement was closely modeled on one that James himself had recorded.\n\nSpeaking to The Wall Street Journal in 2012, James recalled the song's origins, appearing during a recording session for his own album with Chips Moman, who later introduced \"Suspicious Minds\" to Presley. \"Late at night, while messing around on my Fender guitar and using my Hammond organ pedals as a bass line, I came up with a catchy melody. I was married to my first wife by then, but I still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married in Houston. My wife suspected I was having these feelings, so it was a confusing time for me. I felt like all three of us were caught in this trap that we couldn't get out of.\n\nAlthough James left the Memphis sessions where Elvis was cutting the song, feeling uncomfortable having a stranger there, he later learned of Presley's appreciation. \"In the years that followed, every time I saw Elvis, he would walk across the room just to say hello, no matter who was with him. After he died, I heard that he was always asking the guys in the studio, \"Has Mark sent me any more songs?\" Damn, I wish I knew that. But his run of singles and album tracks with Presley was enviable.\n\nJames is also a member of the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2021, Sony/ATV Music Publishing announced that it had renewed its deal with James, renewing a contract that began 50 years earlier when he signed with Screen Gems/EMI.\n\nJames is survived by his wife of 53 years, Karen Zambon, his daughters Sammie and Dana Zambon, as well as his grandchildren and extended family. The family said in a statement: \"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack to lovers for generations. \"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_My_Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Always on My Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Songwriters Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooked_on_a_Feeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hooked on a Feeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UK Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Award for Song of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Christopher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Christopher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Carson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Carson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Swede", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Swede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pet Shop Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-side and B-side"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Music,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast Music, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willie Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody_Blue_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moody Blue (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Young_Cannibals", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fine Young Cannibals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Invasion", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hives", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nLegendary songwriter Mark James who wrote Elvis Presley's \"Suspicious Minds\" and \"Always on My Mind\" and BJ Thomas's \"Hooked on a Feeling\" has died aged 83.\n\nJames died in his home in Nashville on 8 June. The news was first reported by his hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle.\n\n\"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations,\" his family said in a statement.\n\n\"He was a captivating storyteller who had the sweetest smile, the most infectious laugh and a twinkle in his eye that never dimmed,\" they said.\n\nJames was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014, and in 2000 was named in BMI's list of the Songwriters of the Century, alongside Paul McCartney and Elton John. James also entered the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Always on My Mind,\" which he co-wrote with Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher, won James two Grammys for country song of the year and song of the year in 1983. The song was previously recorded by Elvis Presley in 1972, and released shortly after he separated from his wife Priscilla. However, it was released as a B-side track and didn't make too many waves.\n\nWillie Nelson's rerecording of the song in 1982, on the other hand, took \"Always on My Mind\" to the fifth spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top of the country songs chart, which then resulted in the Grammy wins.\n\nA synth-pop cover by the Pet Shop Boys in 1987, on a television show commemorating tenth anniversary of Presley's death, did so well that the duo released the song as a single, spending four weeks atop the UK's Christmas number-one chart.\n\n\"Always on My Mind\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nOver his career span, James's compositions were recorded several times by Presley. \"Suspicious Minds,\" \"Raised on Rock,\" \"It's Only Love\" and \"Moody Blue\" were all James's compositions.\n\nJames described \"Suspicious Minds\" as a \"sledgehammer\" in the Houston Chronicle in 2014, which was Presley's last No. 1 song before his death in 1977.\n\nJames had released it himself in 1968, trying to set up his own music career, but it was Presley's recording that really made it a hit.\n\n\"Late one night, fooling around on my Fender guitar and using my Hammond organ pedals for a bass line, I came up with a catchy melody. I was married to my first wife then but still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston,\" James told the Wall Street Journal about \"Suspicious Minds\" in 2012.\n\n\"My wife suspected I had those feelings, so it was a confusing time for me. I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\"\n\nA year later, Presley was told about the song, and reportedly went \"crazy about it\" when he heard it. \"He wanted to hear the song over and over again, and learned it on the spot,\" said producer Chips Moman.\n\nPresley not only recorded the song, but used almost the same arrangement to record his version.\n\n\"In the years that followed, whenever I saw Elvis, he'd cross the room just to say hello to me - no matter who was with him. After he died, I heard he'd always asked the guys in the studio, 'Did Mark send me any more songs?' Golly, I wish I had known that,\" James said.\n\nSeveral of James's songs have found popularity after other artists released covers. Swedish rock band Blue Swede hit No 1 with their version of \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in 1973. This cover was used in Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, and in the trailers and soundtrack of Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014.\n\nBorn Francis Zambon in Houston, Texas in 1940, James was teased in school because his father was a teacher and had to wear orthotics because of bad ankles.

As recently as this year, the Hives did a cover of \"Hooked,\" for Spotify, keeping the Blue Swede chant.\n\n\"Hooked on a Feeling\" was often licensed for films, from Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" to \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Suspicious Minds\" may be the most significant song in James' catalog, not just for what it did for his career, but for Presley's. The superstar had been in a slump after his popularity waned in the wake of the British Invasion, but this anthem of romantic paranoia at least briefly made him seem relevant again to pop record buyers, and kick-started a wave of appreciation that led to him becoming the biggest entertainer in Las Vegas through his death eight years later. It wasn't just the songwriting Presley had to thank him for; the arrangement of the song was closely modeled on the one James himself had recorded.\n\nTalking with the Wall Street Journal in 2012, James recalled the origins of the song, which came about during a recording session for his own album with Chips Moman, who went on to introduce \"Suspicious Minds\" to Presley. \"Late one night, fooling around on my Fender guitar and using my Hammond organ pedals for a bass line, I came up with a catchy melody. I was married to my first wife then but still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston. My wife suspected I had those feelings, so it was a confusing time for me. I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\"\n\nAlthough James left the Memphis sessions where Elvis was cutting the song, feeling there was discomfort at having a stranger there, he learned of Presley's appreciation later. \"In the years that followed, whenever I saw Elvis, he'd cross the room just to say hello to me -- no matter who was with him. After he died, I heard he'd always asked the guys in the studio, 'Did Mark send me any more songs?' Golly, I wish I had known that.\" But his run of both singles and album tracks with Presley was enviable.\n\nJames is also a member of the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2021, Sony/ATV Music Publishing announced that it had reupped its deal with James, renewing a contract that began 50 years earlier when he signed with Screen Gems/EMI.\n\nJames is survived by his wife of 53 years, Karen Zambon,his daughters Sammie and Dana Zambon, and grandchildren and extended family. The family said in a statement: \"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations.\"\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in June 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in June 2024\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

By 1959, he was performing locally and had recorded a single called Jive Note.\n\nHis career was put on hold when he was drafted into the army to fight in the Vietnam War.\n\nOn his return, he signed to a Memphis music publishing company, where he helped write songs for fellow Houston native BJ Thomas - including his breakout hit The Eyes Of A New York Woman.\n\nThe partnership also produced Hooked On A Feeling and It's Only Love, but James still had ambitions to become an artist in his own right.\n\nHe recorded his own version of Suspicious Minds in 1968, with the lyrics inspired by his own relationship. James was married but still had feelings for his childhood sweetheart - who was also married.\n\n\"It was a confusing time for me,\" he later told the Wall Street Journal. \"I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\"\n\nThe record label was confident that James's recording would be a smash, but it failed to chart.\n\nA year later, Elvis was booked into the studio where James worked, and the star was looking for new material to record. Suspicious Minds wa suggested, and the star went \"crazy about it\".\n\n\"He wanted to hear the song over and over again, and learned it on the spot,\" said producer Chips Moman.\n\nUsing almost exactly the same arrangement as James's original, Elvis took the song to number one in 1969 - rejuvenating his career.\n\nElvis would return to James for further hits, including It's Only Love, Moody Blue and Raised on Rock.\n\nBut perhaps their best-known collaboration is Always On My Mind.\n\nFirst recorded by Brenda Lee, then Gwen McCrae, the ballad was co-written by James alongside Johnny Christopher and Wayne Carson in 1971.\n\nElvis covered it two years later, initially issuing the song as the B-side of Separate Ways. In the UK, it was promoted to A-side status and reached number nine in the charts.\n\nSince then, it has been recorded by more than 300 other acts. Willie Nelson's version topped the US country charts in 1982, and earned James a Grammy Award for song of the year.\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys also covered it in 1987, turning the winsome melody into a hi-NRG disco stomper. It became a Christmas number one single in the UK, and was later named the best cover of all time in a poll conducted by the BBC.\n\nIt's not the only one of James's songs to be revived by a cover version. In 1974, Swedish group Blue Swede recorded a pop version of Hooked on a Feeling and scored a US number one.\n\nThe song gained another lease of life when it featured in Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs, and Blue Swede singer Bj\u00f6rn Skifs performed it at the opening of this year's Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo.\n\nJames's songs Sunday Sunrise and Raised on Rock have also been recorded by multiple artists, and the Fine Young Cannibals released a hit version of Suspicious Minds in 1986.\n\nThe musician continued to write hits throughout the 1970s, as well as releasing music with his own band, The Mark James Trio.\n\nIn later years, he became more interested in film scores, and studied the discipline at UCLA and the American Film Institute.

May he rest in peace.\n\nHis family said in a statement, \"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations.\" Per Variety, he is survived by his wife of 53 years, Karen Zambon, daughters Dana and Sammie, and grandchildren. A cause of death has not been shared yet.\n\nJames's legacy of iconic songs\n\nJames was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014 and named one of BMI's Songwriters of the Century in 2000. His song Always on My Mind, co-written with Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher, is particularly iconic and won two Grammy Awards in 1983. The song, recorded by Willie Nelson, also won both Song of the Year and Country Song of the Year.\n\n'Always on My Mind' and its remarkable resounding success\n\nIn addition to the Grammys, the song reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the country songs chart. The song was also associated with iconic American singer Elvis Presley, who had previously recorded it in 1972. A cover version by the Pet Shop Boys achieved international success, reaching No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the U.S., leading to its induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nJames's collaboration with Presley\n\nJames had several major successes with Presley recordings, including Suspicious Minds, a solo composition by James that became one of Presley's signature songs. First recorded by James in 1968, it became Presley's final No. 1 song in 1969. Other songs written by James and recorded by Presley include Moody Blue, It's Only Love, and Raised on Rock. Even though decades have passed, these melodies have not been marred by the ravages of time.\n\nThe origins of 'Suspicious Minds'\n\nIn a 2012 interview with the Wall Street Journal, James shared the origins of Suspicious Minds. He said, \"Late one night, fooling around on my Fender guitar and using my Hammond organ pedals for a bass line, I came up with a catchy melody.\" \"I was married to my first wife but still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston. My wife suspected I had those feelings, so it was a confusing time for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [{"uri":

James, a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, passed away at his Nashville home on June 8th, 2024, at the age of 83.\n\nJames' impact on music is undeniable. Songs like \"Always on My Mind,\" \"Suspicious Minds,\" and \"Hooked on a Feeling\" transcended genres and generations, becoming staples of pop culture.\n\n\"Always on My Mind\" is a poignant ballad that has been covered by countless artists, achieving international acclaim. Though originally written for Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson's 1982 rendition propelled the song to superstardom. James, along with co-writers Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher, secured Grammys for Country Song of the Year and Song of the Year in 1983.\n\nThe song's emotional depth resonated with audiences, making it a popular choice for weddings and other sentimental occasions. A later cover by the Pet Shop Boys further solidified its place in music history.\n\nElvis Presley's career received a significant boost with James' \"Suspicious Minds.\" Released in 1969, the song became Presley's last No. 1 single before his passing in 1977. James himself described the song as a \"sledgehammer,\" a testament to its powerful and enduring impact.\n\n\"Hooked on a Feeling\" might be James' most recognizable song. Originally penned for B.J. Thomas in 1969, the song has been covered by a vast array of artists, including Blue Swede and The Hives. Its infectious melody and sing-along chorus have secured its place in pop culture history. The song's ubiquity is further cemented by its inclusion in iconic films like Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" and Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\"\n\nJames' achievements extended far beyond individual songs.\n\nIn 2014, James received his rightful place in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, a prestigious honor recognizing his exceptional songwriting career. This recognition capped a long list of accolades, including inductions into the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nBMI, a leading music rights organization, recognized James' lasting contribution by naming him a Songwriter of the Century in 2000. This prestigious title underscores the enduring impact of his work.\n\nBorn Francis Zambon in Houston, Texas, in 1940, James' journey to musical stardom began with a love for cinema. Early exposure to movies instilled in him the power of storytelling, a skill that would later translate into his songwriting.\n\nJames initially pursued a career as a performer, but Houston club owners struggled to pronounce his birth name. Thus, Mark James was born, a stage name that would become synonymous with musical excellence.\n\nMark James leaves behind a rich musical legacy that will continue to inspire generations to come. His family, including his wife Karen Zambon, daughters Sammie and Dana Zambon, grandchildren, and extended family, will undoubtedly cherish his memory.\n\nJames' story is a testament to the power of dedication and talent.

The news was first reported by the Houston Chronicle.\n\n\"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations,\" his family said via statement.\n\nJames won both of his two Grammys in 1963 for \"Always on My Mind,\" which he co-wrote with Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher. The Willie Nelson hit took home trophies for country song of the year and song of the year. James and his co-writers initially wrote the tune for Elvis Presley, who released the track without much fanfare in 1972. Nelson's version a decade later popularized the song, and a cover by the Pet Shop Boys also achieved international success. \"Always on My Mind\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nJames was a frequent songwriter for Presley, writing \"Suspicious Minds\" for the beloved King of Rock and Roll. \"That song was a sledgehammer,\" he told the Houston Chronicle in 2014. In 1969, the track became Elvis' last No. 1 song before his death in 1977.\n\nJames may be most well-known for his song \"Hooked on A Feeling\" -- originally written for B.J. Thomas in 1969 and since covered by numerous artists, including Blue Swede and the Hives. The song, recognizable across generations, also appears in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nJames was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014, a decade and a half after BMI named him one of its Songwriters of the Century in 2000. He was also inducted into the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nJames was born Francis Zambon in Houston, Texas, in 1940. His father was an Italian contractor and his mother was a teacher. He frequented the movies as a child, where he learned that \"a great story can be told again and again.\" He began his career as a performer, changing his name early on because Houston club owners didn't like the sound of Francis Zambon.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Karen Zambon, his daughters Sammie and Dana Zambon, grandchildren and extended family.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_g_phillips@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Zoe G.

He became a staff songwriter for Chips Moman's production company in the late 1960s, and wrote songs that went on to be hits for B.J. Thomas and Elvis Presley. A selection of these included Thomas' \"The Eyes of a New York Woman,\" \"Hooked On A Feeling,\" and \"It's Only Love.\" James also wrote and recorded his own version of \"Suspicious Minds\" before Presley recorded his in 1969.\n\nAccording to James, in an interview with Wall Street Journal in 2012, per a report from Music News, \"In the years that followed, whenever I saw Elvis, he'd cross the room just to say hello to me - no matter who was with him. After he died, I heard he'd always asked the guys in the studio, 'Did Mark send me any more songs?' Golly, I wish I had known that.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, James' song \"Sunday Sunrise\" was recorded by Brenda Lee and subsequently covered by Anne Murray. Meanwhile, Presley continued to record James' songs, such as \"Raised On Rock,\" \"It's Only Love,\" and \"Moody Blue.\" James then co-wrote \"Always On My Mind\" with Johnny Christopher and Wayne Carson, which Presley released in 1972.\n\nWillie Nelson's cover of \"Always On My Mind\" became a huge hit, winning Mark James two GRAMMY Awards for Song of the Year and Best Country Song. Additionally, the song was also covered by Pet Shop Boys, becoming a smash hit in the U.K.\n\nMark James was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015, where his legacy lives on through the hit songs he penned over his career.\n\n(Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_boisvert@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Lauren Boisvert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B.

It was was first recorded by Brenda Lee, then Gwen McCrae before Presley recorded it as a B-side of \"Separate Ways.\"\n\nIn the U.K., the track was promoted to A-side status and became an instant hit, reaching number nine in the charts.

He was 83.\n\n\"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations,\" said the family said in a statement, per Variety.\n\nBorn Francis Zambon, the Houston native changed his name when he began performing guitar in public since the city's club owners thought he needed a name change. In his hometown, he launched his music career and cut his first single, \"Jive Note,\" in 1959. Eventually, he formed his own project, The Mark James Trio.\n\nAfter serving in Vietnam, he relocated to Memphis where he signed to a music publishing company and established his songwriting career with Houston native B.J. Thomas. He helped pen Thomas' breakout hit \"The Eyes of a New York Woman,\" \"It's Only Love,\" and later, the chart-topping \"Hooked On a Feeling,\" the Swedish group Blue Swede recorded in 1974.\n\nJames was also behind Elvis Presley's hit \"Suspicious Minds,\" which was originally released without much fanfare in 1968 but took off the next year when \"The King\" recorded it. Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter later turned it into a country hit in 1976, and The Fine Young Cannibals made the track a Brit-pop success in 1986. It would also be a soundtrack highlight for Dwight Yoakam in 1992.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn 1983, James won two Grammys for \"Always on My Mind,\" recorded by Willie Nelson and co-written by Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher. Before Nelson took it on, Presley had recorded a version of it in 1972, though it didn't take off at the time. However, a rendition by the Pet Shop Boys in 1987 helped it surge in popularity. In 2008, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nJames was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014. He was also inducted into the Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame, the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nIn his later years, the songwriter became more focused on film scoring. His songs have also been heard on soundtracks for films like Practical Magic, Reservoir Dogs, Honeymoon in Vegas, Kramer Vs. Kramer, Frequency and Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nThe prolific songwriter is survived by his wife of 53 years, Karen Zambon; his daughters Sammie and Dana Zambon; grandchildren and extended family.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willie Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_My_Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Always on My Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooked_on_a_Feeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hooked on a Feeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B.

The BBC reports that James died at his home in Nashville on June 8 at the age of 83.\n\nBorn Francis Rodney Zambon in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 29. 1940, James took up the violin in his youth before switching to guitar.\n\nHe launched his music career in Houston, playing the club scene before beginning to record his own songs. He released a string of minor local singles before interrupting his musical career to serve in Vietnam, and after he returned from the war, he relocated to Memphis at the urging of his childhood friend B.J. Thomas, signing a contract to write songs for producer Chips Moman, according to Music Row.\n\nMoman produced Thomas' recordings of \"The Eyes of a New York Woman,\" giving James his first hit in 1968. Thomas followed with two more James songs, \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and \"It's Only Love,\" in 1969.\n\nREAD MORE: Country Stars Who Have Died in 2024\n\nJames continued to record his own songs as he grew his songwriting career, including a recording of \"Suspicious Minds\" in 1968. Elvis Presley echoed his arrangement very closely for his 1969 cut on the song, which gave the iconic rock and country singer a No. 1 hit.\n\nJames would go on to score a long list of hits across genres over the '70s and '80s:\n\nJames studied film scoring at UCLA and the American Film Institute and began creating music for films later in his career. His songs have appeared in films including Reservoir Dogs and Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as on soundtracks for Kramer Vs. Kramer, Practical Magic and more.\n\nThe Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York inducted James in 2014, and he was also a member the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and Texas Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nBMI named James one of the top songwriters of the 20th century in 2000 alongside Elton John, Paul McCartney and more. The performing rights organization also recognized James' stellar career with multiple Million-Air Awards in 2022.\n\nMark James' cause of death has not been released publicly. In a statement to the Houston Chronicle, his family said \"his larger-than-life personality filled any room he was in, and his smile lit it up. He was a captivating storyteller who had the sweetest smile, the most infectious laugh and a twinkle in his eye that never dimmed.\"\n\nFuneral plans for Mark James are not publicly available.", "source": {"uri": "keanradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KEAN 105"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sterling_whitaker@keanradio.com", "name": "Sterling Whitaker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B.

He was 83.\n\nJames' death on Saturday, at his home in Nashville, Tenn., was first reported in the Houston Chronicle. In a statement, James' family said that \"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations.\"\n\nJames, born Francis Zambon in Houston, became an era-defining songwriter with 1968's \"Suspicious Minds,\" which he first released under his own name to little notice. But the song -- about a couple \"caught in a trap, I can't walk out... / We can't go on together with suspicious minds\" -- became an era-defining classic in the hands of Presley, who made it his final No. 1 single when he released it in 1969. The song made Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\n\nJames scored another generational classic with 1972's \"Always on My Mind,\" which he co-wrote with Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher. While the song was first recorded that year by Gwen McCrae, Brenda Lee and by Presley as well, Willie Nelson made it a country hit in 1982, reaching the top five of the Hot 100 and taking home Grammys for country song and song of the year. In 1987, the U.K. electro-pop duo Pet Shop Boys turned it into their their own hit single, reaching number four on the U.S. singles chart in 1987. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008 (as was \"Suspicious Minds\" in 1999).\n\nJames' song \"Hooked on a Feeling\" has had an equally long and varied life in pop culture. Originally written for B.J. Thomas in 1969 (who made it a top-five hit), Blue Swede ran it up to a No. 1 single in 1974 (re-purposing the \"ooga-chacka\" intro from a 1971 cover by Jonathan King). The song was more recently covered by garage rockers the Hives, and has made several cameos in films like Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs,\" Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and in the '90s TV series \"Ally McBeal.\"\n\nOther notable hits written by James included Brenda Lee's \"Sunday Sunrise,\" which hit the top 10 in 1973, and Blood Sweat & Tears' single \"Roller Coaster\" that same year. James was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nJames is survived by his wife Karen, daughters Sammie and Dana and his grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_My_Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Always on My Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willie Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Christopher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Christopher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trap music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_McCrae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gwen McCrae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Carson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Carson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone's_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brenda Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electropop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Swede", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue Swede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Songwriters Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooked_on_a_Feeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hooked on a Feeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pet Shop Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood,_Sweat_&_Tears", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood, Sweat & Tears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "B.

'I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.'\n\nWhile James' version failed to move up the charts, Presley went 'crazy' for the song when he first heard it and insisted on covering it.\n\nIn 1969, Suspicious Minds reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 -- the 18th and final Elvis song to do so.\n\nThey later worked together on other tracks like It's Only Love, Moody Blue and Raised on Rock.\n\nIn 2021, James said he was 'thankful' that his songs were 'still being embraced by new generations of listeners around the world.'\n\nIn a statement, his family added: 'Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations.'\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting

The Houston Chronicle reports that James passed away at his Nashville home on Saturday. No cause of death has been reported. James was 83.\n\nMark James was born Francis Zambon in Houston, where his father worked as a contractor and his mother as a teacher. He studied violin as a kid, then moved to guitar. In the late '50s, he formed a band, the Mark James Trio, and released a single called \"Jive Note.\" The band broke up when James was drafted to serve in Vietnam. When that was over, he moved to Memphis, where he worked as a staff writer for Memphis soul and country producer Chips Moman. James convinced his childhood friend B. J. Thomas to move to Memphis, and that's where Thomas started his career.\n\nIn 1968, Mark James wrote and released the original version of \"Suspicious Minds.\" James' single was a commercial failure, but its fortunes changed when Elvis Presley, chasing the high of his 1968 comeback special, went to Memphis to record with Chips Moman. Presley heard \"Suspicious Minds\" and decided to record his own version, and it became his last #1 hit.\n\nAnother Mark James song also became a big hit in 1969. A year earlier, he wrote \"Hooked On A Feeling,\" and Chips Moman produced B. J. Thomas' version of the song. Thomas' single reached #5. In 1973, the Swedish group Blue Swede recorded an extremely silly cover of \"Hooked On A Feeling,\" and that single became a #1 hit in the US.\n\nIn the early '70s, Mark James co-wrote the ballad \"Always On My Mind\" with Wayne Carson and Johnny Christopher. Brenda Lee and Elvis Presley both released versions of the song in 1972, but the song didn't really become a hit until the '80s, when two different versions made the top 10. Willie Nelson covered \"Always On My Mind\" in 1982, and his version reached #5. Five years later, the Pet Shop Boys released a version of \"Always On My Mind\" that became a worldwide hit and reached #4 in the US.\n\nMark James wrote a great many songs over the years, but those three standards make up a towering legacy on their own. James was inducted in the the Songwriters' Hall Of Fame in 2014. Check out the definitive versions of his three biggest songs below.", "source": {"uri": "stereogum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stereogum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B.

However, it wasn't until the late King of Rock and Roll took it to the top of the charts that it became a hit.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mark shared the poignant story behind the emotional lyrics of the song: \"Late one night, fooling around on my Fender guitar and using my Hammond organ pedals for a bass line, I came up with a catchy melody. I was married to my first wife then but still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston.\n\n\"My wife suspected I had those feelings, so it was a confusing time for me. I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\"\n\nElvis Presley's 18th and final chart-topper on the Billboard Hot 100 was marked by this iconic single. In a nod to its enduring legacy, the track was honoured with a Grammy Hall of Fame induction in 1999.\n\nSongwriter Mark reminisced about how the Hound Dog legend would always enquire about new songs from him. Sharing fond memories, he said: \"In the years that followed, whenever I saw Elvis, he'd cross the room just to say hello to me no matter who was with him. After he died, I heard he'd always asked the guys in the studio, 'Did Mark send me any more songs? ' Golly, I wish I had known that.\"\n\nOriginally named Francis Zambon, Mark opted for a name change after advice suggested his birth name wouldn't serve him well in the music industry. Among his other notable works, Mark wrote The Eyes Of A New York Woman and Hooked On A Feeling for BJ Thomas' album On My Way, with Thomas being remembered for the timeless hit Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_roberts@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_My_Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Always on My Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriters Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbert_Humperdinck_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hammond organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bassline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trap music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raindrops_Keep_Fallin'_on_My_Head", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooked_on_a_Feeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hooked on a Feeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hound_Dog_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hound Dog (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Way", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "My Way"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "B.

Mark James, who y the Houston Chronicle reported died at his home in Nashville on June 8 at age 83, left behind three: \"Suspicious Minds,\" the final No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 by Elvis Presley; \"Always on My Mind,\" which was a top five Hot 100 hit for both Willie Nelson and Pet Shop Boys; and \"Hooked on a Feeling,\" which was a top five Hot 100 hit for both B.J. Thomas and Blue Swede.\n\nJames won two Grammy Awards - song of the year and best country song - for \"Always on My Mind,\" an exquisite ballad he co-wrote with Johnny Christopher and the late Wayne Carson. The song was also named song of the year by the Country Music Association in both 1982 and 1983. (CMA rules at the time allowed songs to win twice in this category, an overly generous policy which we can forgive if it worked to the benefit of a song this timeless and classic.)\n\nJames was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014 and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame the following year.\n\nJames' other notable hits included \"The Eyes of a New York Woman,\" a top 30 Hot 100 hit for Thomas in 1968; \"Moody Blue,\" a top 40 Hot 100 hit for Presley in 1977 and the title track of his last studio album released in his lifetime; and \"Sunday Sunrise,\" a top 10 hit on Hot Country Songs in 1973 for Brenda Lee.\n\nJames was born Francis Rodney Zambon on Nov. 29, 1940, in Houston, Texas. He befriended Thomas, who grew up in nearby Rosenberg, Texas, while both were still young. (Thomas died in 2021 at age 78.)\n\nBy the late 1960s, James was signed as a staff songwriter to Memphis producer Chips Moman's publishing company. Moman produced Thomas' versions of James' songs \"The Eyes of a New York Woman\", \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and \"It's Only Love\" (which James co-wrote with Steve Tyrell). All three singles made the top 50 on the Hot 100 in 1968-69.\n\nJames released his own version of \"Suspicious Minds,\" also produced by Moman, on Scepter Records in 1968. Presley's 1969 version, co-produced by Moman and Felton Jarvis, topped the Hot 100 in the issue dated Nov. 1, 1969, becoming the final No. 1 for the King of Rock and Roll.\n\nIn 1972, Lee had the first notable recording of \"Always on My Mind.\" Her version reached No. 45 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. Presley recorded the song that same year, but, in what may have been a missed opportunity, allowed the song to go out as the B-side of a far less memorable song, \"Separate Ways.\" \"Separate Ways,\" Presley's follow-up to his No. 2 Hot 100 smash \"Burning Love,\" reached No. 20, but \"Always on My Mind\" may have had far greater potential. As noted, subsequent cover versions by Nelson and Pet Shop Boys both made the top five. (Pet Shop Boys' 1988 EDM version of this classic ballad served as a reminder that a great song can be interpreted any number of ways.)\n\nAlso in 1972, James signed a long-term contract with Screen Gems-Columbia Music. In 1973, Lee landed a top 10 hit on Hot Country Songs with James' \"Sunday Sunrise.\" Anne Murray revived the song with some success in 1975.\n\nIn 1974, James landed his second No. 1 on the Hot 100 when Blue Swede, a Swedish group, recorded \"Hooked on a Feeling.\" The song was propelled by a punchy performance and, especially, an \"ooga chaka\" introduction (borrowed from a 1971 cover by Jonathan King) that was at once grating and fiendishly clever. It was the love-it-or-hate-it hook that sent the song to No. 1 in April 1974.\n\nFine Young Cannibals, Jay-Z, Dwight Yoakam and Bill Withers are among the other artists who have recorded James' songs. James' songs have also been featured in such films as Kramer vs. Kramer, Black Hawk Down and Reservoir Dogs.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_grein@billboard.com", "name": "Paul Grein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_My_Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Always on My Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B.

I was married to my first wife then but still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston.\n\n\"My wife suspected I had those feelings, so it was a confusing time for me. I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\"\n\nIt marked Elvis' 18th and final no. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 1999, the 1969 recording by Elvis on RCA Victor Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nAccording to Mark, the 'Hound Dog' hitmaker was always asking after him to pen more tunes.\n\nHe recalled: \"In the years that followed, whenever I saw Elvis, he'd cross the room just to say hello to me - no matter who was with him. After he died, I heard he'd always asked the guys in the studio, 'Did Mark send me any more songs?' Golly, I wish I had known that.\"\n\nMark was born Francis Zambon - but changed his name after being told it wouldn't get him far in the music business.\n\nHe also penned 'The Eyes Of A New York Woman' and 'Hooked On A Feeling' for BJ Thomas' album 'On My Way', the late singer best known for the classic tune 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_My_Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Always on My Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriters Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hammond organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bassline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trap music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raindrops_Keep_Fallin'_on_My_Head", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooked_on_a_Feeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hooked on a Feeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hound_Dog_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hound Dog (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Way", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "My Way"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "B.

He was 83.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1982, Willie Nelson, Blue Swede and Elvis Presley achieved platinum-selling success via the trio of songs.\n\nJames' stardom as a songwriter was attached to his ability as a writer and multi-instrumentalist to compose songs that mirrored and fit into a robustly soulful, bluesy rock style borne of artists like Otis Redding and expounded upon by the likes of Englebert Humperdinck, Tom Jones and Ronnie Milsap, among the many that James eventually wrote for.\n\n\"I still think I could've been a successful performer,\" James said. \"I knew what a hit sounded like. The timing didn't work out -- timing always had to be just so to make it in that business. But I think I could've done it,\" James offered in a Houston Chronicle interview.\n\nHowever, his contributions via three multiple-time hit singles will span lifetimes.\n\n'Suspicious Minds'\n\nAmerican Sound Studios chief Chips Moman was recording Presley after the success of his NBC-broadcasted '68 Comeback Special that preceded his touring at Las Vegas' International Hotel a year later.\n\nAt the time, James had relocated from his native Houston to Memphis at Moman's behest to join his publishing and production company.\n\nBefore Moman \"discovered\" James, the creator born Francis Rodney Zambon had finally, after a half-decade. achieved regional success in New Orleans via the Ventural Records-released \"swamp pop\" single \"She's Gone Away.\" Impressed, Moman brought James to his company as an artist, songwriter, and producer. A year before working with Elvis, B.J. Thomas recorded three of James' songs: \"The Eyes of a New York Woman,\" the original take on \"Hooked On A Feeling\" and \"It's Only Love.\"\n\nHowever, when Presley arrived at American Sound, he walked past James' office and stopped when he heard something exciting.\n\nJames was playing a \"Suspicious Minds\" demo featuring Donna Jean Godchaux, Jeanie Greene, and the sisters Mary and Ginger Holliday on background vocals.\n\n\"It's like being in a place where your heart didn't belong,\" James has noted previously about the song. \"I was working off this title and that suspicion that happens when somebody you used to know comes by.\"\n\nIn 2012, he added to The Wall Street Journal, \"Late one night, fooling around on my Fender guitar and using my Hammond organ pedals for a bass line, I came up with a catchy melody. I was married to my first wife then but still had feelings for my childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston. My wife suspected I had those feelings, so it was a confusing time for me. I felt as though all three of us were all caught in this trap that we couldn't walk out of.\"\n\n\"I want that song and I want those girls,\" Godchaux recalled Presley noting via the Songfacts podcast.\n\n\"That song was a sledgehammer of a hit,\" James told the Houston Chronicle in 2014.\n\n'Always On My Mind'\n\nOutside of Presley's all-time best-selling single that topped charts in 27 countries, James' success was best typified by songs like \"Always On My Mind.\"\n\nThe song reached release by a half-dozen different artists (including Presley) in the decade between its first being cut by Brenda Lee in 1972 and eventually landing with Willie Nelson a decade later.\n\nWayne Carson (The Box Tops' 1967 #1 hit \"The Letter\") wrote \"Always On My Mind\" with James and Johnny Christopher, who were initially inspired by the former spending too long on a 1971 songwriting trip from Springfield, Missouri, to Memphis. Carson told his wife she was \"always on (his) mind\" to calm her.\n\n\"It just struck me like someone had hit me with a hammer,\" he told the L.A. Times. \"I told her real fast I had to hang up because I had to put that into a song.\"\n\nJohn Wesley Ryles achieved a minor country chart hit with the song in 1979. Still, three years later, Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson were brought the song by Johnny Christopher. At the same time, Christopher played the guitar during a 1981 recording session for what would become their duet album \"Pancho & Lefty.\"\n\nHaggard wasn't into the song. Instead, Nelson recorded it solo and eventually named it the title track of a Feb. 1982-released album.\n\nKeyed by the success of the platinum-selling CMA and Grammy-winning single, the album spent five years on the Billboard Top Country Albums charts. It peaked at number one for five months and spent two years on the all-genre Billboard 200, peaking at number two for three weeks.\n\n\"'Always On My Mind,' bowled me over the moment I heard it, which is one of the ways I pick songs to record,\" Nelson recalled in his 1988 autobiography, Willie. \"There are beautifully sad songs that bowl me over...haunting melodies you can't get out of your mind, with lines that really stick.\"\n\nIn 1988, the British pop band The Pet Shop Boys had an international dance hit with their rendition.\n\n'Hooked On A Feeling'\n\nLike \"Always On My Mind,\" the route the eventual 1974 global smash for Blue Swede took from James' pen to the world was circuitous.\n\nIn 1968, the cut was one of many James was writing for clientele, including Presley and B.J. Thomas. The latter cut the thumping soul groove and achieved worldwide top-10 success.\n\nSeeing performers like eventual Genesis, 10cc and Bay City Rollers producer Jonathan King performing the song in their sets inspired Blue Swede to borrow King's Texas rock-improvised \"ooga chaka\" vocal intro and play it as a smoother pop song.\n\nThat version hit No. 1 in America (the first #1 hit in the U.S. by a Swedish act) and top-10 worldwide. Intriguingly, The Blue Swede version reached the top the same week ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest with \"Waterloo\" and introduced themselves to an international audience. Blue Swede had more hits in Sweden but never again in the United States.\n\nIn later years, the song was featured on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's film \"Reservoir Dogs,\" on the legal comedy-drama series \"Ally McBeal,\" in the feature film \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" in \"Kramer Vs Kramer,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Breathless,\" \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" \"Practical Magic\" and \"Frequency.\"\n\nSince \"Guardians'\" 2014 release, the song has garnered nearly 500 million Spotify plays and led the film's soundtrack to become a platinum seller and mainstay on Billboard Soundtrack Charts for almost eight years.\n\n\"I'm thankful that my songs are still being embraced by new generations of listeners around the world. But in truth, I always knew these songs had magic, especially 'Hooked in a Feeling,'\" offered James to the Texas Heritage Songwriters Association in 2022.\n\nLegacy\n\nJames's ability to aid a song in being concise yet familiar and relatable inspired many, including B.J. Thomas and Jessi Colter, Mac Davis, Anne Murray and Waylon Jennings to achieve success with his work.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, James attended UCLA's film scoring program and studied at the American Film Institute. He began to work composing film soundtracks, including 2001's \"Trade Day.\"\n\nIn 2000, BMI named Mark James one of its top songwriters of the 20th century. John Lennon, Paul Simon, Norman Gimbel, Barry Mann, Paul McCartney, Roy Orbison and the teams of Holland-Dozier-Holland and Sir Elton John-Bernie Taupin were the only songwriters with three or more songs on the list.\n\nIn 2021, James signed a deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which, after his passing, will continue to manage the publishing for his timeless trio of hit singles.\n\nJames is a member of the Nashville, New York and Texas Songwriters halls of fame.\n\nJames' family, via a press statement, adds, \"Mark's legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations.\"\n\nJames, who died on June 8, is survived by his wife, Karen Zambon; his daughters, Sammie and Dana Zambon; grandchildren and extended family. Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens & Funeral Home (9090 Highway 100, Nashville, Tennessee 37221) will be handling arrangements, which have not been announced.", "source": {"uri": "commercialappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Commercial Appeal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chips_Moman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chips Moman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_James_(songwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark James (songwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_My_Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Always on My Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooked_on_a_Feeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hooked on a Feeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sound_Studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Sound Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Swede", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blue Swede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Christopher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Christopher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Deasy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Deasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Carson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Carson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swamp pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Milsap", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie Milsap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrecking_Crew_(music)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wrecking Crew (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbert_Humperdinck_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Jean_Godchaux", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Jean Godchaux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B.

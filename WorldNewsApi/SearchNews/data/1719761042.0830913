{"id": 225041434, "title": "Jeremy Renner left 'Mission Impossible' franchise to focus on being a dad", "text": "Jeremy Renner revealed that he chose his family over his career when he left the \"Mission Impossible\" franchise. His character, IMF agent William Brandt, was introduced in the spy franchise's fourth film, 2011's \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.\" He reprised his role in the fifth installment, 2015's \"Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.\" He did not return for the subsequent movies, and now he is explaining that he left the franchise for his daughter. \"I had to leave that,\" Renner told Collider in a new interview. \"It requires a lot of time away. It\u2019s all in London. I had to go be a dad. It just wasn't gonna work out then.\" JEREMY RENNER IS \u2018KIND OF EXCITED\u2019 FOR DEATH FOLLOWING SNOWPLOW INCIDENT Renner is father to daughter Ava, 11, whom he shares with his ex-wife Sonni Pacheco. The former couple was married from 2013 to 2014. The franchise made its debut in 1996 with \"Mission Impossible,\" and Tom Cruise has starred in and produced all six movies. Renner recalled that he had wanted to continue with the franchise, but his parenting responsibilities took precedence. \"I was supposed to do more with them,\" he said. \"I love those guys. I love Tom so much. We had so much fun, and I love that character a lot.\" The two-time Academy Award nominee also revealed that he could possibly return to \"Mission Impossible\" in the future. \"Maybe now that my daughter is older that could happen,\" he said. \"I'd always jump into a \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 anytime and back into Brandt. It\u2019s great.\" Since Renner's departure, 2018's \"Mission Impossible \u2013 Fallout\" and 2023's \"Mission Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckonining Part One\" have been released. The untitled eighth installment of the series is slated for a May 2025 release after it was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the SAG-AFTRA strike. Renner's dilemma over leaving the series was not the only instance in which he was torn between acting in a major film franchise and being present for Ava. In 2021, Renner told Men's Health magazine that he was willing to walk away from his role as Clint Barton/Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after his busy filming schedule made it very difficult to see his daughter. Renner recalled that he spent a year and a half flying from London to Los Angeles every weekend, though he often only had enough time to visit Ava for a few hours. \"The Hurt Locker\" star eventually came to the conclusion that he needed to give Marvel executives an ultimatum. \"It taught me how to have the nuts to say, \u2018Everyone, f--- off. It\u2019s my time with my daughter,'\" he said. LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

I\u2019m going to be here with my daughter.\u2019 It was pretty gnarly,'\" he told the outlet. Ultimately, the actor and Marvel were able to reach an agreement, and Renner retained his role as Hawkeye. Moving forward, Renner ensured that he would be able to visit Ava or have her come to see him every weekend while filming a project.

On New Year's Day in 2023, Renner was airlifted to a hospital after he was run over by his own Snowcat while attempting to tow a vehicle stuck in the snow near his home in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He suffered 30 broken bones, blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries. This January, Renner resumed filming his Paramount+ series \"Mayor of Kingstown\" after spending a year in recovery.

{"id": 223721510, "title": "Mike Tyson could 'sit down and quit' if he struggles in Jake Paul fight", "text": "Mike Tyson could 'sit down and quit' against Jake Paul, according to his old rival Evander Holyfield. The heavyweight legend fights YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul in July at the 80,000 seat Dallas Cowboys stadium in Texas. 'Iron Mike' will be 58-years-old on fight night, the same age Holyfield was when he was KO'd by former UFC champion Vitor Belfort three years ago. Tyson quit on his stool in his last professional fight against journeyman Kevin McBride almost two decades ago. When asked for his prediction on the fight, Holyfield told Fight Hub TV : \"It all depends on how Jake fights. The point of the matter is whether Jake Paul can take a good shot. I have never seen him get hit by anybody, but you never know, Mike might just quit in the ring and sit down and say I am done. \"I don\u2019t know how much confidence Jake Paul has but he will be a lot quicker. \"If he stays close to Mike, then his chance of winning is going to be great. If he tries to stay back from Mike, then he is going to get caught. Mike is like a snake. He will pop out on you, he gets there too quick. \"If you charge him, you can smother him because he pushes off his legs because he is too close. If you give him room, everybody will get knocked out going backwards. You are going to be messed up.\" Paul has put on a lot of weight to try and match Tyson's size in the ring, but the former heavyweight champion wasn't impressed with his bulked-up look when they faced off. \"Mike Tyson has called me fat but I believe fat will turn into muscle and come fight night I believe I will be able to move and dance around the ring like a true heavyweight,\" Paul told TMZ Sports. \"Everything has been good but it's been a little transition moving to heavyweight. I definitely needed to put on weight so that I'm able to compete with Mike Tyson.\" Their fight will be contested over eight, two-minute rounds and both men will wear 14-ounce gloves in the ring. Tyson hasn't fought since going eight rounds with fellow legend Roy Jones Jr in an un-scored exhibition fight four years ago whilst Paul KO'd unknown boxer Ryan Bourland in March.", "summary": "Tyson retired on his stool in his last professional fight almost two decades ago and Evander Holyfield thinks he could do the same against Paul in their fight this summer", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-32896501", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32838733.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jake-Paul-vs-Mike-Tyson-Boxing-Match-Arlington-Press-Conference.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:34:39", "author": "Harry Davies,Harry-davies", "authors": ["Harry Davies", "Harry-davies"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.093}

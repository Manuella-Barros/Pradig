Gadkari's direct appeal to Sitharaman\n\nNitin Gadkari, in a candid move, penned a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, advocating for the removal of the 18 per cent GST on life and medical insurance premiums. He argues that the current tax framework is unjust as it essentially taxes the inherent uncertainties of life. Gadkari asserts that this policy not only discourages individuals from securing insurance but also stifles the potential growth of the insurance industry.\n\n2. Burden on senior citizens\n\nGadkari highlighted the undue financial burden that the GST on insurance premiums places on senior citizens making it cumbersome for them to afford essential coverage. In his letter, he pointed out that the elderly, who are often on fixed incomes, face a disproportionate strain due to the high tax rate on products meant to provide them with security and peace of mind.\n\n3. Social necessity of medical insurance\n\nIn his correspondence, Gadkari said that the 18 per cent GST on medical insurance acts as a deterrent to the growth of this crucial sector. He termed medical insurance as a \"socially necessary\" service suggesting that taxing it heavily undermines its accessibility and affordability, potentially leaving many without vital health coverage.\n\n4. Nagpur Divisional Life Insurance Employees Union's memorandum\n\nThe letter came in response to a memorandum from the Nagpur Divisional Life Insurance Corporation Employees Union, which outlined the pressing challenges faced by the industry. This union, representing Gadkari's constituency, brought to light the adverse effects of GST on insurance premiums urging policy revisions to foster sectoral growth and consumer protection.\n\n5. Taxing life's uncertainties\n\nGadkari echoed the union's sentiment arguing that levying GST on life insurance premiums equates to taxing life's uncertainties. He suggested that individuals who proactively seek protection for their families should not be penalised with taxes on the premiums they pay, which serve as a safeguard against unforeseen life events.\n\n6. Differential treatment in savings and deductions\n\nThe minister also touched upon the differential treatment of savings facilitated through life insurance policies. He advocated for the reintroduction of income tax deductions for health insurance premiums, which could incentivise more individuals to opt for coverage. Such fiscal incentives, Gadkari implied, could bolster both individual financial planning and industry stability.\n\n7. Impact on the insurance sector's growth\n\nGadkari's letter pointed out the negative impact of the current GST regime on the insurance sector's growth trajectory. The minister argued that the high tax rate discourages potential customers from investing in insurance thereby restricting the sector's expansion and its capacity to provide comprehensive coverage options to a broader audience.\n\n8. A call for public sector insurance consolidation\n\nIn addition to tax concerns, the minister sought the need for the consolidation of public sector general insurance companies. Gadkari suggested that a more streamlined and unified approach could enhance efficiency, competitiveness and service delivery ultimately benefitting policyholders and the industry alike.\n\n9. Upcoming GST Council meeting\n\nThe GST Council, the authoritative body for determining GST policies, is scheduled to meet in August, following its last meeting on June 22. Gadkari's proposal will likely be a significant point of discussion as policymakers consider adjustments that could alleviate financial pressures on citizens and stimulate sectoral growth.\n\n10. Broader implications of Gadkari's proposal\n\nGadkari's call for GST withdrawal on insurance premiums reflects broader economic and social considerations. His advocacy highlighted the need for policies that balance fiscal responsibilities with the imperative of safeguarding citizen welfare. As the GST Council deliberates, the outcome could set a precedent for how essential services are taxed with potential ripple effects across the economy.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goods and Services Tax (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitin_Gadkari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nitin Gadkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tax policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nagpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Highway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Insurance_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life Insurance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/04/Untitled-design-33-2024-04-e723498f1e85c38f8b69b36d62c2373b.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778076", "eventUri": "eng-9778076", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 480, "textEnd": 487}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 3984, "textEnd": 3991}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The Union's main concern revolves around the 18% GST on both life and medical insurance premiums. \"Levying GST on life insurance premium amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life,\" Mr. Gadkari wrote, emphasizing the union's stance.\n\nImpact on Common People\n\nAccording to the Union, imposing a tax on premiums places an additional financial strain on people trying to protect their families from life's difficulties. They contend that people shouldn't have to pay taxes for attempting to keep their loved ones safe. Furthermore, it is believed that the 18% GST on medical insurance premiums will hinder the expansion of the insurance industry, which is vital to society.\n\nAdditional Points Raised\n\nThe union also raised other important issues, including the need to reintroduce IT deductions for health insurance premiums, the disparate treatment of savings through life insurance, and the merging of general insurance businesses in the public and private sectors. Mr. Gadkari has asked the Finance Minister to give these issues top priority, especially the elimination of the GST on insurance premiums, which has made things difficult for senior citizens.\n\nBudget 2024 Under Scrutiny\n\nThe letter from Mr. Gadkari is being received at a time when Budget 2024 is being criticised by a number of people. The government has been accused by the opposition of showing preference for states headed by TDP and JDU, two of its main supporters. There is a lot of discussion on social media about the high tax rates paid by salaried workers.\n\nResponse from the Finance Minister\n\nThe claims made by the Opposition have been refuted by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who claims that money has been distributed to every state. She made it clear that disregard is not implied when a state's name is omitted from the Budget Address.

In a letter dated July 28, which came to light today, Gadkari argues that levying GST on life insurance premiums is akin to levying tax on life's uncertainties and that this tax hinders the insurance sector's growth.\n\n\"You are requested to consider the suggestion of withdrawal of GST on life and medical insurance premium as a priority as it becomes cumbersome for senior citizens as per rules with due verification,\" read the letter sent by Gadkari to Sitharaman.\n\nCiting issues raised by the Nagpur Divisional Life Insurance Corporation Employees Union, Gadkari highlighted that an individual who purchases life insurance or medical insurance intends to protect herself and her family from the risk of uncertainties of life. Therefore, individuals should not be charged GST on premiums for coverage against such risks.\n\nIn the memorandum submitted by the employees' union to the Nagpur MP, the former also raised other concerns about the insurance industry including differential treatment of savings through life insurance, reintroducing income tax deductions for health insurance premiums and consolidation of public and sector general insurance companies.\n\nCurrently, an 18% GST is levied on premiums for all types of life and medical insurance policies. The Minister added that such a high GST rate on medical insurance premiums is turning out to be \"a deterrent to the growth of this segment of business which is socially necessary\". While in the past the insurance industry had pushed for a reduction in these tax rates, Nitin Gadkari has advocated for a complete removal of GST on life and medical insurance premiums.\n\nDeliberation on GST rates is taken up by the GST Council, a constitutional body responsible for GST implementation in India. The council includes the Union Finance Minister, Union Minister of State of Revenue and Ministers nominated by states.

The prosecution is saying what we've been talking about for the last couple of days has potentially happened, that the two Aussies and their American friend were ambushed.\"\n\nProsecutors allege Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"killed them, took their tyres, put the tyres on her car and drove back\".\n\nWhen he went back to their house, he allegedly told Ari Gisel, \"I f**ked up three gringos.\"\n\n\"She said to him, 'What do you mean by that?' And he told her, 'I killed them', and then showed her the vehicle with Jake, Callum and Jack's tyres on her car,\" Piotrowski said.\n\n\"Ari was arrested later that day, she had fled to her mother's house to get away from him. When the officers arrested her they said, 'You have the right to remain silent', and she said, 'I don't want to be silent, I want to tell you what I know. I'm a victim of domestic violence, I want to protect my four-year-old so let me help you with this case.' So she has spectacularly turned on him and will now be crucial in this case moving forward.\"\n\nPiotrowski added that the stunning revelation explained why Mexican officials \"have been able to put him behind bars so quickly and also how they found the bodies\".\n\n\"This conversation that he had with his girlfriend is pretty damning,\" she said.\n\nSo far only Jes\u00fas Gerardo Garcia Cota has been charged in connection with the deaths of the three men, and only with forced kidnapping.\n\nPiotrowski said the kidnapping charges may not be upgraded to murder until the next court hearing.\n\nAri Gisel Garc\u00eda Cota and Cristian Alejandro Garcia have only been charged with drug possession.\n\n\"The judge did say that he can't understand how one sole person could have done this, essentially kidnap and kill three men and take their tyres, it seems like too much,\" she said.\n\n\"He suggested that the prosecution needed to look into more suspects, that they needed to broaden their investigation because it couldn't have been done by one man alone.\"\n\nThe court hearing in Mexico came a day after the parents of Callum and Jake gave a heartbreaking statement from San Diego, California.\n\nMartin and Debra Robinson broke down in tears as they spoke of their sons, who vanished on April 27 sparking a frantic search after they failed to show up at the Airbnb they had booked in Rosarito.\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we share the news that Callum and Jake have been murdered,\" Ms Robinson said.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken and the world has become a darker place for us. We also mourn the loss of Carter Rhoad, a close friend. They were young men enjoying their passion of surfing together. Now it's time to bring them home to family and friends -- and the ocean waves in Australia. Please live bigger, shine brighter and love harder in their memory.\"\n\nShe said thanked those who had offered their condolences and said they had been \"overwhelmed with the outpouring of emotions and support\".\n\n\"We have always been very proud of their academic and sporting achievements and admired their life choices as,\" she said.\n\nShe spoke of Callum's \"larger than life character\" and his sporting achievement, playing professional lacrosse in America.\n\nShe described Jake as a \"happy, gentle and compassionate soul\" who was pursuing a career in medicine.\n\n\"Jake's passion was surfing and it was no coincidence that many of his hospitals that he worked in were close to a surfing beaches,\" she said.\n\nTheir comments came after the parents visited the morgue in Ensenada, Mexico, to identify their sons' bodies on Sunday.\n\nInstagram posts shared by Callum days before the trio vanished showed them relaxing at Rosarito Beach, where they had been surfing and camping.\n\nHis final post showed an image of San Miguel beach in Ensenada.\n\nAnother picture showed their white Chevrolet Colorado pick-up truck at a beach in Rosarito, which police believe was the same vehicle later discovered burnt out.\n\nJake, a Perth-based doctor, had flown to the US two weeks earlier to visit his brother, who was living in San Diego with his girlfriend Emily Horwath to follow his dream of becoming a professional lacrosse player.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms Horwath shared a voicemail from Callum on Instagram with the caption, \"Will be playing this on repeat.\"\n\nIn the message, Callum says, \"Happy Tuesday, good morning! It's 11.11 and I'm just thinking about you. Just wanted to drop you a quick message and say, hello baby, hope you're having a phenomenal start to your day. I'm sensing a big grin on your face for some reason today. I hope you're full of positivity and smiles. Cheers baby, miss you.\"\n\nIn an earlier post Ms Horwath said her heart was \"shattered into a million pieces\".\n\nMr Rhoad, a recruitment worker from San Diego, was due to marry his fiancee Natalie Wiertz in just a few months after he proposed in the middle of last year.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_chung@news.com.au",

the three of them and then shot them in the head.'\n\nThe police said they contacted US authorities to obtain the victims' cell phone numbers and were able to use this to track down Rhoad's phone which was in the possession of a woman, Ari Gisel Garc\u00eda Cota.\n\nCota and her partner Jes\u00fas Gerardo Garcia Cota, alias El Kekas, have since been charged.\n\nCristian Alejandro Garc\u00eda, the brother of Kekas, was also charged.\n\nThe area where the murders took place is currently under the control of the vicious Sinaloa cartel, headed by brothers Aquiles and Ren\u00e9 Arzate (pictured

of the missing men's phones as well as illegal drugs\n\nThe style of the executions have sparked fears locally about the possible involvement of drug cartels which are rife in the region (pictured: the trio's vehicle was later found burnt-out in the Santo Tom\u00e1s area)\n\nMexican authorities said bandits attacked the three to steal the tires off their truck before killing them all and dumping their bodies in a disused well\n\nAll three of the suspects were in possession of an assortment of methamphetamines and other illegal drugs at the time of their arrest, according to Zeta.\n\nThe three tourists were just a few days into their vacation when they disappeared on April 27.\n\nThe brothers' mother issued a desperate plea on social media after the group failed to turn up at an Airbnb they

suspected foul play as Jack Rhoad's burned-out truck was found as well as an abandoned campsite with traces of blood and 'dental parts'.\n\nThe recruitment worker from San Diego was due to marry his

Even if they were an objective witness, people make mistakes,\" Mallett said.\n\n\"It's very early days.\"\n\nHow long the forensic evidence will take to be processed will depend on the facilities available, Mallett said.\n\nThere being three sites to process -- the campsite, car and dump site -- may extend the investigation.\n\nThe condition of the sites, such as the car being burnt out, will also impact the investigation.\n\n\"That's why they torch vehicles, it's a good forensic countermeasure,\" Mallett said.\n\n\"All of that will take time to process.\"\n\nThe evidence is likely a top priority due to the high-profile nature of the case, and will most likely be fast-tracked, she said.\n\nIt will be complex due to the number of authorities contributing to the case as well, with it

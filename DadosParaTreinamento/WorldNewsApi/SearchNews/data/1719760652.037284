And one thing is missing from the list: Cyberpunk 2077, which for the first time since years before launch, has zero people working on it. Development has officially ended after some minor post-Phantom Liberty patches. You can see the graphic below, but the breakdown is as follows The Witcher 4 (it probably won\u2019t be called that) \u2013 407 employees Cyberpunk 2077 Sequel \u2013 56 Witcher Multiplayer Game \u2013 39 New IP \u2013 20 Cyberpunk 2077 CDPR CDPR has said that they want to now develop its larger games simultaneously rather than focusing only on one causing yawning gaps between releases. Though one has to wonder with the full weight of CDPR behind the Cyberpunk launch, releasing in the state it did, if that\u2019s viable. And these games, whether The Witcher or Cyberpunk, are massive in the grand scheme of the industry. Cyberpunk 2077 ceasing development is just a little bit funny given that it just won Best Ongoing Game at The Game Awards in 2023. There were debates about what constitutes an \u201congoing\u201d game, and I think it\u2019s just a bad category. There are \u201clive\u201d games, things like Fortnite or Genshin Impact that continually add seasons and content indefinitely. But there are also \u201cmost improved\u201d games that work hard to turn things around with big patches, content drops and expansions like Cyberpunk, even if they\u2019re not meant to live forever. Forbes VettedFor You The Best Gaming Mouse That\u2019ll Improve Your Aim By Jon Martindale Contributor I think Cyberpunk should have won some sort of award, but it was an awkward year. Phantom Liberty isn\u2019t really a full game, though it\u2019s the size of one, and it wasn\u2019t going for GOTY. Though Cyberpunk didn\u2019t really fit into the \u201congoing\u201d category either. But it won because anyone who had played Cyberpunk in its current state would agree it deserves to win something. As for The Witcher 4, we don\u2019t know much about it other than it\u2019s not really supposed to be The Witcher 4, a continuation of Geralt\u2019s story, but rather focusing on a new school and new characters (though I have to assume some old favorites will at least guest star). The Witcher 3 was out in 2015, so it\u2019s going to be over a decade until this sequel arrives, given how close to production start we still are. Whatever CDPR does next, hopefully they will be in 2023 Cyberpunk mode not 2020 Cyberpunk mode and produce the industry-best games we know they can make, in the right circumstances.

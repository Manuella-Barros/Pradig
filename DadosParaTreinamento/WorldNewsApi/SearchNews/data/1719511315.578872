Asked about a contention penalty awarded to Kilkenny, Rossiter insisted: \u201cI\u2019d need to look back on it. it was on the right side of the field because if it was the other side of the field, you wouldn\u2019t have seen any sign of a line with the amount of damage done with the concert last week. \u201cHow that can happen I don\u2019t know, to be honest, before a big championship match. \u201cI saw a picture of it during the week and I saw a picture at about 11 o\u2019clock this morning, I couldn\u2019t believe it. But it is what it is, we would have gladly played in Wexford Park, which is a good sod at the minute, but I don\u2019t think Kilkenny were going to change that. \u201cBut Bruce had to be played, I suppose. They had to dance in the dark up here for a couple of days but the pitch was the one to suffer.\u201d The penalty, dispatched by TJ Reid, seemed to be awarded by Liam Gordon for a foul on Eoin Cody that was committed outside the 21 metre line. Gordon issued no black card, the only offence for which a penalty can be awarded in that position. \u201cI suppose I was disappointed by the way it came about in relation to the position of where it was,\u201d Rossiter said, declining to complain. \u201cOnce the referee spreads out his two arms, there\u2019s no argument from me, there\u2019s not much I can do. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it later on to see where it actually was. \u201cWe were beaten at the end of the day so there is no point me having sour grapes about it.\u201d", "summary": "<p>KEITH Rossiter admitted he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe\u201d the condition of the Nowlan Park pitch after the recent Bruce Springsteen concert, with a section of the playing surface still bare.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/keith-rossiter-laments-bruce-springsteen-gig-they-had-to-dance-in-the-dark-up-here-for-a-couple-of-days-but-the-pitch-was-the-one-to-suffer/a422518698.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/5HCegBCZGmJ_IIY5TE3PjYv1DoI=/0x30:3147x2128/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/d44d4aa9-8b77-422b-8f4b-c42f641ad322/0bd553d5-b86f-4582-a0ae-673767ac518b/d44d4aa9-8b77-422b-8f4b-c42f641ad322.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:48:46", "author": "Conor Mckeon", "authors": ["Conor Mckeon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.298}

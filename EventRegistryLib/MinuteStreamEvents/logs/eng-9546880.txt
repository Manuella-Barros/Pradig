Toward the end of the game, Beverley threw a basketball at some of the Pacers fans twice, and he has now apologized for his actions.\n\n\"Unfortunate situation that should have never happened,\" Beverley said on The Pat Bev Podcast with Rone. \"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened, regardless of what was said, that should have never happened, simple as that.\"\n\nNBA insider Shams Charania had reported what led to Beverley throwing the ball at the fans, was a fan yelling, 'Cancun on three.' The 35-year-old made it clear it was more than just that.\n\n\"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three',\" Beverley continued. \"... I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one. Still inexcusable, it doesn't matter what was said. I have to be better and I will be better.\"\n\nBeverley claimed that he could have asked for some fans to be kicked out considering some of the things that were said to him. He stated that security even asked him if he wanted someone removed, but he said no, as he does not want people who paid to watch them play to get kicked out.\n\nBeverley added that while the winners get bragging rights, they can't just say whatever. Some fans he claimed made some very disrespectful remarks but did apologize, so it was all fine with them. A certain small group, though, crossed the line and in response, he did what he did. Beverley made it clear, though, that it won't happen again.\n\nThe damage has been done, however, and I struggle to see how Beverley does not get suspended by the NBA. That was a terrible look for the league and considering his history, they're not going to go very easy on him.\n\nPatrick Beverley Also Apologized To Malinda Adams\n\nThrowing the ball at fans twice was bad enough, but more was yet to come. During his postgame press conference, Beverley told ESPN producer Malinda Adams that she couldn't interview him as she hadn't subscribed to his podcast. That did not go down well with anyone, but Adams revealed Beverley did call her to apologize.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support,\" Adams wrote. \"I am humbled. Patrick Beverley just called me and apologized. I appreciate it and accept it. The Bucks also reached out to apologize. I've been in news for over 40 years and kindness and grace always win.\"\n\nI am glad Beverley at least had the decency to do that, instead of just putting out a statement or whatever. It was just a ridiculous act and he might be getting fined for that at some point.\n\nAs for this series against the Pacers, Beverley averaged 8.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.0 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game, as the Bucks lost in six games. This series might be the last time we see him in a Bucks uniform, as he is a free agent this summer.

I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened, regardless of what was said, simple as that.\"\n\nWith 2:32 left in the fourth quarter Thursday, Beverley threw a basketball into the stands, and the ball hit a fan in the head. Beverley asked for the ball back and then threw it with greater force back at another fan.\n\nBeverley sat down and exchanged words with another fan. Security intervened as Bucks players, including Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard, turned around to see what was happening.\n\nBeverley did not divulge exactly what was said, but referenced multiple \"crazy\" comments that \"crossed the line,\" and said he confronted at least two fans who apologized for their alleged comments.\n\n\"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three,' \" Beverley said, referencing a popular troll often used against teams whose seasons have ended. \"I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one. Still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said. ...\n\n\"I'm not going to take away from the fans that were great. It was some people that took it a little bit too far. I'm here to set the record straight that I was absolutely wrong. I need to be better and I will.\"\n\nBeverley said he declined to take action after a security guard apparently approached him to ask if he wanted to get a fan kicked out of the game for comments the fan allegedly made.\n\nBased on the video published Tuesday, however, it is unclear if Beverley will also address a different incident, a postgame interaction with an ESPN field producer, in which he asked her to leave an interview scrum because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. The field producer, identified later as Malinda Adams, posted on social media and said Beverley and the Bucks organization called her to apologize.\n\nBeverley, 35, just finished his 12th season in the NBA. Known as one of the fiercest defenders in the league, he averaged 6.2 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game in 73 appearances.\n\nContributing: Jeff Zillgitt\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Patrick Beverley: 'I was absolutely wrong' for throwing ball at fans", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_reyes@aol.com", "name": "Lorenzo Reyes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_OaBqJ_oEau4IH4jdbLAwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/c74e3b55dadaf00b735155b410920732", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

The league launched an investigation after Beverley threw a basketball twice at Pacers fans sitting behind Milwaukee's bench. After the game, Beverley also had an exchange with a media member that the league has deemed \"inappropriate.\"\n\nPer the league's statement:\n\n\"Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley has been suspended four games without pay for forcefully throwing a basketball multiple times at spectators and an inappropriate interaction with a reporter during media availability.\"\n\nThe Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department also launched an investigation into the situation involving the Pacers fans.\n\nWith a little more than two minutes left in the game, Beverley could be seen on camera throwing a basketball at a group of fans sitting behind Milwaukee's bench, striking a fan in the head. Beverley then asked for the ball back, after which he fired it with significantly more force back in the fans' direction.\n\nBeverley initially threw the ball after a fan allegedly shouted, \"Cancun ... Cancun on 3,\" as the Bucks were breaking their huddle after a timeout. Security stepped in, but Beverley and the fan continued to exchange words. Leading up to the Bucks guard throwing the ball twice, The Athletic reports that obscenities were shouted at Beverley, which led to the escalation of the situation.\n\nBeverley responded to the video on social media, saying it was \"not fair\" and that the Bucks \"asked for help all night\" about one of the fans behind the bench.\n\nDoc Rivers said he talked to Beverley about him throwing the ball, and while he understood that the fans were saying inappropriate things, that doesn't give him the right to do what he did.\n\n\"So we talked about that and then the ball-throwing incident,\" River said. \"And he made the comment to me about what was being said back his way and I just said, 'I get it, but we're coaches and athletes, we're the entertainers or whatever we are, sometimes they can be in the wrong, but you just can't do those certain things.' And he knows that as well.\"\n\nIn addition to that incident, following the loss, Beverley denied an ESPN producer, Malinda Adams, from joining in on his postgame media scrum because she did not subscribe to his podcast. After asking if she subscribes to his podcast, to which Adams replied she does not, Beverley said, \"You can't interview me then, no disrespect.\" When Adams remained next to him, Beverley moved her microphone while asking, \"Can you get that mic out of my face, please?\" After she remained close to record the interview, Beverley then said, \"Can you move that mic, please, or just get out the circle, please, for me? Please ma'am? You're not subscribed to my pod.\" After that, Adams then moved away.\n\nHere's how the interaction unfolded:\n\nAdams took to social media the following day to share that Beverley called her to apologize for the interaction. The Professional Basketball Writers Association also released a statement on the matter, condemning Beverley's behavior.\n\n\"The PBWA is extremely disappointed with the unprofessional conduct of Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley on Thursday night. Disrespecting and singling out a professional journalist who is merely trying to do her job is unacceptable.\n\nWe are proud of the many strong working relationships our members have with players, coaches and executives throughout the league. And while heated moments happen and are expected in our business, this type of behavior is atypical and should not be a part of any workplace.\n\nWe are please to hear that Beverley and the Bucks organization have apologized to ESPN's Malinda Adams. As Adams herself wrote on social media, \"Kindness and grace always win.\"\n\nRivers said he also talked to Beverley about this incident, and was glad that he called without having to be told by the Bucks organization to do so.\n\n\"I did [have a conversation with Beverley],\" Rivers said. \"I did right away because that's not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way. We're better than that. Pat feels awful about that. He also understands this is an emotional game and things happen. Unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him. So, I'm glad that he called, that didn't come from us. We talked about things you just can't do and so I'm glad that he called because that call came from him, not us telling him to make that call. That was good. I had not seen that interview. I just heard that that happened.\"\n\nBeverley finished with six points, five assists and two rebounds while going 3-for-11 from the field as the Bucks were eliminated from the playoffs. He was excellent in Milwaukee's Game 5 win on Tuesday, putting up 13 points, 12 assists and two steals. The series was chippy at times, with Bucks big man Bobby Portis being ejected from Game 4 after getting into a shoving match with Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard.\n\nLong known for toeing the line between passion and chaos, Beverley clearly crossed the line with his behavior and is now facing consequences for his actions. With the four-game suspension announced, it will be served next season as the Bucks are out of the postseason. However, with the 35-year-old veteran being an unrestricted free agent this summer, that suspension could be served somewhere other than Milwaukee.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_ward_henninger@cbssports.com", "name": "Colin Ward-Henninger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Portis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Portis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/08/f48370a4-0308-4338-bdfe-c9e9740dbbfc/thumbnail/1200x675/9b4694ac5792a4055a37241534b8e8e7/patrick-beverly-bucks-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.\n\nBeverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before, but added that his own actions were \"still inexcusable.\"\n\n\"I will be better,\" he said. \"I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened.

The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98, eliminating Milwaukee from the playoffs.\n\n\"I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more,\" Beverley said. \"That ... threw my whole vibe off.\"\n\nAfter the game, Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room.

Beverley could also serve a suspension with a new team as the 35-year-old veteran will be an unrestricted free agent this summer.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_ward_henninger@cbssports.com", "name": "Colin Ward-Henninger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Portis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Portis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/08/f48370a4-0308-4338-bdfe-c9e9740dbbfc/thumbnail/1200x675/9b4694ac5792a4055a37241534b8e8e7/patrick-beverly-bucks-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

Down 20, Beverley threw a basketball from the team's bench at a fan sitting behind him. He appeared to miss his target, a male Pacers fan, instead hitting a female Pacers fan in the side of the head before asking for the ball back.\n\nThe man collected the ball and tossed it back to Beverley, who immediately over-the-head, double-hand chucked it back at the fan. The fan deflected the ball as Bucks staff and security stepped in, but the fan and Beverley continued to exchange words.\n\nA case report was filed that night after an officer observed the interaction, and detectives are looking into the incident, a police spokesperson previously said. They are working with Gainbridge Fieldhouse to review video footage and plan to speak with those involved. The result of the investigation will be presented to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office, which will decide whether to bring charges.\n\nAccording to one source who witnessed the incident and two others who were briefed on it, the exchange between Beverley and one of the fans behind the bench escalated when the Bucks were breaking a huddle and the fan yelled, \"Cancun ... Cancun on 3.\"\n\nThose sources indicated that obscenities were said toward Beverley in the lead-up to the escalation.\n\nWhen asked about the exchange after the game, Beverley said: \"Nah, don't worry about that. Nothing.\"\n\nHe also addressed the exchange in a post on his X account, commenting on a video of the incident with the caption: \"Altercation between Pat Bev and Pacers fans behind the bench.\"\n\n\"Not Fair at all,\" Beverley wrote. \"Exchanged between a fan and our ball club all night. We warned and asked for help all night. Not fair.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Beverley wrote on X, \"But I have to be better. And I will.\"\n\nThe incident with fans preceded an exchange later on May 2 involving Beverley that drew widespread criticism. Beverley told ESPN producer Malinda Adams during a postgame media scrum that she couldn't ask him a question because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Adams said on social media on May 3 that Beverley called her and apologized for the exchange.\n\nBucks coach Doc Rivers said he had a conversation with Beverley about his actions.\n\n\"I did (speak with Beverley) right away because that's not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way,\" Rivers said. \"We're better than that. Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\n\nRivers said he discussed the ball-throwing incident with Beverley.\n\n\"He made the comment to me about what was being said back his way and I just said, 'I get it, but we're coaches and athletes, we're the entertainers or whatever we are. Sometimes (fans) can be in the wrong, but you just can't do those certain things.' And he knows that as well,\" Rivers said.\n\nBeverley scored six points in Game 6, adding five assists and two rebounds. He averaged 8.6 points in the playoffs, peaking at 13 points.\n\nThe guard joined the Bucks in February via a trade that sent the Philadelphia 76ers a second-round pick and Cameron Payne. Beverley averaged 6.0 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game through 26 contests with Milwaukee in the regular season.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Payne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Payne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/03164138/GettyImages-2151002109-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 2273, "textEnd": 2278}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 2514, "textEnd": 2519}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

Beverley then waved at a different fan to throw the ball back to him, which he did, and then Beverley chucked the ball right back at him hard.\n\nBeverley kept jawing with fans behind their bench before teammates and others defused the situation. He was not ejected from the game, but he didn't return. The Bucks were down by 20 points at the time.\n\nBeverley later responded on social media and said that fans were going at them all night.

And Beverley did little to quiet his critics near the end of and after a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers in Game 6 last week.\n\nBeverley, who recorded 6 points, 2 rebounds, and 5 assists on 3-11 shooting in the Bucks' 120-98 loss, found himself at the center of two separate controversies that night. The first came near the end of the game, when Beverley threw a basketball twice at a group of fans behind the Bucks' bench. The first time Beverley threw the ball, it hit an unsuspecting woman in the side of the head, and after the ball was returned to Beverley, he threw it again at a Pacers fan who was seated near the woman Beverley hit initially.\n\nOn the latest episode of the \"Pat Bev Pod,\" which is set to release tomorrow, Beverley said he should not have done it. But he also claimed the fan said more than \"Canc\u00fan on 3,\" which NBA insider Shams Charania reported the fan said before the incident escalated.\n\n\"Unfortunate situation that should have never happened,\" Beverley said. \"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened, simple as that.\n\n\"Let's just say it was more than \"Canc\u00fan on 3. ... I've been called a lot of stuff in this league, but I haven't been called that one. Still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said. ... I'm not going to take away from the fans that were great. It was some people that took it a little bit too far.\"\n\nBeverley, while not indicating exactly what was allegedly said by the fan, claimed he could have had multiple fans kicked out of the game.\n\n\"I'm not the guy to get fans kicked out neither. The things that were said to me, I could have got four or five fans kicked out. Literally, security walked up to me, 'You wanna get that fan thrown out?'. 'Nah, man.' You can say anything when you're winning, that what happens when you win. You can literally say anything.\n\n\"We in layup line, I'm on the bench with the ball, fan to the right of me say something crazy. I get up to him, 'Hey, man. You can boo me, but don't call me that.' ... Everyone who stepped out of line and said something like too crazy, all of them apologized. It was just some people who just crossed the line a little bit.\"\n\nBy framing his non-apology the way he did and by not revealing what the fan allegedly said to him, Beverley opens himself to another round of criticism. Of course, if the fan said something derogatory to Beverley, they should have been kicked out. But Beverley cannot say with a straight face that he will be better while in the same breath giving excuses for the behavior he claims he will never do again.\n\nIf he truly does not believe he should apologize, then don't. Most people have already made their minds up about who or what Beverley is, so deciding against apologizing will make little difference in how he is perceived. And it is actually more respectable for a person to not apologize because they truly don't think they did anything wrong than an insincere, excuse-filled apology.\n\nFor his part in the incident, Beverley should and will likely be hit with a multiple-game suspension by the NBA to start next season. The league said it was investigating the matter, and regardless of what was said by the fan, Beverley will likely be used as an example by the NBA to players that throwing objects at fans will be punished. The NBA has been extra careful with player-fan interactions since the infamous Malice at the Palace brawl in 2004.\n\nEven if he does not earn a suspension, he will certainly be fined. The league already issues fines or technical fouls for throwing the ball in the stands; Victor Wembanyama was fined $25,000 for a post-game celebration in March that saw him heave the ball into the home crowd after a victory. Several years ago, Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic was also hit with a technical for kicking the ball, which went into the stands.\n\nThe NBA will likely also not look too fondly on Beverley, who found himself in another controversy after the Bucks' Game 6 loss when he denied longtime ESPN producer Malinda Adams from asking him a question during a media scrum because she wasn't subscribed to his podcast.

After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.\n\nBeverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" that was released Wednesday.

He said it was because she didn\u00b4t subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.\n\nThe next day, Adams said on X that she had received apologies from both the Bucks and from Beverley himself.\n\nOn his podcast, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that \"it was never my intent to disrespect you.\"\n\nA day after the game, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley\u00b4s behavior was \"not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.\"\n\n\"We\u00b4re better than that,\" Rivers said. \"Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally - this is an emotional game and things happen - unfortunately, you\u00b4re judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"\n\nThe Bucks acquired the 35-year-old Beverley from the Philadelphia 76ers at the trade deadline.

He also understands emotionally - this is an emotional game, and things happen - unfortunately, you're judged immediately, and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"\n\nIn 40 minutes of action in Game 6, Beverley finished with 6 points, 2 rebounds, and 5 assists. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmine_payo@rappler.com", "name": "Jasmine Payo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jae_Crowder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jae Crowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/05/REUTERS-PATRICK-BEVERLEY-MAY-9-2024-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 295, "textEnd": 300}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

This is what happened at the conclusion of Game 6 against the Indiana Pacers, a game that the Bucks lost 120-92 and were subsequently eliminated from the playoffs. After head coach Doc Rivers emptied his bench, pulling Beverley and others from the game, the veteran acted completely out of line and ended up being involved in an incident with a Pacers' fan.\n\nFor some odd reason, Beverley carried a basketball with him to the bench at the end of the game. From there, he got into a heated exchange with some fans behind the Bucks' bench, and Beverley promptly threw the ball into the stands, hit a woman in the head with the basketball. Upon asking for the ball back, Beverley again threw the ball at a man who was sitting a row ahead of the first fan he struck. It was later revealed by The Athletic's Shams Charania that the fan yelled, \"Cancun on 3\" at Beverley and the Bucks.\n\nThe NBA and commissioner Adam Silver have since said that they are reviewing the incident and looking into Beverley's interaction with the fan.\n\nBeverley took to his podcast recently to address the matter, breaking his silence on what actually transpired at the conclusion of Game 6 in Indianapolis.\n\n\"Unfortunate situation that should have never happened.

That means Beverley will serve his suspension without pay next season and will be ineligible for the first four games of the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe incident happened as the Bucks trailed 114-94 with 2:32 remaining in Game 6. Beverley had just checked out of the game, when he threw a basketball into the stands behind the bench. The ball hit a Pacers fan in the face. Beverley asked the fans for the ball back and then chucked it again into the crowd with greater force. He finished the night with six points, five assists and two rebounds, and wasn't penalized for the throws during the game, but the league handed down a swift suspension on Thursday.\n\nPATRICK BEVERLEY throws ball at Pacers fans, later removes reporter from interview\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBeverley accepted responsibility for the incident on \"The Pat Bev Podcast.\"\n\n\"Unfortunate situation that should've never happened,\" Beverley said on May 7. \"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened, regardless of what was said, simple as that.\"\n\nIt's not clear what led to the altercation. The Athletic reported that a fan shouted \"Cancun on 3\" before Beverley tossed the ball their direction. Beverley, who was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the Bucks in February, later claimed on X that the Bucks \"warned and asked for help all night\" following exchanges \"between a fan and our ball club all night.\" Beverley added, \"Not fair at all.\"\n\nBeverley didn't share what was said exactly on his podcast, but he did say \"crazy\" comments that \"crossed the line\" were shouted his way: \"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three.' I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one. Still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said.\"\n\nPATRICK BEVERLEY: 'I was absolutely wrong' for throwing basketball at Pacers fans\n\n\"Inside the NBA\" analyst Charles Barkley said Beverley crossed the line with his \"stupid\" act and is deserving of a lengthy suspension.\n\n\"He hit that lady in the head,\" Barkley said during TNT's broadcast. \"Listen, I've done stupid stuff and I got criticized. That's just wrong. He's gonna get suspended for that. And that's gonna be a good one, too. 'Cause he didn't do it once. He did it twice.\"\n\nBeverley is no stranger to discipline from the league, which factors prior unsportsmanlike conduct into future punishments. Here's a look at Beverley's past incidents:\n\nMay 2024: Beverley apologizes for shunning ESPN reporter\n\nBeverley's antics did not end on the court. During his post-game media scrum in the Bucks' locker room, according to a video clip posted on social media, Beverley interrupted one question and turned to someone holding an ESPN microphone.\n\nFollowing the ball throwing incident on Thursday, Beverley also had an exchange with longtime ESPN producer Malinda Adams in the locker room. Social media videos show Beverley interrupt the postgame interview to ask Adams if she subscribes to his podcast, \"The Pat Bev Show,\" which airs on the Barstool Sports network. After Adams said no, Beverley shunned her, asked her to leave and went as far as swatting her microphone away: \"You can't interview me then. No disrespect.\"\n\nJanuary 2023: Technical foul for camera-referee antics\n\nBefore the start of the Lakers' 125-121 overtime loss to the Boston Celtics on Jan. 28, 2023, where referees failed to call a foul on Jayson Tatum when it was clear he hit LeBron James' arm on a potential game-winning shot, Beverley grabbed a camera, walked to referee Eric Lewis and tried to show him James was fouled.\n\nLewis did not care for Beverley's attempt to provide evidence of the foul and gave him a technical foul. As Beverley walked back to the Lakers bench, he held the camera in the air while pointing at it and looking back at Lewis.\n\nMORE: Patrick Beverley gets technical for showing ref camera after LeBron James doesn't get call\n\nNovember 2022: Three game suspension for shoving Deandre Ayton\n\nWith Phoenix leading 106-96 late in their 115-105 win over the Lakers on Nov. 22, 2022, Suns' Devin Booker was called for a Flagrant One foul on Lakers' Austin Reaves after Booker hit Reaves in the face on a block attempt. Reaves was on the ground with Booker and Deandre Ayton standing over him, when Beverley ran over and pushed Ayton from behind. Beverley, who played on the Lakers from 2022-2023, was suspended for three games.\n\n\"Very unprofessional by myself. Definitely could have reacted in a different way,\" Beverley later said. \"So, yeah, I'm a big boy. I'll take my lumps however they come.\"\n\nJuly 2021: One game suspension for shoving Chris Paul\n\nThe Suns moved on to the 2021 NBA Finals after defeating the Los Angeles Clippers 130-103 in the Conference Finals on June 30, 2021. Beverley, who played on the Clippers from 2017-2021, shoved Suns star Chris Paul from behind with 5:49 remaining in the fourth quarter. Beverley was suspended one game for the shove, which the league said Beverley would serve the first game of the 2021-22 NBA regular season.\n\nThe next day, Beverley tweeted in apology: \"@CP3 emotions got the best of me last night gang. My bad wasn't meant for you. Congrats on making it to the Finals. Best of Luck.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bucks' Patrick Beverley suspended for throwing ball at Pacers fans", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed an investigation into the incident is underway.\n\n'The report has been forwarded to IMPD detectives, who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously,' IMPD said in a statement.

After a nearby fan lobbed the ball back to the 14-year veteran, Beverley threw an strong chest pass into the stands.\n\nAs Beverley appears to have jawed with someone in the crowd after his aggressive toss, the escalation led security to intervene.\n\nDuring the Bucks post-game locker room availability, Beverley bizarrely asked ESSPN reporter Malinda Adams out of nowhere if she subscribed to his podcast.

That means Beverley will serve his suspension without pay next season and will be ineligible for the first four games of the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe incident happened as the Bucks trailed 114-94 with 2:32 remaining in Game 6. Beverley had just checked out of the game, when he threw a basketball into the stands behind the bench. The ball hit a Pacers fan in the face. Beverley asked the fans for the ball back and then chucked it again into the crowd with greater force. He finished the night with six points, five assists and two rebounds, and wasn't penalized for the throws during the game, but the league handed down a swift suspension on Thursday.\n\nPATRICK BEVERLEY throws ball at Pacers fans, later removes reporter from interview\n\nBeverley accepted responsibility for the incident on \"The Pat Bev Podcast.\"\n\n\"Unfortunate situation that should've never happened,\" Beverley said on May 7. \"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened, regardless of what was said, simple as that.\"\n\nIt's not clear what led to the altercation. The Athletic reported that a fan shouted \"Cancun on 3\" before Beverley tossed the ball their direction. Beverley, who was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the Bucks in February, later claimed on X that the Bucks \"warned and asked for help all night\" following exchanges \"between a fan and our ball club all night.\" Beverley added, \"Not fair at all.\"\n\nBeverley didn't share what was said exactly on his podcast, but he did say \"crazy\" comments that \"crossed the line\" were shouted his way: \"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three.' I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one. Still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said.\"\n\nPATRICK BEVERLEY: 'I was absolutely wrong' for throwing basketball at Pacers fans\n\n\"Inside the NBA\" analyst Charles Barkley said Beverley crossed the line with his \"stupid\" act and is deserving of a lengthy suspension.\n\n\"He hit that lady in the head,\" Barkley said during TNT's broadcast. \"Listen, I've done stupid stuff and I got criticized. That's just wrong. He's gonna get suspended for that. And that's gonna be a good one, too. 'Cause he didn't do it once. He did it twice.\"\n\nBeverley is no stranger to discipline from the league, which factors prior unsportsmanlike conduct into future punishments. Here's a look at Beverley's past incidents:\n\nBeverley's antics did not end on the court. During his post-game media scrum in the Bucks' locker room, according to a video clip posted on social media, Beverley interrupted one question and turned to someone holding an ESPN microphone.\n\nFollowing the ball throwing incident on Thursday, Beverley also had an exchange with longtime ESPN producer Malinda Adams in the locker room. Social media videos show Beverley interrupt the postgame interview to ask Adams if she subscribes to his podcast, \"The Pat Bev Show,\" which airs on the Barstool Sports network. After Adams said no, Beverley shunned her, asked her to leave and went as far as swatting her microphone away: \"You can't interview me then. No disrespect.\"\n\nBefore the start of the Lakers' 125-121 overtime loss to the Boston Celtics on Jan. 28, 2023, where referees failed to call a foul on Jayson Tatum when it was clear he hit LeBron James' arm on a potential game-winning shot, Beverley grabbed a camera, walked to referee Eric Lewis and tried to show him James was fouled.\n\nLewis did not care for Beverley's attempt to provide evidence of the foul and gave him a technical foul. As Beverley walked back to the Lakers bench, he held the camera in the air while pointing at it and looking back at Lewis.\n\nMORE: Patrick Beverley gets technical for showing ref camera after LeBron James doesn't get call\n\nWith Phoenix leading 106-96 late in their 115-105 win over the Lakers on Nov. 22, 2022, Suns' Devin Booker was called for a Flagrant One foul on Lakers' Austin Reaves after Booker hit Reaves in the face on a block attempt. Reaves was on the ground with Booker and Deandre Ayton standing over him, when Beverley ran over and pushed Ayton from behind. Beverley, who played on the Lakers from 2022-2023, was suspended for three games.\n\n\"Very unprofessional by myself. Definitely could have reacted in a different way,\" Beverley later said. \"So, yeah, I'm a big boy. I'll take my lumps however they come.\"\n\nThe Suns moved on to the 2021 NBA Finals after defeating the Los Angeles Clippers 130-103 in the Conference Finals on June 30, 2021. Beverley, who played on the Clippers from 2017-2021, shoved Suns star Chris Paul from behind with 5:49 remaining in the fourth quarter. Beverley was suspended one game for the shove, which the league said Beverley would serve the first game of the 2021-22 NBA regular season.\n\nThe next day, Beverley tweeted in apology: \"@CP3 emotions got the best of me last night gang. My bad wasn't meant for you. Congrats on making it to the Finals.

That means Beverley will serve his suspension without pay next season and will be ineligible for the first four games of the 2024-25 season.\n\nThe incident happened as the Bucks trailed 114-94 with 2:32 remaining in Game 6. Beverley had just checked out of the game, when he threw a basketball into the stands behind the bench. The ball hit a Pacers fan in the face. Beverley asked the fans for the ball back and then chucked it again into the crowd with greater force. He finished the night with six points, five assists and two rebounds, and wasn't penalized for the throws during the game, but the league handed down a swift suspension on Thursday.\n\nPATRICK BEVERLEY throws ball at Pacers fans, later removes reporter from interview\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBeverley accepted responsibility for the incident on \"The Pat Bev Podcast.\"\n\n\"Unfortunate situation that should've never happened,\" Beverley said on May 7. \"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened, regardless of what was said, simple as that.\"\n\nIt's not clear what led to the altercation. The Athletic reported that a fan shouted \"Cancun on 3\" before Beverley tossed the ball their direction. Beverley, who was traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the Bucks in February, later claimed on X that the Bucks \"warned and asked for help all night\" following exchanges \"between a fan and our ball club all night.\" Beverley added, \"Not fair at all.\"\n\nBeverley didn't share what was said exactly on his podcast, but he did say \"crazy\" comments that \"crossed the line\" were shouted his way: \"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three.' I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one. Still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said.\"\n\nPATRICK BEVERLEY: 'I was absolutely wrong' for throwing basketball at Pacers fans\n\n\"Inside the NBA\" analyst Charles Barkley said Beverley crossed the line with his \"stupid\" act and is deserving of a lengthy suspension.\n\n\"He hit that lady in the head,\" Barkley said during TNT's broadcast. \"Listen, I've done stupid stuff and I got criticized. That's just wrong. He's gonna get suspended for that. And that's gonna be a good one, too. 'Cause he didn't do it once. He did it twice.\"\n\nBeverley is no stranger to discipline from the league, which factors prior unsportsmanlike conduct into future punishments. Here's a look at Beverley's past incidents:\n\nMay 2024: Beverley apologizes for shunning ESPN reporter\n\nBeverley's antics did not end on the court. During his post-game media scrum in the Bucks' locker room, according to a video clip posted on social media, Beverley interrupted one question and turned to someone holding an ESPN microphone.\n\nFollowing the ball throwing incident on Thursday, Beverley also had an exchange with longtime ESPN producer Malinda Adams in the locker room. Social media videos show Beverley interrupt the postgame interview to ask Adams if she subscribes to his podcast, \"The Pat Bev Show,\" which airs on the Barstool Sports network. After Adams said no, Beverley shunned her, asked her to leave and went as far as swatting her microphone away: \"You can't interview me then. No disrespect.\"\n\nJanuary 2023: Technical foul for camera-referee antics\n\nBefore the start of the Lakers' 125-121 overtime loss to the Boston Celtics on Jan. 28, 2023, where referees failed to call a foul on Jayson Tatum when it was clear he hit LeBron James' arm on a potential game-winning shot, Beverley grabbed a camera, walked to referee Eric Lewis and tried to show him James was fouled.\n\nLewis did not care for Beverley's attempt to provide evidence of the foul and gave him a technical foul. As Beverley walked back to the Lakers bench, he held the camera in the air while pointing at it and looking back at Lewis.\n\nMORE: Patrick Beverley gets technical for showing ref camera after LeBron James doesn't get call\n\nNovember 2022: Three game suspension for shoving Deandre Ayton\n\nWith Phoenix leading 106-96 late in their 115-105 win over the Lakers on Nov. 22, 2022, Suns' Devin Booker was called for a Flagrant One foul on Lakers' Austin Reaves after Booker hit Reaves in the face on a block attempt. Reaves was on the ground with Booker and Deandre Ayton standing over him, when Beverley ran over and pushed Ayton from behind. Beverley, who played on the Lakers from 2022-2023, was suspended for three games.\n\n\"Very unprofessional by myself. Definitely could have reacted in a different way,\" Beverley later said. \"So, yeah, I'm a big boy. I'll take my lumps however they come.\"\n\nJuly 2021: One game suspension for shoving Chris Paul\n\nThe Suns moved on to the 2021 NBA Finals after defeating the Los Angeles Clippers 130-103 in the Conference Finals on June 30, 2021. Beverley, who played on the Clippers from 2017-2021, shoved Suns star Chris Paul from behind with 5:49 remaining in the fourth quarter. Beverley was suspended one game for the shove, which the league said Beverley would serve the first game of the 2021-22 NBA regular season.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

Bucks guard shares details from ball throwing incident", "body": "Patrick Beverley found himself in hot water last week.\n\nThe Bucks guard earned countless NBA fans' rancor after chucking a ball into the stands multiple times during Milwaukee's Game 6 loss to the Pacers on Thursday night.\n\nIt was a polarizing decision, to say the least. Beverley struck at least one fan in the head with his strike, prompting security to step in. It was rumored that fans behind the Bucks' bench had yelled out obscenities toward Beverley and his teammates, further inflaming the situation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beverley had his say on the matter. In clips released from his eponymous podcast, he talked about the circumstances that led him to fire the basketball toward the concourses last week.\n\nMORE: Tyrese Haliburton trolls Patrick Beverley with Damian Lillard tweet\n\nAccording to Beverley, the Pacers fans who Beverley threw the ball toward said things that \"crossed the line.\"\n\n\"Let's just say it was more than just 'Cancun on 3,'\" Beverley said.\n\nThe Athletic's Shams Charania reported that the immediate spark to Beverley's feud with the Pacers fan he threw the ball toward was the \"Canc\u00fan...Canc\u00fan on 3\" comment.\n\nBeverley indicated that a few Indiana fans took things too far during Thursday night's contest. However, he was able to make amends with most of them, telling spectators to refrain from being disrespectful toward him. That wasn't quite the case with the group of fans he struck with his throw.\n\nNevertheless, Beverley apologized for the incident, telling his co-host that he never should have put himself in that position in the first place.\n\n\"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened,\" Beverley said. \"I have to be better and I will be better. ... Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened.\"\n\nThis post will be updated if Beverley says more on the matter when the full podcast is released.\n\nAt present, the NBA is investigating Beverley's actions at the end of Thursday's game, as well as his interaction with ESPN producer Malinda Adams in the locker room after the Bucks' season-ending loss.\n\nIt's unclear quite whether Beverley will be suspended. On one hand, he didn't receive a penalty during the game. However, the league has tended to take a hardline stance about interactions between players and fans in the aftermath of the Malice in the Palace back in 2003.\n\nFor example, in 2019, then-Wizards guard Isaiah Thomas was suspended two games without pay for walking into the stands to calmly address two 76ers fans who made obscene gestures and fired obscenities toward Thomas.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-02/Patrick%20Beverley%20020924.jpg?itok=vg5Y_XPC", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

After he asked for the ball back, and had it thrown back to him, he then fired it back at that fan.\n\nPolice said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives \"who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously,\" and that the case will be presented to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office after the investigation is completed.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" released Wednesday, Beverley said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were \"still inexcusable.\"\n\n\"I will be better,\" he said. \"I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.\"\n\nBeverley, who was on a minimum contract this season with the Philadelphia 76ers and then the Bucks, will be an unrestricted free agent this summer. He would lose roughly $90,000 as a result of the suspension if he signs a minimum contract again next season, which is projected to be $3.3 million, per ESPN's Bobby Marks.\n\nAfter the game, Beverley wouldn't allow Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.\n\nOn his podcast Wednesday, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that \"it was never my intent to disrespect you.\"\n\nTim Frank, the NBA's senior vice president of league operations communications, said in a statement that, \"Patrick Beverley's behavior towards ESPN producer Malinda Adams was unacceptable, unprofessional and failed to meet the standard that NBA players consistently meet in their interactions with the media.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Beverley, who just completed his 12th season in the NBA, has been suspended at the conclusion of a campaign. In 2021, he was hit with a one-game suspension while playing for the LA Clippers after shoving Chris Paul in the back as both players were walking to their respective benches late in the fourth quarter of a blowout loss to the Phoenix Suns in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals.\n\nHe served that suspension in the opener of the 2021-22 season as a result.\n\nBeverley, who will turn 36 in July, averaged 8.2 points and 5.5 assists across the six games against Indiana in the playoffs, starting all of them.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0503%2Fr1327968_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The league is also looking into Beverley's interaction with a media member while inside the locker room following the loss.\n\nWith a little more than two minutes left in the game Thursday night, Beverley could be seen on camera throwing a basketball at a group of fans sitting behind Milwaukee's bench, striking a fan in the head. Beverley then asked for the ball back, after which he fired it with significantly more force back in the fans' direction.\n\nBeverley throwing the ball happened after a fan allegedly shouted, \"Cancun ... Cancun on 3,\" as the Bucks were breaking their huddle after a timeout. Security stepped in, but Beverley and the fan continued to exchange words. Leading up to the Bucks guard throwing the ball twice, The Athletic reports that obscenities were shouted at Beverley, which led to the escalation of the situation.\n\nBeverley responded to the video on social media, saying it was \"not fair\" and that the Bucks \"asked for help all night\" about one of the fans behind the bench.\n\nDoc Rivers said he talked to Beverley about him throwing the ball, and while he understood that the fans were saying inappropriate things, that doesn't give him the right to do what he did.\n\n\"So we talked about that and then the ball-throwing incident,\" River said. \"And he made the comment to me about what was being said back his way and I just said, 'I get it, but we're coaches and athletes, we're the entertainers or whatever we are, sometimes they can be in the wrong, but you just can't do those certain things.' And he knows that as well.\"\n\nBeverley did not receive any discipline for his actions during the game but could face punishment now that the league is reviewing the matter. It also wasn't the only incident Beverley was involved in Thursday night. Following the loss, Beverley denied an ESPN producer, Malinda Adams, from joining in on his postgame media scrum because she did not subscribe to his podcast. After asking if she subscribes to his podcast, to which Adams replied she does not, Beverley said, \"You can't interview me then, no disrespect.\" When Adams remained next to him, Beverley moved her microphone while asking, \"Can you get that mic out of my face, please?\" After she remained close to record the interview, Beverley then said, \"Can you move that mic, please, or just get out the circle, please, for me? Please ma'am? You're not subscribed to my pod.\" After that, Adams then moved away.\n\nHere's how the interaction unfolded:\n\nWith the league also looking into this incident, Beverley could receive a fine for refusing to talk to a media member. Adams took to social media on Friday to share that Beverley called her to apologize for the interaction. The Professional Basketball Writers Association also released a statement on the matter, condemning Beverley's behavior.\n\n\"The PBWA is extremely disappointed with the unprofessional conduct of Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley on Thursday night. Disrespecting and singling out a professional journalist who is merely trying to do her job is unacceptable.\n\nWe are proud of the many strong working relationships our members have with players, coaches and executives throughout the league. And while heated moments happen and are expected in our business, this type of behavior is atypical and should not be a part of any workplace.\n\nWe are please to hear that Beverley and the Bucks organization have apologized to ESPN's Malinda Adams. As Adams herself wrote on social media, \"Kindness and grace always win.\"\n\nRivers said he also talked to Beverley about this incident, and was glad that he called without having to be told by the Bucks organization to do so.\n\n\"I did [have a conversation with Beverley],\" Rivers said. \"I did right away because that's not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way. We're better than that. Pat feels awful about that. He also understands this is an emotional game and things happen. Unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him. So, I'm glad that he called, that didn't come from us. We talked about things you just can't do and so I'm glad that he called because that call came from him, not us telling him to make that call. That was good. I had not seen that interview. I just heard that that happened.\"\n\nBeverley finished with six points, five assists and two rebounds while going 3-for-11 from the field as the Bucks were sent packing on Thursday night. He was excellent in Milwaukee's Game 5 win on Tuesday, putting up 13 points, 12 assists and two steals. The series was chippy at times, with Bucks big man Bobby Portis being ejected from Game 4 after getting into a shoving match with Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard.\n\nLong known for toeing the line between passion and chaos, Beverley clearly crossed the line with his behavior and will certainly pay a hefty price in some way. Any potential suspension would have to be served next season now that the Bucks have been eliminated from the playoffs. Beverley could also serve a suspension with a new team as the 35-year-old veteran will be an unrestricted free agent this summer.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_ward_henninger@cbssports.com", "name": "Colin Ward-Henninger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Portis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Portis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/03/cd1fd39a-dce4-421d-bbd6-b3725b178b0a/thumbnail/1200x675/3abd24fb61fb537bcba7b79054e831cb/050224-patrickbeverley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

The league described his interaction with ESPN producer Malinda Adams as \"inappropriate.\"\n\nThe incidents occurred at Game 6 of the Bucks' first-round loss to the Pacers last week. Beverley's first throw of the basketball struck a woman in the crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. After getting the ball back, Beverley threw it into the stands again, that time hitting a man.\n\nOn Wednesday, Beverley, 35, released an episode of his \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" in which he addresses the ball-throwing incident, saying a fan heckled him with a name he had never been called before.\n\n\"I have to be better, and I will be better,\" Beverley said. \"That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened.\"\n\nBeverley added the alleged comment was \"more\" than \"Cancun on three,\" a common taunt toward players facing postseason elimination. The Athletic's Shams Charania had reported the situation \"escalated\" after a fan yelled the phrase.\n\nFollowing the loss, which ended the Bucks' season, Beverley asked Adams if she was subscribed to his podcast. When she said she wasn't, Beverley told her, \"You can't interview me then.\"\n\nBeverley then pushed her microphone away and asked her to leave the circle as he addressed other media members.\n\n\"Patrick Beverley just called me and apologized,\" Adams wrote on social media a day after the exchange. \"I appreciate it and accept it. The Bucks also reached out to apologize. I've been in news for over 40 years and kindness and grace always win.\"\n\nBeverley is set to be an unrestricted free agent and would serve the suspension next season. He signed a one-year, minimum contract with the Philadelphia 76ers before the 2023-24 season and was traded to the Bucks in February.\n\nThursday's discipline marks the third suspension for Beverley, who also received a one-game ban in 2021 for shoving Chris Paul and a three-game penalty in 2022 for shoving DeAndre Ayton.\n\nEarlier in the playoffs, the NBA did not discipline 76ers star Joel Embiid for a flagrant-one foul in which he pulled Knicks center Mitchell Robinson to the ground by his legs.\n\nThe NBA fined Denver's Jamal Murray $100,000 for throwing a heat pack and a towel onto the court during Game 2 of the Nuggets' second-round series against the Timberwolves amid frustrations with the officiating. Murray was not suspended.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@nydailynews.com", "name": "Peter Sblendorio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24122582654074.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Beverley defended his actions, but comments to a reporter may not help his case.\n\nPatrick Beverly of the Milwaukee Bucks is currently under police investigation for his altercation with Indiana Pacers fans during Game 6 of their first round matchup, as reported by Shams Charania.\n\nWhile what was actually said during the altercation, along with the possible ramifications from both the league and the law, has still yet to be determined, here's a look back at the incident and what at the very least was caught on camera.\n\nBeverley Got Into It With Pacers Fans Beverley appears to throw a ball at a group of fans multiple times during an argument\n\nDuring the final moments of Game 6 in the first round playoff series between the Indiana Pacers and the Milwaukee Bucks (May 2), Beverley was caught on video appearing to throw a ball at a group of Indiana fans. After the ball strikes a woman in the head, Beverley can be seen asking for the ball to be returned to him.\n\nA man in a Pacers hoodie grabbed the ball and tossed it back to Beverly, who then immediately fired the ball back at said fan. This then prompted a group of Pacers fans to start yelling at Beverley, who by this point had his teammates attempting to defuse the situation.\n\nAfter the game, when taking questions from reporters in the locker room, Beverley asked a reporter standing next to him if she was subscribed to his podcast. When she said that she did not, Beverley refused to take questions from her. While this isn't directly related to his culpability for the incident with the fans, it certainly doesn't help his case.\n\nBeverley, who has a history of alterations with other players, defended his actions on X, stating that it had been an ongoing issue throughout the night. Although this isn't likely to gain him much favor in the eyes of those responsible for determining his guilt, it's still worth noting as details are still being released to the public.\n\nWhile players, fans and commentators of the game have strongly expressed their displeasure in the situation, Beverley's actions seem to have ramifications that are stretching off the court and into tangible consequences for the veteran guard.\n\nRelated Tyrese Haliburton Trolls Patrick Beverley on Social Media Following Game 6 Victory Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton got the last laugh over Patrick Beverley of the Milwaukee Bucks following their first-round playoff battle.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-02-may-2024-10-50-pm-751.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 1069, "textEnd": 1074}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before, but added that his actions were \"still inexcusable.\"\n\n\"I will be better,\" he said. \"I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.\"\n\nBeverley added the atmosphere in Indiana \"was great\" aside from \"a handful of fans\" who crossed the line.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more,\" Beverley said. \"That ... threw my whole vibe off.\"\n\nAfter the game, Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.\n\nThe next day, Adams said on X that she had received apologies from both the Bucks and from Beverley himself.\n\nOn his podcast, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that \"it was never my intent to disrespect you.\"\n\nA day after the game, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was \"not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.\"\n\n\"We're better than that,\" Rivers said. \"Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"\n\nThe Bucks acquired the 35-year-old Beverley from the Philadelphia 76ers at the trade deadline. Beverley was playing on a one-year deal, making him an unrestricted free agent heading into the offseason.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said. I have to be better and I will be better.\"\n\nIt is unclear what the spectator allegedly said to Beverley.\n\nBeverley added that he did not want to take away from the Indiana fans, who he said were \"great\" but that some took it \"a little bit too far.\"\n\nOne day after the loss, Bucks head coach Doc Rivers called Beverley's actions \"not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.\"\n\nRivers added: \"We're better than that. Pat (Beverley) feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally - this is an emotional game and things happen - unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"\n\nThe Bucks went on to lose 120-98, eliminating them from the NBA Playoffs.\n\nBeverley, who just finished his 12th year in the league, was traded to the Bucks from the Philadelphia 76ers in February, and averaged 6.2 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists this season.

You can see the video here.\n\nBeverley spoke about the incident during the latest episode of his podcast, which was released on Tuesday. He said what he did was \"wrong\" and vowed to never let it happen again. However, Beverley said the fan he threw the ball at said a lot more than \"Cancun on 3.\"\n\n\"What I did was bad and that should have never happened. I have to be better and I will be better. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened,\" Beverley said. \"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on 3.' Let's just say it was more than that. I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one. It's still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said. I have to be better and I will be better.\"\n\nA report from The Athletic claimed the fan shouted \"Cancun on 3\" while the Bucks were breaking their sideline huddle. That is a common way of heckling players for their season being over. The report said some other obscenities were directed toward Beverley before that particular taunt.\n\nBeverley said several fans said things to him that would have warranted ejections. He claimed security guards even asked him if he wanted to have certain fans kicked out of the game but that he declined.\n\nThe NBA probably will not care what was said to Beverley, as a player throwing a ball at a fan is a terrible look at best and a potential lawsuit at worst.\n\nBeverley also drew criticism after Game 6 when he refused to speak with an ESPN reporter because she does not subscribe to his podcast.

He did it twice.\"\n\nIn the locker room post-game, Beverley, who shot 3-for-11 for 6 points, then told ESPN producer Malinda Adams that she couldn't interview because she didn't subscribe to his podcast.\n\nThe other reporters in the scrum continued to ask questions and interview Beverly despite his demand.\n\n\"You could move that mic please, or just get out of the circle please, please ma'am, if you're not subscribed to my pod,\" he said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nAdams posted that Beverley later called her to apologize.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663d1d748a36ebaa30b71c2a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 478, "textEnd": 483}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

While on his podcast, the veteran point guard touched on what led to this altercation.\n\nAfter checking out of the game for the last time against the Indiana Pacers, Beverley was seen getting into it was fans sitting courtside. He ended up letting his emotions get the best of them, and threw a ball at them. Beverley struck a woman on the first throw, and then hit another after the ball was given back to him.\n\nWhile speaking about the situation, Patrick Beverley admitted that he cannot be acting like that towards fans. However, what was said was far beyond simple trash talk.\n\n\"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three'\" Beverley said. \"I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one.\"\n\nIn his reporting of what happened, NBA insider Shams Charania reported that the obscenities were said towards Beverley leading up to this exchange. As of now, it has not been said if he will be facing some form of punishment from the league for his actions.\n\nDraymond Green speaks on Patrick Beverley's scuffle with Indiana Pacers fans\n\nSince this incdient happened, countless people in and around the NBA have touched on what Patrick Beverley did. Among those to speak on the situation is Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green.\n\nNot only did Green bring up what Beverley did with Pacers fans, but other instances as well. Most notably, when the veteran guard shoved Chris Paul from behind during the 2021 playoffs.\n\nGreen stated he feels what Beverley did is dangerously close to a player running into the stands to engage with hecklers.\n\n\"Adam is going to have a problem on his hands with this one,\" Green said. \"Because it's about as close as you can get to going in the stands. That is forbidden for us.\"\n\nIt's been quite some time since a player has gone out into the stands to fight with a fan. The most famous instance is the \"Malice at the Palace,\" that happened during a game between the Detroit Pistons and Pacers.\n\nWhile Green is known to let his emotions get the best of him as well, he brings up some points in regards to Patrick Beverley. In recent years, he's had some moments where he lost his cool leading up to elimination. Beverley pushed Paul in the back as the Suns were on the brink of knocking the LA Clippers out of the postseason.\n\nThroughout his career, most of Green's scuffles have been with other players. It's rare that he gets into it with patrons in the crowd.

Cameras showed him sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands, hitting a fan in the head with about 2 \u00bd minutes left. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.\n\nBeverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before, but added that his actions were \"still inexcusable.\"\n\n\"I will be better,\" he said. \"I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.\"\n\nBeverley added the atmosphere in Indiana \"was great\" aside from \"a handful of fans\" who crossed the line.\n\n\"I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more,\" Beverley said. \"That ... threw my whole vibe off.\"\n\nAfter the game, Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.\n\nThe next day, Adams said on X that she had received apologies from both the Bucks and from Beverley himself.\n\nOn his podcast, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that \"it was never my intent to disrespect you.\"\n\nA day after the game, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was \"not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.\"\n\n\"We're better than that,\" Rivers said. \"Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"\n\nThe Bucks acquired the 35-year-old Beverley from the Philadelphia 76ers at the trade deadline. Beverley was playing on a one-year deal, making him an unrestricted free agent heading into the offseason.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

To point out, since Beverley didn't hit his intended target, he fired the ball back into the crowd once again, as it appeared he was trying to hit a Pacers fan who had been apparently trash-talking the Bucks' team for most of the game.\n\nAs reported by Shams Charania, Indianapolis Police are now investigating the incident.\n\nFormer NBA player and TNT analyst Charles Barkley, who has been involved in his fair share of antics throughout his career commented on the situation. \"It doesn't matter who he was trying to hit, you can't hit no lady ever. He hit that lady in the head. I've done stupid stuff, and I've got criticized. That's just wrong, he's going to get suspended for that. And that's going to be a good one too, because he didn't just do it once, he did it twice.\"\n\nThroughout his 12-year career, Beverley has been suspended two other times, but undoubtedly the most punitive punishment is going to be the next one, which will presumably be given out after the investigation is finished being conducted.\n\nTo make matters worse, and what commissioner Adam Silver will take into consideration when deciding on the length of his suspension, this is not Beverley's first time throwing a ball into the crowd. That is to say, while a member for the Clippers, on October 22, 2019, in a game vs. the Lakers, Beverley tossed a ball into the stands at Staples Center and jokingly stated after the victory, \"Fans were so great, tried to give the GAME BALL!! SORRY.\" Notably, after this incident, he was fined $25,000 by the league office, which means a justifiable penalty will certainly be much steeper this time around, considering there was ill-intent in regards to what took place in Indiana's Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nAfter the video of Beverley hitting a fan with the ball went viral, Beverley took to social media to give his side of the story on X.\n\nMany were wondering what exactly prompted Beverley to lose his temper and throw a fastball into the area of innocent fans. Well Shams reported that the events unfolded as a result of an Indiana fan taunting the third-seeded Bucks' and their first-round exit from the playoffs, seemingly insinuating the team will go on an early off-season trip to Cancun after the series loss.\n\nIncluding the regular season, In-Season Tournament, and postseason, the Pacers went 8-3 vs. the Bucks this year, including winning the first-round playoff series, thereupon indeed sending Milwaukee on an early summer vacation.\n\nTo also mention, in a separate incident that same night, Beverley had an awkward encounter with ESPN's field producer Malinda Adams. With attention to Beverley's behavior during an interaction with Adams in the postgame interview, he is now banned from making any future guest appearances on ESPN.\n\nBeverley declared, \"You can't interview me then, no disrespect.\"\n\nAdams didn't give up, as she tried to keep the mic within distance, while the Bucks' player was answering questions, but that is when Beverley saw her out of the corner of his eye and then forced Adams to get out of the locker room.\n\n\"Move that mic please or just get out the circle please for me, please ma'am, if you not subscribed to my pod.\"", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/patrick-beverley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-22", "textStart": 1465, "textEnd": 1481}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Below is previous coverage on May 3, 2024, from The Associated Press.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Milwaukee Bucks guard Pat Beverley indicated a video showing him throwing a ball at a spectator on Thursday was misleading but later added that \"I have to be better.\"\n\nCameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands and hitting a fan with about 2 \u00bd minutes left in Milwaukee's 120-98 Game 6 loss at Indiana that knocked the Bucks out of the playoffs. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.\n\nBeverley declined to answer a question about it while speaking to reporters after the game. But he replied to an X post that showed the video by saying, \"Not Fair at all. Exchanged between a fan and our ball club all night. We warned and asked for help all night. Not fair.\"\n\nSix hours later, Beverley issued another X post saying, \"But I have to be better. And I will.\"\n\nAlso during his postgame media session, Beverley wouldn't allow a particular journalist to ask a question after discovering that she didn't subscribe to his podcast. He told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.\n\nThe journalist was identified on social media as ESPN producer Malinda Adams. She tweeted Friday that Beverley called her and apologized.\n\n\"I appreciate it and accept it,\" she said in her tweet. \"The Bucks also reached out to apologize.\"\n\nBucks coach Doc Rivers said Friday he had spoken to Beverley.\n\n\"That's not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way,\" Rivers said. \"We're better than that. Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"\n\nRivers said Beverley called Adams on his own without being told to do so by the Bucks.\n\n\"I had not seen that interview,\" Rivers said. \"I just heard that that happened. So we talked about that and then the ball-throwing incident. And he made the comment to me about what was being said back his way and I just said, 'I get it, but we're coaches and athletes, we're the entertainers or whatever we are. Sometimes they can be in the wrong, but you just can't do those certain things.' And he knows that as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wishtv.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pat-Beverley-throws-ball-at-Pacers-fans-later-tells-reporter-to-leave-his-locker-room-interview-scaled-e1714763043615.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

McConnell (9) defends during game six of the first round for the 2024 NBA playoffs at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Mandatory Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDespite an exhilarating postseason going on, it is the Patrick Beverley incident that has sent shockwaves around the NBA. For the uninitiated, Beverley refused to be interviewed by a reporter who was not subscribed to his podcast after the Game 6 loss to the Indiana Pacers. Now, with multiple players and analysts weighing in, the NBA radio show host is livid too, but not at Pat Bev. Instead, he has a bone to pick with the rest of the reporters standing there.\n\nPatrick Beverley's impolite and ill-mannered behavior towards ESPN's Malinda Adams has been under the spotlight since the incident occurred. And among the many who shared their strong opinions on the matter, was Amin Elhassan. Speaking on Sirius XM Radio, the following is what he had to say on the matter.\n\n\"I'm more disappointed in all the media people and the PR people who are present, that allowed that to happen. Who allowed that to happen. Who didn't say, 'Alright Pat, it's cool. No, you're good Melinda, answer the question.' Or other media people, 'Pat, just answer the question man. And I'm asking the question. Why are you worried about whether she's standing there or not.'\"\n\n\"Nobody did that. Felt like that was very cowardly from everybody in question...For the other people standing there and witnessing it? Shameful, shameful. You oughta be ashamed. You gotta go home and be like, 'Man, I got no guts.'\"\n\nAmin was not happy with the fact that no one stood up for Malinda Adams and just witnessed Patrick Beverley disrespecting her. He even mentioned how it was another reporter who had asked the question and not Adams. And the other media spokesperson should've intervened by saying it wasn't her who asked the question so how does it matter if she was standing there or not?\n\nThe NBA radio host mentioned that the Milwaukee Bucks did call and apologize, along with a personal apology from Patrick Beverley as well. However, the damage has already been done and Pat Bev has been banned from any ESPN segments along with making a guest appearance on any ESPN show from now on.\n\nFollowing the unfolding of the incident and its consequences, Patrick Beverley would come out and release his verdict on the whole situation. Admittedly, it played to a tune anybody would just about expect.\n\nPatrick Beverley did address the fans and the media after the whole incident occurred in the locker room. He sent out a tweet on X saying, \"But I have to be better. And I will,\" followed by a hands-joined together and a heart emoji.\n\nHe even shed some light on what happened between him and the fan when he threw the ball at him while sitting on the bench.\n\n\"Not Fair at all. Exchanged between a fan and our ball club all night. We warned and asked for help all night. Not fair.\"\n\nBeverley claims that the fan was heckling him and the rest of the squad who was on the bench. His tweet states that the fan was warned multiple times and the team even asked for help from the arena's security but to no avail and that is what led him to take matters into his own hands.\n\nNow, whether Pat Bev is speaking the truth or just trying to save face is unclear. But again, the damage has been done and the league has already launched an investigation over what exactly took place between Beverley and the fan.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what the league's investigation uncovers and where the chips will land for Patrick Beverley. But when it's all said and done, Beverley may have to do a lot more than issue a cryptic apology on X to get back on the good side of the fans and media.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_dhariwal@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Abhishek Dhariwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe National Basketball Association moved to suspend Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley on Thursday. The NBA made this decision after Beverley got involved in a hostile encounter with fans and an inappropriate reaction with a reporter after the Bucks' loss to the Indiana Pacers.\n\nAfter those incidents, the NBA suspended Beverley for four games.\n\nThe league announced Beverley's suspension in a press release Thursday afternoon.\n\nMarc Spears was among those to report on the suspension.\n\nGranted, a four-game suspension for these incidents feels quite lower than anticipated. The league definitely did not come down hard on Beverley, who dealt with quite a troublesome week after the incident with an ESPN producer.\n\nWhile it's true that some could argue that this is a deterrent, it's not a very strong one. Again, only four games following an incident with a fan and a reporter feels very light. You wonder if the NBA could have come down harder on him, and some out there appeared to have that same sentiment.\n\nBeverley won't begin his suspension next season since the Bucks are out of the NBA Playoffs.

It was initially reported that Beverley was annoyed by fans saying \"Cancun on three\" at the end of the game.\n\nIt's a clear joke referencing the Bucks being eliminated and headed for vacation. Well, Pat Bev is now claiming there's more to the story. Something so sinister that he can't get into it.\n\n\"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three.'...Let's just say it was more than that. I've been called a lot of stuff in this league.

Instead, the Bucks guard took responsibility and then immediately implied something horrible was said to him by multiple people. Are there any witnesses to that? Are there any videos? Have his teammates backed up this narrative? As far as I can tell, the answer to all those questions is no.\n\nMaybe something will come out. Maybe not.

The Bucks guard, known for his aggressive playstyle, had a night filled with controversies as the Indiana Pacers eliminated his team from the playoffs. Beverley, who often engages in trash-talking, was seen throwing a ball not once but twice at fans standing behind the Bucks bench. His post-game behavior was equally unexpected. He expelled a reporter from the locker room for not subscribing to his podcast. The situation has taken a serious turn, with the police now involved in the ball-throwing incident.\n\nThe NBA player is currently being investigated by Indianapolis police. They have stated that they are looking into the ball-throwing incident involving Patrick Beverley. A representative for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed that, on May 2, after Beverley threw a basketball at Indiana fans twice during the Bucks' playoff game against the Pacers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, investigators did in fact file a case report. The representative claims that the report was subsequently sent to investigators. The investigators are currently attempting to obtain additional video from the arena and speak with those who were involved. The representative went on to say that as soon as the investigation is complete, detectives are supposed to forward their results to prosecutors.\n\nPatrick Beverley has not yet made any public comments regarding the criminal inquiry, although he did apologize for his acts and labeled them \"inexcusable\" earlier this week on his podcast, \"The Pat Bev Podcast with Rone.\" He explained that he did it because the trash talk by fans within the arena went too far. However, he restated that he ought not to have thrown the ball into the crowd. There has still not been a punishment from the NBA, which may be waiting for the criminal investigation to be completed.\n\nPatrick Beverley went too far. When Draymond Green is saying you went too far, you went too far. Beverley has a history of being a sore loser and letting his emotions get the better. Just ask Chris Paul. Hopefully, the investigation isnt too severe as it was just a ball. Overall, it would be a shame for this to get blown out of proportion. The NBA should suspend and fine him and call it a day.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamil_david@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Jamil David", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/05/GettyImages-2151273160-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 851, "textEnd": 856}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Patrick Beverley's actions after the Game 6 loss to the Pacers have caught much wind among basketball circles. Denying a reporter privilege to interview him just because she hasn't subscribed to his podcast may not have been the way to go as a former All-Star reacts to the ordeal.\n\nJeff Teague recently touched upon the Patrick Beverley saga on the Club 520 Podcast. The co-hosts mentioned that if Draymond Green ended up doing a whole segment on what took place, one should know that they messed up.\n\nTeague was made aware of the fact that Patrick Beverley is now banned from all ESPN shows and events and how it will come back to cost him.\n\n\"He f**ked up. But I didn't like it anyway though cuz it's at the end of the game. And if would've done it as a joke like, 'You subscribed to my podcast? Don't put your mic in my face.' But then she put the mic in his face he was like, 'I ain't f**king with you.'\"\n\n\"Bro, we ain't that important. We just athletes bro. At the end of the day, it's gonna be somebody taking our spot...Ain't no point being a d**khead to nobody...At the end of the day, you got a short window...I love Pat Bev. But in a year or two, nobody gonna give a f**k about him playing basketball.\"\n\nEven though Jeff Teague has love for Patrick Beverley, he wasn't happy with how he conducted himself with the reporter from ESPN. He mentioned it would've been different had Beverley only fooled around, but he took it to another level entirely.\n\nThe former All-Star also took into consideration how players aren't that important. Had Patrick Beverley been a star player, who would've been great for years to come, things might've been different. Instead, what he did would end up costing him, and given the type of player Pat Bev is, nobody is going to be asking about him in a couple of more years, as he only has a short window left in the league.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Patrick Beverley stooped down to such a level. The Milwaukee Bucks point guard did the same thing with the hosts of Run It Back, Chandler Parsons and Shams Charania.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure no one, even Shams is not even subscribed to my podcast...It's free...I know you guys might be ignorant, don't know how to follow podcast. I can walk you through a tutorial if you need.\"\n\nThough his interaction with the hosts of Run It Back did not gain enough traction as it did with what happened between PAt Bev and the ESPN reporter now, all his shenanigans are being brought into the spotlight.

This morning, it was reported that the Indianapolis police department was investigating the incident for potential charges being levied at Beverley. Now, the NBA has handed down its punishment in the form of a 4-gam suspension. The suspension is also a punishment for Beverley's post-game dismissal of a female reporter from the locker room. Beverley told the reporter to leave the locker room because she did not subscribe to his podcast.\n\nWith Patrick Beverley set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer, his future team is a big question. It also stands to reason that his entire NBA future is uncertain. He is an older player with a lot of baggage and teams will ask if he is worth the headache. In the event that he moves on, it becomes apparent that the upcoming suspension will prevent him from making his new team's debut straight away. An investigation is taking place, and the Indianapolis police are set on following through and doing their due diligence.\n\nRead More: Patrick Beverley Investigated By Police After Throwing Ball At Fan\n\nPatrick Beverley did apologize for his acts and labeled them \"inexcusable\" earlier this week on his podcast, \"The Pat Bev Podcast with Rone.\" He explained that he did it because the trash talk by fans within the arena went too far. However, he restated that he ought not to have thrown the ball into the crowd. Patrick Beverley will now serve a 4-game suspension for both the act of throwing a ball at fans twice and disparaging a reporter after the game. Beverley might need to take up podcasting full-time. He is an unrestricted free agent after the season. Overall, it's a big question mark where he will play next.\n\nIf he gets a minimum deal again next season -- which is expected to be $3.3 million -- he would lose almost $90,000 as a result of the ban. This isn't the first time he has been suspended. During a blowout defeat to the Phoenix Suns in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals in 2021, Beverley shoved Chris Paul in the back as both players were making their way to their benches. As a result, he received a one-game ban while still a member of the LA Clippers.

Mandatory Credit: David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPatrick Beverley has caught fire among numerous NBA fans because of his actions at the end of Game 6 between the Bucks and the Pacers. As his Bucks were being eliminated, the upset guard threw the ball at Pacers fans, not once but twice. This caused major backlash towards the Bucks guard, who defended himself by saying that the fans had been hurling abuses at him and the Bucks bench had even requested the removal of the fans. However, he didn't issue any public apology in the aftermath.\n\nOn his 'Pat Bev' podcast with Rone, Beverley has finally accepted that he shouldn't have thrown the ball toward the fans. He claimed that some of the fans had crossed the line and instigated him to react.\n\nDespite the fans' taunts, he confessed that it was \"wrong\" to throw the ball at them and promised that he would enhance his behavior,\n\n\"I have to be better and will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.\"\n\nHis co-host revealed that Shams Charania had reported that Beverley was perturbed by the \"Cancun on 3\" remarks, which are fairly mild in the NBA sphere. However, the All-Defensive talent claimed that it was much more than these remarks and some fans \"took it too far\". He also revealed that when security asked him to remove the fans, he refused to call for their ouster,\n\n\"I'm not the guy to get fans kicked out neither. The things that were said to me, I could have got 4 or 5 fans kicked out. Literally, security walked up to me,\"You wanna get that guy thrown out', I'm like,'Nah man'\".\n\nDespite these clarifications, the story of Beverley's aggressive behavior remains complicated. Nasty name-calling and taunts are common during NBA games, especially in the postseason, and as a veteran, Beverley knows this side of the business. This is why another one of his actions drew even fiercer criticism.\n\nDuring the post-game interview, Beverley refused to answer ESPN field producer Malinda Adams. He rebuked her for \"not subscribing\" to his podcast. The 35-year-old rudely directed her to put the mic away and \"move out of the circle\".\n\nThis move by Beverley drew vehement criticism from ESPN journalists and prominent NBA figures, who told him that Adams has been in the media space for more than three decades.\n\nWhile he addressed the ball-throwing incident, he also needs to touch upon his questionable attitude towards Malinda Adams. He will probably discuss it later in his pod but as of now, he is under fire for his conduct. ESPN has already banned him from their shows and he now has no access to the media giant.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bucks guard will face severe repercussions from the NBA administration. Not only did he intimidate fans after a game, but he also broke the media guidelines.

During the tail end of the game, the veteran defender aggressively threw a basketball at Pacers fans sitting behind the Milwaukee bench, not once but twice. Later on, during post-game interviews in the locker room, the Bucks star asked ESPN producer Malinda Adams to leave his vicinity because she wasn't subscribed to his podcast. Many felt that Pet Bev was frustrated after a 3/11 shooting night and his squad's disappointing season.\n\nHowever, Jeff Teague doesn't believe that his actions stemmed from the playoff exit. In fact, Teague \"swore by his right hand\", that Beverley doesn't feel that deeply about losing. On his 520 Club pod, the 2021 NBA champion said to his co-hosts that the Bucks guard wasn't as flustered as he appeared in the aftermath of the playoff exit.\n\n\"I swear on my right hand of God that he ain't that dedicated bro. He wasn't that mad they lost bro. Couldn't be bro, swear to god. Y'all... you wasn't that mad,\" Teague said.\n\nThese comments by the former Hawks guard only lead to more confusion. If Beverley \"wasn't that mad\", then why did he lash out at the Pacers fans? Was Teague implying that Beverley feigned his anger? If so, for what reason? Well, Teague provided no further explanations for his beliefs.\n\nOne possible explanation can be that Pat Bev wanted to create a ruckus before ending his season to create more intrigue toward his podcast. Now that everybody's talking about his actions, certainly a lot of people will tune into the 35-year-old's podcast to check out his views on the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Beverley defended his actions by stating that the Pacers fans had been shouting NFSW words at his squad. They had asked the security to remove the fans on numerous occasions. Regardless of the defense, these actions have surely displeased Charles Barkley who has himself been involved in numerous spats with fans.\n\nBarkley disapproved of Beverley's actions and declared that hitting a woman under any circumstance is a no-no. He felt that the Bucks guard crossed a line when he decided to throw the basketball at a woman violently, even if he intended to hit someone else. \"Oh, he hit that lady in the head...He gone. He's going to get suspended,\" Barkley remarked when he viewed the footage of the tense exchange.\n\nCharles Barkley was involved in various fan-related incidents during his playing days. In one of the most infamous instances, he accidentally spat on the face of an eight-year-old girl named Lauren Porecca. While admitting his wrongdoings of the past, he opined that Beverley deserves criticism for his actions.\n\n\"Listen, I've done stupid stuff and I got criticized. That's just wrong. He's gonna get suspended for that. And that's gonna be a good one, too. 'Cause he didn't do it once. He did it twice,\" Chuck added.\n\nBarkley wasn't the only athlete who ripped into Patrick Beverley. The Bucks' PG has drawn ceaseless criticism from various prominent NBA voices. Meanwhile, fans aren't letting go of any chance to troll him on his X account as well. However, the NBA hasn't announced any penalty for the Bucks star.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/79ec544f-nba-2024-05-06t220706.081.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

A similar gesture by Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert in a regular season game in March drew a $100,000 fine from the league.\n\nMurray, who has been flummoxed by a strained left calf, a lost shooting touch and a paucity of whistles going his way, left Ball Arena without speaking to reporters after Games 1 and 2.\n\nHe met with the media after practice Wednesday but didn't have much to say about his actions that endangered players on both teams and Marc Davis' officiating crew or the fine issued by the league.\n\n\"Nah, I mean it is what it is and I take everything in full responsibility, so on to the next,\" Murray said when asked whether he had expected the fine and if he felt his punishment was appropriate.\n\nAsked for an explanation of his actions, Murray said, \"Yeah, on to the next. I mean, two days ago, not much for me to say about it right now.\"\n\nWhen asked about issuing an apology or taking responsibility, Murray cut off the line of questioning by asking, \"Do you have any basketball questions?\"\n\nMurray acknowledged the Nuggets lost their collective composure Monday night when the Wolves hounded them into a 35% shooting performance even though their best defender, Rudy Gobert, who won the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award on Tuesday, was back in Minneapolis for the birth of his son.\n\n\"We've just got to be ready to play and not get frustrated with how the game goes sometimes and we allowed it to take us out of our game,\" Murray said. \"So, we've just got to stay composed and find a way to stick together during the game and figure it out. No matter what the scoreboard says, we've got to be able to claw back.\"\n\nThe towel Murray threw landed at the heels of Davis on the baseline but the heat pack skidded across the floor just as Karl-Anthony Towns was going for a lay-up.\n\nWolves coach Chris Finch called Murray's actions \"inexcusable and dangerous,\" saying somebody easily could have gotten hurt.\n\n\"I've never seen that from Jamal. That was very uncharacteristic,\" Malone said, attributing Murray losing his cool to \"taking a charge and it's not called, not making shots at the level we know he's capable of making, being down 30 points to a team that we're trying to beat to get to the Western Conference finals.\n\n\"So when you put it all in the boiling pot, that's a lot to handle. And he didn't handle it the way he knows he needs to handle it, and I'm sure he told you guys that.\"\n\nComing off the first NBA championship in franchise history, the Nuggets have shown a fatigue in these playoffs that has plagued previous champions.\n\nUnlike last year when they coasted at the end of the regular season with the top seed in the West already secured, the second-seeded Nuggets jockeyed with Minnesota and Oklahoma City until the final weekend of the season.\n\nMurray missed 23 games this season with a variety of lower body injuries and the constant double teams that opponents threw at Nikola Jokic is evident in the scars on his upper arms.\n\nIt's not just health but slow starts that have plagued the reigning champs ever since the playoffs began.\n\nThey've trailed by large margins in all seven of their postseason games. They bounced back against the Lakers to win in five, with Murray hitting a pair of game-winning buckets. But they've been bamboozled by Minnesota's swarming defense, size advantage and deeper bench and now have to beat rising star Anthony Edwards four times in five tries to make it to the Western Conference finals.\n\nMalone said he showed his team nine clips of Game 2 \"that kind of encapsulated that game and why we lost. And our players owned it. And my greatest challenge to them and I don't have an answer for whoever's going to ask me do these guys believe? I don't know. They all say they do but we will all find out collectively come Friday night.\"\n\nBeverley calls his actions 'inexcusable'\n\nIndianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an \"NBA player and citizen\" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Pacers.\n\nPolice said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives, \"who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.\"\n\nDetectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation, the release stated.\n\nCameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands, hitting a fan in the head with about 2 \u00bd minutes left in the game on May 2. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.\n\nBeverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before, but added that his own actions were \"still inexcusable.\"\n\n\"I will be better,\" he said. \"I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.\"\n\nBeverley added the atmosphere in Indiana \"was great\" aside from \"a handful of fans\" who crossed the line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98, eliminating Milwaukee from the playoffs.\n\n\"I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more,\" Beverley said. \"That ... threw my whole vibe off.\"\n\nAfter the game, Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.\n\nOn his podcast Wednesday, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that \"it was never my intent to disrespect you.\"\n\nA day after the loss, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was \"not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.\"\n\n\"We're better than that,\" Rivers said. \"Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally - this is an emotional game and things happen - unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"", "source": {"uri":

He tossed the ball at a man he'd been jawing with, missed his target, and hit the woman. The 35-year-old guard received the ball back after a fan returned it, but Beverley threw it back at the fans out of rage.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, an off-duty officer was present at Gainbridge Fieldhouse the night Beverley tossed the ball and brought forward details from his first-hand account.\n\n\"Detectives are working with Gainbridge Fieldhouse to review video footage and plan to speak with the parties involved,\" The Athletic relayed Wednesday.\n\n\"The report has been forwarded to IMPD detectives, who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously,\" IMPD said in a statement. Filing for an investigation was submitted last Thursday, according to The Athletic.\n\nThe IMPD spokesperson noted that following the department's investigation, Beverley's case will be presented to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nAccording to Beverley's side of the story, the fans shouted 'obscenities' at him and his teammates.

Indiana eliminated Milwaukee from the NBA Playoffs, so they have to watch the rest from their couch. But once next season starts, Beverley will have to sit on the bench.

Not having one to fall back on hurt the team many times throughout the season, and it was especially evident during their playoff loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nDevin Booker and Bradley Beal are both brilliant players - but with neither being a ball-handler first and foremost - the team didn't have a player to fall back on to settle things down when times got tough. Add in Beal's injury struggles, and it made trying to win games harder than it should have been. Even head coach Frank Vogel tried to show us how imbalanced this roster was during the campaign.\n\nThe Suns won't have much money to remedy the situation this summer, but they absolutely need to avoid even thinking about adding Patrick Beverley to the mix.\n\nBeverley is one of the most divisive players in the entire league - and at 35-years-old - whatever prime he did have in the NBA is now gone. During the regular season he played with both the Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks, somehow wearing out his stay with two contenders over the span of about 70 games.\n\nThe 76ers were in freefall after injury to their superstar Joel Embiid, yet they still had no problem letting Beverley go to the Bucks. Once there he disgraced himself as the team bowed out of the playoffs to the Indiana Pacers in the opening round of the playoffs. Both by throwing a basketball at Pacers fans (which he has since apologized for) and doing this for some reason to a reporter.\n\nWhy then would the Suns have any interest in the Patrick Beverley experience? Put simply, because they are desperate. This is the same organization that by season's end had Isaiah Thomas on their roster, and who will once again have to cobble together a rotation with minimum contracts this offseason.\n\nBeverley is an unrestricted free agent, and he signed a minimum deal to join the 76ers last season. He is most certainly going to be available, and coach Vogel (if he remains with the franchise) may see the loud bark of Beverley and think he can turn him into some sort of asset on the defensive end of the court. That would be a massive mistake.\n\nIt speaks volumes that the Suns would arguably be better taking another look at Thomas, than they would be kicking the tyres on Beverley. If nothing else, Thomas appeared to be popular with his teammates, the coaching staff and fans once he came back to The Valley having been with the organization in the past.\n\nBeverley has no such affection from fans throughout the league, and the last thing Booker, Beal and Kevin Durant need is any more drama and talking points around this roster next season. Instead what they need is a floor general who is quietly going to put the expensive pieces together, and help get the Suns closer to contention.\n\nNot only is Beverley not the player to do this, but he's averaged just over three assists throughout his career to this point. Hardly the kind of table setting that this group really needs, while in the playoffs that number has dipped slightly to 2.9 assists in 71 games. He's a just about passable 37.1 percent 3-point shooter, but again that's not what the Suns need from their point guard.\n\nThey want quiet consistency, and an ability to know when to get out of the way when their stars start to cook. All Beverley has going for him is the fact the Suns could afford him - and really if that's your most impressive selling point - then you know it is a bad idea. As the offseason unfolds and Beverley remains sitting there, the Suns have to continue to look the other way for a solution.", "source": {"uri": "valleyofthesuns.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Valley of the Suns"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_duffy@valleyofthesuns.com", "name": "Luke Duffy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8640,h_4860,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/69/01hxce7cs99c1kd9fmzq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

I've been called a lot of stuff in this league, I haven't been called that one. Still inexcusable, it doesn't matter what was said. I have to be better and I will be better,' he reiterated.\n\nPatrick Beverly addressed his unsportsmanlike conduct during the Bucks' elimination\n\nThe guard was seen launching a ball at Pacers fans multiple times during Game 6\n\nBeverly went on to note that he doesn't believe in having people who paid to watch a game get kicked out - even if they 'took it a little bit too far.'\n\n'I'm not the guy to get fans kicked out neither, the things that were said to me, I could have got four, five fans kicked out,' the 35-year-old claimed.\n\n'Literally, security walked up to me. \"You wanna get that fan thrown out?\" You can say anything when you winning, that's what happens when you win, you can literally say anything,' he went on.\n\nThe Bucks star let his emotions boil over as they were knocked out of the playoffs by the Pacers\n\nThe 35-year-old had to be held back by his teammates while stunned fans watched on\n\n'People who spend money to watch us play. I'm not getting them kicked out.'\n\nBeverly also revealed that everyone who 'said something too crazy' to him eventually apologized, but he won't be 'bringing a basketball on the bench no more.'\n\nAs the Pacers sealed their series win with a 120-98 Game 6 victory over the Bucks Thursday, Beverley aggressively threw the ball at Indiana fans sitting a few rows back from the team bench.\n\n'It's an unfortunate situation that should have never happened' Beverly admitted on the pod\n\nHe claimed the fans 'crossed a line' while taunting him, and could have been kicked out\n\nAfter a woman was hit in the side of the head, he demanded the ball back from another fan, before immediately chucking it back at him with force.\n\nThe furious guard was held back by his teammates as the stunned Pacers fans watched on in disbelief.\n\nBeverley did not receive any discipline for his actions during the game, however commissioner Adam Silver later confirmed the NBA was investigating the incident\n\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks alum is yet to address a now-viral clip of himself dismissing a female ESPN reporter in a post-game press conference because she did not subscribe to his podcast.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Razorbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Razorbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/07/20/84580627-0-image-m-77_1715110957551.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He acknowledged the incident as \"unfortunate\" and admitted to his wrongdoing, stating that it should never have occurred. \"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened, regardless of what was said, simple as that.\" While speaking about what caused him to throw the ball at fans he didn't go too much into detail but he said the situation stemmed from fans \"talking to me crazy\"\n\nRELATED: Twitter Reacts To Jordan Poole's Dad Calling Draymond Greene A 'Soft A** B*tch'\n\nAs we previously reported, when questioned about the incident during a post-game interview with reporters, Beverley chose not to respond. However, he did comment on a social media post that featured the video, stating, \"Not fair at all. Exchanges between a fan and our team occurred throughout the night. We repeatedly asked for assistance and warnings all night. It is not fair.\" 6 hours later, Beverly also added another post saying, \"But I have to do better and I will.\" During his postgame media session, Beverley refused to allow a specific journalist to ask a question after learning that she had not subscribed to his podcast.\n\nHe instructed her to remove her microphone from his face and eventually requested her to leave the interview circle.\n\n\"That's not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way,\" Buck coach Doc Rivers spoke out and stated about the situation. \"We're better than that. Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately, you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\"\n\nRELATED: Watch: Devin Booker Left With Bloody & Swollen Nose After Collision With Clippers' Star Patrick Beverley\n\nHe added, \"I had not seen that interview,\" Rivers said. \"I just heard that that happened. So we talked about that and then the ball-throwing incident.

It's not entirely clear how the league came to the conclusion that Beverley got four games. For example, Jamal Murray threw objects near a referee and technically didn't get anything but a substantial fine.\n\nIt is nonetheless a well-deserved punishment for someone who dangerously threw things at fans and made all the wrong headlines in a nationally televised spot.\n\nThe real rub of this suspension is that Beverley's contract with the Bucks is up. He is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the age of 35.

However, the Bucks' disappointment was overshadowed by an incident involving their guard, Patrick Beverley, who found himself in a heated confrontation with several Pacers fans during Game 6.\n\nWith a little over two minutes remaining in the game, cameras caught the fiery guard throwing a ball into the stands, which hit a woman. Then, after asking for the ball back, Pat threw it again, this time with more force, hitting another fan.\n\nThe veteran guard recently went on \"The Pat Bev Podcast\" and gave his take on the incident, calling it an \"unfortunate situation that should've never happened.\"\n\nEmotions ran high\n\nUnlike other major sports in America, the lines separating NBA players and fans are thin, with players constantly being close to fans during games. This unique proximity can lead to unpredictable and sometimes volatile interactions. As the infamous \"Malice at the Palace\" showed, chaos can ensue if that line is crossed. In Game 6, it appears the former Arkansas standout crossed that line by chucking the ball at fans, an act he acknowledged as \"bad.\"\n\n\"What I did was bad, and that should have never happened. I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened, regardless of what was said, simple as that,\" the native of Chicago said.\n\nAn NBA experience is unique. Aside from the exciting action on the floor, there's much to see and hear from the stands. With this being the postseason, emotions can run high, leading to intense trash talk between players and fans, something the raucous guard has engaged in before. However, there is a line that should not be crossed, and PatBev relayed that some fans definitely crossed it.\n\n\"Let's just say it was more than 'Cancun on three.' I've been called a lot of stuff in this league. I haven't been called that one,\" Beverley reported. \"Still inexcusable. It doesn't matter what was said.\"\n\nWhy he didn't have the fans thrown out\n\nWhile some NBA players turn to security to have unruly fans escorted away from the game, the Bucks guard said he doesn't have it in him to resort to such a tactic, recognizing the hard-earned money it takes to attend NBA games.\n\n\"I'm not the guy to get fans kicked out neither. The things that were said to me, I could have got four or five fans kicked out. Literally, security walked up to me, 'You want to get that fan thrown out?' I said, 'Nah, man.' You can say anything when you win, and that's what happens,\" the three-time All-Defense team member shared.\n\n\"Some people would say, 'Pat, man, you should have gotten him kicked out; that would have never happened.' I'm not getting no fans kicked out. People who spend money to watch us play, I'm not getting them kicked out,\" he added.\n\nBeverley clarified that some fans had gone out of line and apologized for their behavior. However, some kept egging him on. Regardless, Pat is remorseful for his actions and now awaits the punishment he'll receive from the league. One thing's for sure: he said he'd never bring a ball to the bench again.", "source": {"uri": "basketballnetwork.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Basketball Network - Your daily dose of basketball"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@basketballnetwork.net", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malice_at_the_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malice at the Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.basketballnetwork.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjkyNTQxOTA0MDA0Mjcy/pat-bev.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

His next team would have to keep him off for four regular season games due to the suspension.\n\nHis suspension could cost him around $90,000 if he signs another minimum contract for next season, which is projected to be $3.3 million, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks.\n\nThe temperamental player was hit with a one-game suspension in 2021 while playing for the Los Angeles Clippers after he shoved Chris Paul during a Game 6 loss to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nBeverly, who just completed his 12th season with the NBA averaged 8.2 points and 5.5 assists across the six games against the Pacers in the playoffs.\n\nThe Utah Jazz in 2022 traded Beverly to the Los Angeles Lakers for forward Stanley Johnson and guard Talen Horton-Tucker.\n\nThe NBA's recent action against Beverly is more severe than its handling of Denver Nuggets point guard Jamal Murray, who on Monday threw a heat pack onto the court during the team's playoff loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nMurray was fined $100,000 but has not been suspended over the incident.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talen_Horton-Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talen Horton-Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/united_press_international_articles_356/a3846c61d4263f4c57bd7a80d85fa1f7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546880", "eventUri": "eng-9546880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 5}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 452993277, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 162, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 162}}}

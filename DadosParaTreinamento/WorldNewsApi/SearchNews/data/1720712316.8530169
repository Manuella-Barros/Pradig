{"id": 231993226, "title": "Video: Former MLB Player Jayson Werth, Co-Owner of Dornoch, Celebrates Win at Belmont", "text": "Former MLB outfielder Jayson Werth is no stranger to athletic achievement and even he had to admit seeing Dornoch win the Belmont Stakes on Sunday felt different. Werth is one of the co-owners of the three-year-old. He couldn't contain his excitement as he watched the horse storm his way to the finish line. \"I would put it right up there with winning on the biggest stage,\" said the 2009 MLB All-Star, who also won a World Series with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008. \"Horse racing is the most underrated sport in the world, bar none. It's the biggest game: You get the Derby, the Preakness, the Belmont. We just won the Belmont. This is as good as it gets in horse racing. It's as good as it gets in sports.\" Dornoch was a 17-1 underdog heading into the race. He placed fourth in the Blue Grass Stakes in April before running 10th in the Kentucky Derby, so he wasn't on the radar for many fans. By the time the Belmont Stakes concluded, Dornoch etched his name into horse racing history. He held off Mindframe and Sierra Leone, both of whom were considered among the strongest contenders, after making the final turn. Dornoch's outsider status probably added to the sense of exhilaration for Werth and his fellow co-owners. Trainer Danny Gargan said he and his team \"always thought\" Dornoch was an elite horse for his age, but believing in the colt's abilities and seeing him actually win a Triple Crown race are two different things. This may not be the last time Werth is celebrating from the owner's box. Gargan left open the possibility for Dornoch to enter another notable race before the season ends.", "summary": "Former MLB outfielder Jayson Werth is no stranger to athletic achievement and even he had to admit seeing Dornoch win the Belmont Stakes on Sunday felt\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124124-video-former-mlb-player-jayson-werth-co-owner-of-dornoch-celebrates-win-at-belmont", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_11,y_0,w_1784,h_1188,c_crop/v1717939796/xpp5sdrnv84sylkcmlda.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:48:42", "author": "Joseph Zucker", "authors": ["Joseph Zucker"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.599}

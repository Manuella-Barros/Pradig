Those who marched from Russell Square to Parliament included children, parents, elderly and the disabled. One speaker on stage estimated at least 150,000 people were there. Marching outside Downing Street, protesters waved flags and placards and chanted slogans including \u201cfree, free Palestine\u201d and \u201cin our thousands, in our millions, we are all Palestinians\u201d. Various speakers, including the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, gave speeches from a stage outside Parliament. Mr Zomlot said: \u201cI am running out of words not only to describe the horror we are witnessing every single day, I am running out of words to help me understand how world leaders, how mainstream media cannot see, cannot report, cannot act. \u201cI have questions. How do they sleep when they see the pictures of skeletal children shaking with fear?\u201d He added: \u201cI know I can\u2019t sleep, I know you can\u2019t sleep. \u201cWhy are those pictures not on your front page every day? How do world leaders justify the starving of 2.3 million people? How do they justify support for a state that is forcing 2.3 million people into death?\u201d Protesters could be heard chanting and clapping in agreement. He later said: \u201cFriends, I am angry, yes I am angry. I fear for my children. I rage, I rage at the world they will grow up in. \u201cBut I also see hope\u2026 I see hope in the unbroken spirit of our people in Gaza.\u201d", "summary": "Various speakers, including the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, gave speeches from a stage outside Parliament.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/gaza-london-parliament-whitehall-downing-street-b1163080.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/16/3b8e26dece79bc2f2f6ebc1f014e7ea6Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTQ3MDIz-2.76453030.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:34:34", "author": "Natasha Leake", "authors": ["Natasha Leake"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.046}

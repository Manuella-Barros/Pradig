Now he\u2019s back. A convicted white-collar crook. Coddling billionaires, leaving workers behind,\u201d reads the sign, which is located on an interstate a few miles from the location of the former president\u2019s upcoming rally, according to Politico. When Trump left office in Jan. 2021, Nevada unemployment was at 8.9 percent \u2014 nearly four points higher than it is now \u2014 and it\u2019s clear the DNC wants to remind voters of that fact. \u201cAfter promising to take care of Nevada\u2019s middle class, he implemented a tax scam that made the ultra-wealthy and corporations wealthier off the backs of working families, repeatedly attacked unions, and sat back as Nevada bled tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d Stephanie Justice, a DNC spokesperson, told Politico. Nevada isn\u2019t the only state where the DNC is trolling Trump with billboards near his rally locations. In Arizona, the party put up a billboard that called Trump \u201cunhinged and unfit.\u201d \u201cTrump already attacked Arizona\u2019s democracy once,\u201d the billboard read. \u201cNow he\u2019s back as a convicted felon. He\u2019s out for revenge and retribution. Trump: unhinged and unfit.\u201d Biden himself called Trump a \u201cconvicted felon\u201d for the first time publicly at a fundraiser in Connecticut last Monday. Other Democratic lawmakers have also used the term, including Reps. Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin. \u201cFor the first time in American history, a former president is convicted \u2014 a convicted felon,\u201d Biden told the audience. \u201cHe\u2019s now seeking the office of the presidency.\u201d Another group, Republican Voters Against Trump, is running billboards of its own that label Trump a \u201cconvicted felon.\u201d Recent poll data hints that Trump\u2019s conviction may be making an impact with voters, which could explain why his opponents are emphasizing it in their messaging. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted shortly after the verdict found that ten percent of Republicans and 25 percent of independents said the conviction made them less likely to vote for Trump. Eighteen percent of independents said they were more likely to vote for Trump following the verdict. The vast majority of Republicans \u2014 approximately nine in ten \u2014 said the verdict would have no effect or would make them more likely to support Trump.", "summary": "\"Coddling billionaires, leaving workers behind,\u201d the sign said of the former president", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/dnc-trump-white-collar-crook-billboard-las-vegas-1235036231/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155379899.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:34:27", "author": "Peter Wade", "authors": ["Peter Wade"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.191}

(AP) -- Millions of people in the central United States must brace themselves for powerful storms that may include long-track tornadoes, hurricane-force winds and baseball-sized hail, forecasters said Monday, issuing a rare high risk warning for central Oklahoma and southern Kansas.\n\nMuch of Oklahoma and parts of Kansas are at the greatest risk of bad weather -- including areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAs early evening approached, ominous wall clouds were forming in Oklahoma, and apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from potential hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water

Much of Oklahoma and parts of Kansas are at the greatest risk of bad weather -- including areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.The National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes. In all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center said. Schools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and cancelled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.Oklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday. Monte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from potential hail and letting his neighbours know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls. Tucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.Bill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring. \"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said. The last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.The risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said. \"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said. Cities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.The number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said. The expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph 49.71 kph, according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\" The high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph 46.60 kph have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.The winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fuelling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office. Colorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.The dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said. \"This is not going to be an atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"The entire week is looking stormy across the US. The eastern US and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.Meanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.

Tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and hail are expected, affecting nearly 10 million people and threatening schools and hospitals. Preparations, including seeking shelter in safe rooms, are crucial. Stormy weather is also expected in Colorado, Kansas City, Springfield, and the eastern US and South throughout the week.\n\nMillions of people in the central United States must brace themselves for powerful storms that may include long-track tornadoes, hurricane-force winds and baseball-sized hail, forecasters said Monday, issuing a rare high risk warning for central Oklahoma and southern Kansas.\n\nMuch of Oklahoma and parts of Kansas are at the greatest risk of bad weather -- including areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring. The National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. Schools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and cancelled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from potential hail and letting his neighbours know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring. \"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,'' he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana. The risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n''If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,'' Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\" The high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday. The winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fuelling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office. Colorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,'' noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. ''The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\" The entire week is looking stormy across the US. The eastern US and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan.

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAs early evening approached, ominous wall clouds were forming in Oklahoma, with funnels emerging from them in rural areas. Meanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from potential hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan.

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "Storm chasers spotted a tornado on the ground Monday in rural Oklahoma while large hail pelted parts of Kansas as forecasters issued a rare high risk warning for the two states with the possibility of long-track twisters.\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nThe storm chasers detected several small funnels emerging from clouds before identifying a twister near the small 1,000-person Oklahoma town of Okeene. No damage was immediately reported, but the National Weather Service warned those in the area to take shelter.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of three inches (7.62 centimetres) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometres) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbours know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the centre is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 m.p.h. (49.71 km/h), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 m.p.h. (46.60 km/h) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fuelling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighbourhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make

Forecasters warn of potentially long-track twisters. Damage has been reported, including large hail in Kansas. Over 3.4 million people in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas are under the highest level of tornado threat. Schools and businesses have closed in Oklahoma, and residents are urged to take shelter. Meteorologists say the risk is the highest in five years, and the storms could produce destructive tornadoes. The dangerous weather is expected to move east, bringing risks to Missouri through Tuesday.\n\nStorm chasers spotted a tornado on the ground Monday in rural Oklahoma while large hail pelted parts of Kansas as forecasters issued a rare high risk warning for the two states with the possibility of long-track twisters.\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring. The storm chasers detected several small funnels emerging from clouds before identifying a twister near the small 1,000-person Oklahoma town of Okeene. No damage was immediately reported, but the National Weather Service warned those in the area to take shelter.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimetres) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. Schools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and cancelled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbours know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the centre is not something seen every day or every spring. \"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,'' he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana. The risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\" The high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday. The winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fuelling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office. Colorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,'' noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. ''The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\" The entire week is looking stormy across the US. The eastern US and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues. Bunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nThe storm chasers detected several small funnels emerging from clouds before identifying a twister near the small 1,000-person Oklahoma town of Okeene. No damage was immediately reported, but the National Weather Service warned those in the area to take shelter.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that heavy rain fell over southeastern Texas, not southwestern Texas.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan.

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes touched down Monday evening in rural Oklahoma and large hail pelted parts of Kansas as an outbreak of dangerous storms brought the possibility of strong twisters staying on the ground for many miles.\n\nForecasters have issued a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states.\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nAt least four tornadoes had been spotted in north central Oklahoma, including one about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service office there issued a tornado emergency alert Monday night for the nearby towns of Bartlesville, Dewey and Barnsdall.\n\nThe Weather Service warned \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward those towns, with wind gusts up to 70 mph.\n\nOther tornadoes had been spotted earlier in the evening near the 1,000-person town of Okeene, while another storm in Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour.\"\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that heavy rain fell over southeastern Texas, not southwestern Texas.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Tornadoes touched down Monday evening in rural Oklahoma and large hail pelted parts of Kansas as an outbreak of dangerous storms brought the possibility of strong twisters staying on the ground for many miles.\n\nForecasters have issued a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes have been spotted in north central Oklahoma, including near the small 1,000-person town of Okeene, while a storm in the nearby town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour.\"\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live.

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas under threat of severe weather, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. Forecasters there issued a rare high risk for central Oklahoma and southern Kansas.\n\nWith the forecast, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts began canceling all after-school and evening activities. Oklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from potential hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan.

(Mike Simons/Tulsa World via AP)\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms battered the Midwest on Tuesday, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes throughout the region a day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person.\n\nTornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nForecasters warned that the storms could stretch late into the night with the possibility of more twisters and large hail.\n\nIn southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo. The city said in a news release that no serious injuries had been reported despite the twisters severely damaging homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the facility at one point because of downed power lines, authorities said. But FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in a nearby mobile home park.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes touched down Monday evening in rural Oklahoma and large hail pelted parts of Kansas as an outbreak of dangerous storms brought the possibility of strong twisters staying on the ground for many miles.\n\nForecasters have issued a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states.\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nAt least four tornadoes had been spotted in north central Oklahoma, including one about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service office there issued a tornado emergency alert Monday night for the nearby towns of Bartlesville, Dewey and Barnsdall.\n\nThe Weather Service warned \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward those towns, with wind gusts up to 70 mph.\n\nOther tornadoes had been spotted earlier in the evening near the 1,000-person town of Okeene, while another storm in Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour.\"\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that heavy rain fell over southeastern Texas, not southwestern Texas.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks - a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said.\n\nAbout a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one person who was still missing, Kelley said. A second missing person was found safe, but injured, at a local hospital, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph).\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nThroughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nTornadoes reported in Oklahoma\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Several Midwest states were bracing for dangerous storms Tuesday as tornadoes spun through parts of Michigan, one day after a powerful twister roared through a small Oklahoma town, killing at least one person and destroying dozens of homes.\n\nThe National Weather Service said some tornadoes were spotted in southwestern Michigan on Tuesday, including two that blitzed parts of Portage, a city just south of Kalamazoo. The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area, while photos posted on Facebook showed severe roof damage at a FedEx building and debris resting on delivery vehicles. It wasn't immediately known if there were injuries.\n\nA tornado watch was also issued Tuesday afternoon for portions of northeast Indiana and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat as those Monday had, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nA deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town.\"\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe weather had soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But it was after dark when tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The city said in a news release that no serious injuries had been reported despite the twisters severely damaging homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the facility at one point because of downed power lines, authorities said. But FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Monday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in a nearby mobile home park.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Weather forecasters warned residents in several Midwest states on Tuesday to brace for dangerous storms, one day after a powerful twister roared through a small Oklahoma town, killing at least one person and destroying dozens of homes.\n\nA tornado watch was issued Tuesday afternoon for portions of northeast Indiana, southern Michigan and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour. Tuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States, ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one man who was still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the damage on Tuesday, said the tornado was rated by weather researchers as an EF4, which is described as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph.

Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power. ... That's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nThe weather soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday.

The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area. A FedEx building was destroyed, debris left resting on delivery vehicles, but a company spokesperson said there were no serious injuries despite the severe damage.\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility as of 9:30 p.m., said Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for the county administrator.\n\n\"First responders are actively looking for ways to get them out, but there are wires down in the building that they need the power company to clear before they can safely go in,\" Koopman said, citing the sheriff's office.\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in the Pavilion Estates mobile home park, she said.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nRELATED: Second tornado in 5 weeks damages Oklahoma town and causes 1 death as powerful storms hit central US\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area, while photos posted on Facebook showed severe roof damage at a FedEx building and debris resting on delivery vehicles. It wasn't immediately known if there were injuries.\n\nA tornado watch was also issued Tuesday afternoon for portions of northeast Indiana and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour.\n\nTuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat as those Monday had, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nA deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town.\"\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe weather had soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But it was after dark when tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nThe storm chasers detected several small funnels emerging from clouds before identifying a twister near the small 1,000-person Oklahoma town of Okeene. The National Weather Service said it was wrapped in rain and hard to see in the dark as it stayed on the ground.\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools, and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Mr. Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Mr. Porter said.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Mr. Bunting said.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Mr. Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Mr. Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the United States. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis, and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki",

The PDS watch in the state last month resulted four deaths and 22 confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAt least four tornadoes had been spotted in north central Oklahoma, including one about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service office there issued a tornado emergency alert Monday night for the nearby towns of Bartlesville, Dewey and Barnsdall.\n\nThe Weather Service warned \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward those towns, with wind gusts up to 70 mph.\n\nOther tornadoes had been spotted earlier in the evening near the 1,000-person town of Okeene, while another storm in Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour.\"\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particularly_Dangerous_Situation",

A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said.\n\nAbout a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nIt later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph.\n\nStitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building.\n\nChunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday.\n\nThe last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90-100 mph damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30-40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75-80 percent of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one or two people who were still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town. ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered across the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph. Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBrian Yazzie helps clean his mother's home after it was damaged by a tornado Tuesday, May 7, 2024 in Barnsdall, Okla.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one or two people who were still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "heraldextra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki",

The city said in a news release that no serious injuries had been reported despite the twisters severely damaging homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the facility at one point because of downed power lines, authorities said. But FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in a nearby mobile home park.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa.

It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph (322 kph).

Tuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States, ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one man who was still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the damage on Tuesday, said the tornado was rated by weather researchers as an EF4, which is described as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient, and we're going to rebuild,\" Stitt said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power. ... That's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nThe weather soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas under threat of severe weather, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. Forecasters there issued a rare high risk for central Oklahoma and southern Kansas.\n\nWith the forecast, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts began canceling all after-school and evening activities.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring. \"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nOther cities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph, according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: A storm system that resulted in mountain snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and heavy rain elsewhere in the West is colliding with a warm and humid air mass coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, Porter said.\n\nSevere weather was possible in southern Kansas after about 4 p.m. Monday. The dangerous weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan early in the day.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one person who was still missing, Kelley said. A second missing person was found safe, but injured, at a local hospital, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph).\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\n___\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTER Associated Press\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A tornado destroyed homes, forced the evacuation of a nursing home and toppled trees and power lines when it roared through a small Oklahoma town, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States amid a series of powerful storms that stretched into Tuesday. At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one or two people who were still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

Tuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States, ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa.

Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community.

The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the damage on Tuesday, said the tornado was rated by weather researchers as an EF4, which is described as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient, and we're going to rebuild,\" Stitt said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power. ... That's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nThe weather soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one or two people who were still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one person who was still missing, Kelley said. A second missing person was found safe, but injured, at a local hospital, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries.

The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nA deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe weather had soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But it was after dark when tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area, while photos posted on Facebook showed severe roof damage at a FedEx building and debris resting on delivery vehicles. It wasn't immediately known if there were injuries.\n\nA tornado watch was also issued Tuesday afternoon for portions of northeast Indiana and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 70 mph (112.65 kph).\n\nTuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat as those Monday had, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nA deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said.

Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe weather had soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But it was after dark when tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.

The city said in a news release that no serious injuries had been reported despite the twisters severely damaging homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the facility at one point because of downed power lines, authorities said. But FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Monday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in a nearby mobile home park.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area. A FedEx building was destroyed, debris left resting on delivery vehicles, but a company spokesperson said there were no serious injuries despite the severe damage.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "Clouds amass over power lines follow days of storms on Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Humble, Texas. (Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nStorm chasers spotted a tornado on the ground Monday in rural Oklahoma while large hail pelted parts of Kansas as forecasters issued a rare high risk warning for the two states with the possibility of long-track twisters.\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nThe storm chasers detected several small funnels emerging from clouds before identifying a twister near the small 1,000-person Oklahoma town of Okeene. The National Weather Service said it was wrapped in rain and hard to see in the dark as it stayed on the ground.\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that heavy rain fell over southeastern Texas, not southwestern Texas.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one person who was still missing, Kelley said. A second missing person was found safe, but injured, at a local hospital, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power. ... That's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nAs soon as they knew they were in the clear, Macedo left the room to find glass and roofing debris littered across the floors.\n\n\"An AC unit went through the first floor on the southern side of the hotel,\" he said.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the Storm Prediction Center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of a few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph).\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area. A FedEx building was destroyed, debris left resting on delivery vehicles, but a company spokesperson said there were no serious injuries despite the severe damage.\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility as of 9:30 p.m., said Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for the county administrator.\n\n\"First responders are actively looking for ways to get them out, but there are wires down in the building that they need the power company to clear before they can safely go in,\" Koopman said, citing the sheriff's office.\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in the Pavilion Estates mobile home park, she said.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type":

Photos posted on Facebook showed severe roof damage at a FedEx building and debris resting on delivery vehicles. It wasn't immediately known if there were injuries.\n\nA tornado watch was issued on Tuesday afternoon for parts of northeast Indiana, southern Michigan and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 112km/h.\n\nTuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat as those on Monday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Centre cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening to early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heatwave.\n\nA deadly tornado that touched down on Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned on Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed towards Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 112km/h. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 145-161km/h damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged on Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it had evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man was missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely levelled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75-80 per cent of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About half a dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search on Tuesday morning to find a man who was still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with it \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us\".\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 64ha wax manufacturing facility in the community had also suffered heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nKevin Stitt, who toured the damage, said the tornado was rated by weather researchers as an EF4, which is described as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 320km/h. Stitt said he and legislative leaders had agreed to set aside US$45 million ($75m) in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient, and we're going to rebuild,\" Stitt said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville about 32km northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his co-worker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power ... that's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nThe weather soured on Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour\", the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas such as Sulphur and Holdenville were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power last month.

And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nOther cities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph, according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: A storm system that resulted in mountain snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and heavy rain elsewhere in the West is colliding with a warm and humid air mass coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, Porter said.\n\nSevere weather was possible in southern Kansas after about 4 p.m. Monday. The dangerous weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan early in the day.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sean Murphy contributed to this report from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\n___\n\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

Forecasters warn that the storms could stretch late into the night as portions of the three states were under a tornado watch.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, and at least one tornado was spotted in Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe town's mayor, Johnny Kelley, said one person died and one man was missing. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one man who was still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the damage on Tuesday, said the tornado was rated by weather researchers as an EF4, which is described as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient, and we're going to rebuild,\" Stitt said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power. ... That's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nThe weather soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Forecasts Warn More Is to Come", "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Powerful storms have erupted in the central United States, bringing tornadoes to rural Oklahoma and large hail in parts of Kansas, with forecasters warning that the dangerous weather could stretch into the early hours of Tuesday amid a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states.\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service said Monday.\n\nGusty winds and heavy rains began Monday afternoon, while tornadoes were spotted after dark skirting northern Oklahoma, including one that touched down about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa. At one point, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe Weather Service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The tornado had ripped off the roof of one house before spitting it back out onto the street. Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOTV that there were no confirmed fatalities as of 11 p.m. local time.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned earlier in the evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe Weather Service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas were under a high-risk weather warning on Monday.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said such a warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Powerful storms have erupted in the central United States, bringing tornadoes to rural Oklahoma and large hail in parts of Kansas, with forecasters warning that the dangerous weather could stretch into the early hours of Tuesday amid a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states.\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service said Monday.\n\nGusty winds and heavy rains began Monday afternoon, while tornadoes were spotted after dark skirting northern Oklahoma, including one that touched down about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa. At one point, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe Weather Service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Severe storms battered parts of the Midwest on Tuesday, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes in the region one day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person.\n\nTornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Forecasters warn that the storms could stretch late into the night as portions of the three states were under a tornado watch.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, and at least one tornado was spotted in Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe town's mayor, Johnny Kelley, said one person died and one man was missing. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas under threat of severe weather, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. Forecasters there issued a rare high risk for central Oklahoma and southern Kansas.\n\nWith the forecast, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts began canceling all after-school and evening activities. Oklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most state workers across the state leave early on Monday.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring. \"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nOther cities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Mo., and Lincoln, Neb.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph, according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph, created by the same system that has raised the risk of severe weather on the Plains, have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico that is fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the U.S. National Weather Service's Denver area office.\n\nThe moisture is not being pulled into Colorado though which is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nSevere weather was possible in southern Kansas after about 4 p.m. Monday. The dangerous weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Powerful storms have erupted in the central United States, bringing tornadoes to rural Oklahoma and large hail in parts of Kansas, with forecasters warning that the dangerous weather could stretch into the early hours of Tuesday amid a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states.\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service said Monday.\n\nGusty winds and heavy rains began Monday afternoon, while tornadoes were spotted after dark skirting northern Oklahoma, including one that touched down about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa. At one point, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe Weather Service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Forecasters warn that the storms could stretch late into the night as portions of the three states were under a tornado watch.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, and at least one tornado was spotted in Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe town's mayor, Johnny Kelley, said one person died and one man was missing. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Osage County Undersheriff Gary Upton said by telephone.\n\n\"It is a small town and it just pretty much went right through the center of it,\" he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one person who was still missing, Kelley said.

The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph).\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain.

At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Osage County Undersheriff Gary Upton said by telephone.\n\n\"It is a small town and it just pretty much went right through the center of it,\" he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Severe storms battered parts of the Midwest on Tuesday, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes in the region one day after a deadly twister ripped through a small Oklahoma town and killed at least one person.\n\nTornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in southwestern Michigan, northern Indiana and northwestern Ohio. Forecasters warn that the storms could stretch late into the night as portions of the three states were under a tornado watch.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, and at least one tornado was spotted in Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe town's mayor, Johnny Kelley, said one person died and one man was missing. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.

The Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office said there were \"multiple trees down and wires throughout\" Portage and nearby Pavilion Township. A Portage city spokesperson said in a statement that there was significant damage to homes and businesses, but no immediate reports of serious injuries.\n\nPhotos posted to social media showed major damage to a FedEx building in the Portage area.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, a FedEx spokesperson confirmed its facility was damaged, but said there were \"no serious injuries.\"\n\n\"We continue to assess the damage, and we are implementing contingency plans to lessen any potential impacts on service,\" the statement read.\n\nPortage Director of Public Safety Nicholas Armold told CBS News all FedEx employees were accounted for and none had been trapped beneath the wreckage of the building.\n\nMore than 20,000 people lost power in the Portage area, Consumers Energy said Tuesday night. The company estimated most would be without power until 10 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch, and Cass counties on Tuesday night after the storm brought \"large hail up to four inches in diameter and at least two confirmed tornadoes,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in Bartlesville, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas including Sulphur and Holdenville were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state capital of Oklahoma City, was still activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather got dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas were under a high-risk weather warning on Monday. Bill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said such a warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph were blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds were being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that was also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado wasn't at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So far it sounds like most everyone there is okay from what we've heard initially.\"\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in Bartlesville, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers and residents surveyed the damage in one Barnsdall neighborhood as lightning flashed and heavy rain came down, local TV news footage showed. The tornado had ripped off the roof one house before spitting it back out onto the street.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nCBS Tulsa affiliate KOTV cited Osage County Emergency Management as saying there were confirmed reports of numerous injuries and widespread damage in Barnsdall. OCEM said many people were believed to be trapped in their homes and that downed power lines and concern about possible gas leaks were making it difficult to respond. County officials are working to clear the roads.\n\nSearch and rescue efforts were underway at Osage Nation Reservation, authorities said.\n\nSome 17,000 homes and businesses were in the dark in Oklahoma as of 5:45 a.m. local time.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned earlier in the evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph. Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas including Sulphur and Holdenville were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state capital of Oklahoma City, was still activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe weather service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat of tornadoes Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather got dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas were under a high-risk weather warning on Monday.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said such a warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph were blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds were being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that was also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado wasnlt at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score":

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "By Alexa St. John, Sean Murphy And Jim Salter The Associated Press\n\nStorm chasers spotted a tornado on the ground Monday in rural Oklahoma while large hail pelted parts of Kansas as forecasters issued a rare high risk warning for the two states with the possibility of long-track twisters.\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe storm chasers detected several small funnels emerging from clouds before identifying a twister near the small 1,000-person Oklahoma town of Okeene. No damage was immediately reported, but the National Weather Service warned those in the area to take shelter.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nIn all, nearly 10 million people live in areas that could be affected, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nTucker said there's not much you can do to protect cattle from severe storms, but he said the animals tend to know when the weather turns threatening.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nCities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe expected thunderstorms could produce winds up to and potentially exceeding 80 mph (49.71 kph), according to Porter. Even worse, those \"supercell\" storms can produce destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. \"The risk for tornadoes tonight will continue into the evening and overnight hours making it very challenging.\"\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nBunting advises people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he said. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that heavy rain fell over southeastern Texas, not southwestern Texas.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan. Murphy reported from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Salter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area, while photos posted on Facebook showed severe roof damage at a FedEx building and debris resting on delivery vehicles. It wasn't immediately known if there were injuries.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA tornado watch was also issued Tuesday afternoon for portions of northeast Indiana and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat as those Monday had, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nA deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe weather had soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But it was after dark when tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Several Midwest states were bracing for dangerous storms Tuesday as tornadoes spun through parts of Michigan, one day after a powerful twister roared through a small Oklahoma town, killing at least one person and destroying dozens of homes.\n\nThe National Weather Service said some tornadoes were spotted in southwestern Michigan on Tuesday, including two that blitzed parts of Portage, a city just south of Kalamazoo. The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area, while photos posted on Facebook showed severe roof damage at a FedEx building and debris resting on delivery vehicles. It wasn't immediately known if there were injuries.\n\nA tornado watch was also issued Tuesday afternoon for portions of northeast Indiana and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nA deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town.\"\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe weather had soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But it was after dark when tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The tornado had ripped off the roof of one house before spitting it back out onto the street. Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOTV that there were no confirmed fatalities as of 11 p.m. local time.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned earlier in the evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe Weather Service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas were under a high-risk weather warning on Monday.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said such a warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

The tornado had ripped off the roof of one house before spitting it back out onto the street. Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOTV that there were no confirmed fatalities as of 11 p.m. local time.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned earlier in the evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe Weather Service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas were under a high-risk weather warning on Monday.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said such a warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Tuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States, ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one man who was still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the damage on Tuesday, said the tornado was rated by weather researchers as an EF4, which is described as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient, and we're going to rebuild,\" Stitt said.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power. ... That's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nThe weather soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Osage County Undersheriff Gary Upton said by telephone.\n\n\"It is a small town and it just pretty much went right through the center of it,\" he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The city said in a news release that no serious injuries had been reported despite the twisters severely damaging homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Here's what the law and officials say\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the facility at one point because of downed power lines, authorities said. But FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in a nearby mobile home park.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\n\"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community,\" Kelley said. \"I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. It later posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries, and they were being taken to other facilities.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, who was staying at the hotel, said he was ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the comments from the FedEx spokesperson were made late Tuesday, not Monday.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Weather forecasters warned residents in several Midwest states on Tuesday to brace for dangerous storms, one day after a powerful twister roared through a small Oklahoma town, killing at least one person and destroying dozens of homes.\n\nA tornado watch was issued Tuesday afternoon for portions of northeast Indiana, southern Michigan and northwest Ohio with the possibility of tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour. Tuesday's storms were not expected to pose as intense a threat, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States, ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee. The powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage.\n\nOne person died in the town and one man is missing, Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said.\n\n\"There are several homes destroyed, completely leveled,\" he said. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is this is a small community. I know 75% to 80% of the people in this town.\"\n\nFirst responders rescued about 25 people, including children, from heavily damaged homes where buildings had collapsed on or around them, Kelley said. About a half dozen people suffered injuries, including a firefighter who was taken to a hospital with chest pains, he said.\n\nAuthorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning to find one man who was still missing, Kelley said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nAerial videos from Barnsdall showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage, Kelley said.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the damage on Tuesday, said the tornado was rated by weather researchers as an EF4, which is described as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient, and we're going to rebuild,\" Stitt said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris was scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with smashed-out windows.\n\nMatthew Macedo, 30, who was staying at the hotel, said he rushed with his coworker to the hotel lobby after hearing the tornado sirens and was then ushered into the hotel laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We lost power. ... That's kind of the first indicator that things were real,\" he said. \"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden.\"\n\nThe weather soured earlier Monday, bringing gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday.

The high risk areas include parts of Kansas and much of Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, which are still recovering from last month's tornado. The bad weather left four dead and thousands without electricity at the time.\n\nAs rare \"high risk\" has been issued for central Oklahoma and southern Kansas, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center notes that nearly 10 million people reside in the areas under threat of severe weather conditions. Following the alert, public schools in Oklahoma and other metro-area districts cancelled all after-school events.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" said Bill Bunting, Storm Prediction Center's deputy director. Bunting warned that such an alert is not something that is \"seen every day or every spring,\" per Associated Press. Other cities that are likely to face severe weather conditions include Kansas City, Missouri and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe outlet adds that Oklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated following last weekend's deadly storms. The state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most state workers across the state leave early on Monday.\n\nMarch 31, 2023, was the last time a \"high risk\" was issued. At the time, a massive storm devoured parts of the South and Midwest, including Arkansas, Illinois, and rural Indiana. AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter notes that Monday's tornado watch and severe alert weather is the \"worst in five years.\"\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said, adding that the thunderstorms could produce winds exceeding 80 mph. Such \"supercell\" storms often result in destructive tornadoes.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said, adding, \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType":

Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBefore Monday night's powerful tornado touched down, the National Weather Service had warned that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" north of Tulsa was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live.

Forecasts warn more is to come. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Gusty winds and heavy rains began Monday afternoon, while tornadoes were spotted after dark skirting northern Oklahoma, including one that touched down about a 45-minute drive north of Tulsa. At one point, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe Weather Service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak that could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being transported to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east into on Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.

Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being transported to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east into on Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBefore Monday night's powerful tornado touched down, the National Weather Service had warned that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" north of Tulsa was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live.

Forecasters there issued a rare high risk for central Oklahoma and southern Kansas.\n\nOther cities that could see stormy weather include Kansas City, Missouri, as well as Lincoln, Nebraska, the NWS map for Monday shows.\n\n\"The potential for tornadoes will INCREASE after dark, so do not let your guard down,\" the post continued, adding that the chance of tornado formation becomes \"favorable after dark.\"\n\nIn \"many locations\" one \"won't see a storm, but if you do, it will be bad ... please check the weather before you get in your vehicle this afternoon to leave work or school. If there are storms nearby, consider delaying your trip!\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring. \"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nMr. Bunting then people in the affected areas to develop a severe weather plan early in the day.\n\n\"Make sure that you have ways to communicate with your family members,\" he stated. \"Make sure everyone knows where their shelters are,\" and how they can continue to receive warnings.\n\nMeanwhile, early Monday heavy rains hit southwestern Texas, especially the Houston area, leaving neighborhoods flooded and leading to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis, and Cincinnati, where tens of millions of people live.\n\n\"A volatile setup from severe thunderstorms has become more apparent from northeast Texas into the Mid-South/mid MS Valley and parts of the OH Valley, where and Enhanced Risk has been introduced,\" the NWS said for Wednesday's outlook.\n\nIt added: \"Current expectations are for severe convection to erupt fairly early in the day, perhaps by late Wednesday morning, along both the cold front and warm front as ascent with the shortwave trough overspreads the rapidly destabilizing warm sector.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak that could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being transported to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east into on Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

(Ronald W. Erdrich/The Abilene Reporter-News via AP)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A tornado destroyed homes, forced the evacuation of a nursing home and toppled trees and power lines when it roared through a small Oklahoma town, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States amid a series of powerful storms that stretched into today. At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through earlier today in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Osage County Undersheriff Gary Upton said by telephone.\n\n\"It is a small town and it just pretty much went right through the center of it,\" he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nA survey team planned to head out today to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley today with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east today, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph. Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "vindy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vindicator"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki",

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nThe Pavilion Estates Mobile Home Park in southeast Kalamazoo was \"hit hard\" by a tornado and entire homes at the park were destroyed, officials said. Rescue crews were on-site searching for survivors and those in need of temporary shelter, which was set up at Portage Senior Center, NBC News reports.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov.

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town.

Portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters.

The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town.

Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBefore Monday night's powerful tornado touched down, the National Weather Service had warned that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" north of Tulsa was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited 17 reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, two each in Kansas, South Dakota and Iowa, and one each in Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nOne person died in Barnsdall and at least one is missing, Osage County Undersheriff Gary Upton said by telephone.\n\n\"It is a small town and it just pretty much went right through the center of it,\" he said.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being taken to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nA survey team planned to head out Tuesday to evaluate damage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville, and in Arkansas, according to Joe Sellers, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe storm prediction center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@triblive.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

The National Weather Service office there issued a tornado emergency alert Monday night for the nearby towns of Bartlesville, Dewey and Barnsdall.\n\nThe Weather Service warned \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward those towns, with wind gusts up to 70 mph.\n\nOther tornadoes had been spotted earlier in the evening near the 1,000-person town of Okeene, while another storm in Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour.\"\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, faced the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nThe high risk was due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph had been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds were being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that also pulled up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Colleen Slevin, Heather Hollingsworth and Rio Yamat of The Associated Press.\n\nClouds amass over power lines follow days of storms on Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Humble, Texas.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nREAD MORE: Hundreds rescued from Texas floods as more storms move through Houston area\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBefore Monday night's powerful tornado touched down, the National Weather Service had warned that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" north of Tulsa was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries.

Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east into on Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said.

Forecasts warn more is to come", "body": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes touched down Monday evening in rural Oklahoma and large hail pelted parts of Kansas as an outbreak of dangerous storms brought the possibility of strong twisters staying on the ground for many miles.\n\nForecasters have issued a rare high-risk weather warning for the two states.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes have been spotted in north central Oklahoma, including near the small 1,000-person town of Okeene, while a storm in the nearby town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour.\"\n\n\"You can't rely on waiting to see tornadoes before sheltering tonight,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe greatest risk of damaging weather includes areas in Oklahoma, such as Sulphur and Holdenville, still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nA dispatcher for Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, said there was a report of tornado damage to a single home, but it wasn't immediately known if anyone was in the home or if anyone was hurt. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nMeanwhile, apple-sized hail of 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in diameter was reported near Ellinwood, Kansas, a town of about 2,000 residents 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.\n\nThe Weather Service said that more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat for tornadoes.\n\nSchools and colleges across the state, including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City Public Schools and several metro-area school districts, shut down early and canceled late afternoon and evening classes and activities.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms, and the state's commissioner of public safety told state agencies to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the far western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail and letting his neighbors know they can come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said a high risk from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign. And it's a day to take very, very seriously,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe last time a high risk was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe risk on Monday in parts of the southern Plains is the worst in five years, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\n\"If you look at a meteorology textbook about how to get a significant tornado outbreak in the southern Plains, all the ingredients you need are here today,\" Porter said.\n\nThe number of storms and their intensity should increase quickly in the evening hours across western parts of Oklahoma and up into south-central Kansas, Bunting said.\n\n\"The kinds of tornadoes that this storm can produce are particularly intense, and they can be long-lasting,\" Porter said. \"These are the tornadoes that sometimes can last for 45 minutes or an hour, even more, creating paths of destruction as they move along.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe high risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph (46.60 kph) have been blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds are being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that is also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, said Greg Heavener, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado is not at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms, he said.\n\nThe dangerous Plains weather will move east, potentially creating overnight risk in places like Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri through early Tuesday, Porter said.\n\n\"This is not going to be a atmospheric setup where the sun is going to go down and the thunderstorms are going to wane and there's going to be no additional risk,\" noted Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that heavy rain fell over southeastern Texas, not southwestern Texas.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit, Michigan, and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri. Associated Press writers Rio Yamat in Las Vegas, Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas, and Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press

Portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBefore Monday night's powerful tornado touched down, the National Weather Service had warned that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" north of Tulsa was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live.

He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said.\n\nHe said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest, including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wgntv.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.", "source": {"uri": "recordherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record Herald"}, "authors": [],

The sheriff's office there said multiple trees and power lines were down in the area. A FedEx building was destroyed, debris left resting on delivery vehicles, but a company spokesperson said there were no serious injuries despite the severe damage.\n\nAn estimated 50 people were trapped inside the facility at one point because of downed power lines, authorities said. But FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, entire homes were destroyed in a nearby mobile home park.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center has cited more than a dozen reports of tornadoes from Monday evening through early Tuesday in the central part of the United States. Eight of the twisters were in Oklahoma, while Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Tennessee all saw at least one tornado.\n\nThe deadly tornado that touched down Monday night in Oklahoma ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service there had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley said one person was dead while one man was missing after Monday's twister. Authorities launched a secondary search Tuesday morning for the missing man.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.\n\nAerial videos showed several well-built homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off and damaged walls still standing. The powerful twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with wind speeds up to 200 mph. Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield and Ed White of The Assocaited Press.\n\nDebris and damage from powerful storms are pictured, Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in Barnsdall, Okla.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak that could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being transported to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east into on Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri. Associated Press writers Rio Yamat in Las Vegas, Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas, Colleen Slevin in Denver, Kathy McCormack in Concord, New Hampshire, and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

The nearby city of Bartlesville also took a \"direct hit\" from a funnel, according to Washington County Emergency Director Kary Cox.\n\nStephen Nehrenz, a meteorologist at CBS Tulsa affiliate KOTV, said on social media late Monday that, \"The Hampton Inn in Bartlesville took a hit from tonight's tornado. Reports are they lost most of the building's roof. So far it sounds like most everyone there is okay from what we've heard initially.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers and residents surveyed the damage in one Barnsdall neighborhood as lightning flashed and heavy rain came down, local TV news footage showed. The tornado had ripped off the roof one house before spitting it back out onto the street. Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOTV there were no confirmed fatalities as of 11 p.m. local time.\n\nThe station said cited Osage County Emergency Management as saying there were confirmed reports of numerous injuries and widespread damage. OCEM said many people were believed to be trapped in their homes and that downed power lines and concern about possible gas leaks were making it difficult to respond. County officials are working to clear the roads.\n\nSearch and rescue efforts were underway at Osage Nation Reservation, authorities said.\n\nSome 28,000 homes and businesses were in the dark in Oklahoma as of 3:30 a.m. local time.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned earlier in the evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph. Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas including Sulphur and Holdenville were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state capital of Oklahoma City, was still activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nThe weather service said more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far northern Texas, faced the most severe threat of tornadoes Monday.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect them from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather got dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas were under a high-risk weather warning on Monday.\n\nBill Bunting, deputy director of the Storm Prediction Center, said such a warning from the center is not something seen every day or every spring.\n\n\"It's the highest level of threat we can assign,\" he said.\n\nThe last time it was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe increased risk is due to an unusual confluence: Winds gusting up to around 75 mph were blasting through Colorado's populated Front Range region, including the Denver area, on Monday.\n\nThe winds were being created by a low pressure system north of Colorado that was also pulling up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, fueling the risk of severe weather on the Plains, according to the National Weather Service's Denver-area office.\n\nColorado wasnlt at risk of tornadoes or thunderstorms.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score":

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak that could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being transported to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east into on Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters.

Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Multiple injuries were reported at the park.\n\nBy ED WHITE, ALEXA ST. JOHN and SEAN MURPHY - Associated Press\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday, a day after two reported tornadoes struck one Michigan city and destroyed homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

JOHN, SEAN MURPHY and JIM SALTERMay 7, 2024 at 12:19 PM\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A tornado destroyed homes and toppled trees and power lines when it roared through a small Oklahoma town, one of several twisters that erupted in the central United States amid a series of powerful storms that stretched into Tuesday. At least one death was was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nBy ED WHITE, ALEXA ST.

JOHN and SEAN MURPHY - Associated Press\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms barreled through the Midwest, unleashing a curtain of heavy rain, gusty winds and tornadoes throughout the region that forecasters warned could stretch into Wednesday morning.\n\nTornadoes were spotted after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. Portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBefore Monday night's powerful tornado touched down, the National Weather Service had warned that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" north of Tulsa was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Severe thunderstorms also swept through Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Joplin, Mo., Kansas City and Des Moines on Monday night.\n\nMonday marked the first of four days in the which the Weather Service predicts an elevated threat of dangerous storms that could produce tornadoes as well as large hail and damaging winds. Tuesday's highest storm threat is in the Ohio Valley, including Indianapolis and Cincinnati, while Wednesday's in the Mid-South and Tennessee Valley, including Nashville and Louisville. On Thursday, scattered severe storms could affect the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\n\nThe storms come after at least 300 tornadoes were recorded in April, the second-most in a month on record. Monday marked the 12th straight day with at least one tornado in the United States.\n\nDamage in Barnsdall and Bartlesville\n\nAs daylight broke Tuesday, scenes from social media revealed scenes of devastation in Barnsdall. Many homes and businesses were flattened, trees were mangled and defoliated and vehicles flipped and crushed. One video showed a door lodged in a tree.\n\nRadar indicated the twister hurled debris up to 30,000 feet into the air and estimated winds could have reached 170 to 190 mph. Video showed the twister's large, ominous wedgelike funnel.\n\nJerry Roberts, the emergency management director in Osage County, said Barnsdall was \"still in rescue mode\" early Tuesday.\n\nFirefighters and police officers are \"going through the neighborhood trying to locate any trapped persons,\" he said in a phone call. \"There's been several that went to the hospital.\"\n\nRoberts added the twister appeared \"to be somewhere in the neighborhood of over a half-mile wide, but we don't know how long it is yet.\" The Weather Service will survey the storm damage Tuesday and determine the tornado's exact size and intensity.\n\nThe Weather Service declared a tornado emergency, its highest alert, when the tornado swept through Barnsdall.\n\n\"TORNADO EMERGENCY for Barnsdall,\" the Weather Service wrote as the \"confirmed large and destructive\" storm passed. \"This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. TAKE COVER NOW!\"\n\nThe Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported 30 to 40 homes damaged in the Barnsdall area, according to an update provided by the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management at 1 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe department said that a natural gas leak was reported in the city, while \"numerous roads are closed due to debris in roadways.\"\n\nA nursing home was among the buildings hit in Barnsdall.\n\n\"Please pray for us,\" Barnsdall Nursing Home, a 38-bed facility in the town's southwest, wrote on social media, saying all residents were accounted for with no injuries or deaths. They had been temporarily relocated to a football field because of a gas leak that couldn't be fixed and would be moved to other facilities.\n\nThe nursing home asked families to be patient \"as it is chaos in town.\"\n\nTrees and power lines were reportedly downed in other counties, and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission was reporting 45,227 outages statewide by 12:30 a.m., according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management.\n\nFor Barnsdall, it was the second tornado to hit in just over a month. On April 1, an EF1 tornado on the 0-to-5 scale for intensity caused damage in the city.\n\nAfter passing Barnsdall, the storm reached Bartlesville, a city of nearly 40,000 about 15 miles to the northeast, about 30 minutes later. The city was also placed under a tornado emergency, and the twister appeared to weaken as it was passing or just afterward.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado here in Bartlesville,\" Kary Cox, the director of operations at Washington County Emergency Management, said in a video update. He urged residents to stay home overnight, saying traffic was hampering emergency efforts. Social media video showed a Hampton Inn heavily damaged by the twister; in one instance, a hotel wall was speared by a two-by-four piece of wood.\n\nThe same storm system that affected the central states Monday is moving to the northeast into the Great Lakes, with a trailing cold front extending south toward Texas, along which storms will form as warm air oozes north to the east from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nLouisville, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Columbus have a Level 3 out of 5 Enhanced risk for severe weather, including the potential for a couple of significant tornadoes. A broader Level 2 risk surrounds that zone from Chicago to Bowling Green, Ky., where a couple tornadoes are still possible.\n\nWednesday's severe risk\n\nOn Wednesday, a new low pressure system will take shape in Oklahoma and drift northeast toward St. Louis. Warmth and humidity will again surge north. Changing winds with height, meanwhile, will support the potential for tornadoes, particularly where a warm front stretches west to east from Springfield, Mo., to Nashville. That's where a Level 3 risk has been outlined.\n\nA Level 2 risk stretches from Dallas to Little Rock to Louisville, and clips Memphis and Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\nThursday's severe risk\n\nOn Thursday, the low pressure system will swing the cold front toward both the Gulf and East Coasts. As that front sags southeastward, it will clash with warm, humid air. Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible, with the main threat being damaging straight-line winds and hail.\n\nAn enormous stretch of real estate is covered by a Level 2 risk including Austin; Shreveport, La.; Jackson, Miss.; Mobile, Ala.; Atlanta; Charleston, N.C.; Charlotte; Wilmington, N.C.; Richmond; Washington and Baltimore.\n\nWhy were Monday's tornadoes less numerous and intense than feared?\n\nDespite the destructive tornado in Barnsdall and the several tornadoes reported elsewhere, the event as a whole did not live up to dire forecasts made by government, broadcast and independent meteorologists alike.\n\nWhile the ingredients were conducive to the formation of numerous strong, long-track tornadoes, it appears the Barnsdall storm was the only cell to take advantage of them. Otherwise, the ingredients didn't combine as forecast - and meteorologists are working to understand why.\n\nA few factors contributed to reduced tornado activity:\n\n-Low-level winds didn't take on enough of an easterly component. That means that, despite rotation within storms, many cells struggled to consolidate that rotation near the ground, reducing the tornado risk.\n\n-The storm structure did not evolve to support widespread tornado activity. \"We expect storms to become supercells quickly after they form, and they should remain supercells through the event,\" wrote the National Weather Service in Norman before storms fired. \"We do not expect them to form into a squall line or cluster.\" But that's exactly what happened - by 8 to 9 p.m., initial supercells had largely merged into a lengthy cluster, which did not promote rotation within storms. The Barnsdall tornado was able to occur because it was a lone, discrete supercell ahead of the line.\n\n-It appears that temperatures did not fall quickly enough at the mid levels of the atmosphere. That slowed down the speed of thunderstorm updrafts. That was further exacerbated by a \"lid\" of warm air high aloft.

A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nD-FW Weather Wise\n\nFrom snow to 100-degree heat, we've got you covered.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways.

Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said.

Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live.

A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma.

He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri. Associated Press writers Rio Yamat in Las Vegas, Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas, and Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "abc7chicago.com", "dataType":

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield and Beatrice Dupuy.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [],

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph. Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type":

A tornado emergency was issued for Union City -- marking the first tornado emergency for the state on record, going back to 1999.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned there was a \"confirmed large and destructive tornado\" over Union City at 6:11 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n\nAfter more than a dozen tornadoes were reported in the Plains overnight into Tuesday, the tornado threat moved into Ohio Valley and parts of the southern Great Lakes Tuesday afternoon and evening. Some 35 million Americans are in the storm zone, from Chicago to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nA tornado watch was issued for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky into Tuesday night. A few tornadoes, damaging gusts up to 70 mph and baseball-sized hail are likely.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear urged residents to prepare for the severe weather -- including \"potentially significant tornadoes,\" flooding, hail and high winds -- expected to hit much of the state over the next few days.\n\n\"We have been through all of those and we have seen how deadly they can be,\" Beshear said during a press briefing Tuesday. \"So we need everyone to take action now by making a plan to keep yourself and your family safe.\"\n\nThe latest tornado threat comes as at least 20 tornadoes were reported in seven states overnight into Tuesday.\n\nThe twisters were reported in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee.\n\nOne of the hardest-hit areas in the storm was Barnsdall and Bartlesville, Oklahoma, north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service in Tulsa found low-end EF4 damage near Barnsdall during the tornado survey process on Tuesday.\n\nOne person was killed and several injured in Barnsdall, which sustained \"significant damage\" due to the tornado, according to Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley.\n\n\"We need a lot of prayers,\" Kelley told reporters during a press briefing following the tornado.\n\nSome 60 to 70 homes in the small town were \"totally destroyed,\" among approximately 350 destroyed statewide, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said.\n\nApproximately 25 people were rescued following an initial search, Kelley said. One person remains unaccounted for as another search effort got underway Tuesday, he said.\n\nThe missing man was in his trailer home talking to his son on the phone just minutes before the tornado came through, according to Stitt. Police K-9 units are involved in the search, he said.\n\n\"We're just praying a miracle happens,\" Stitt told reporters during a press briefing Tuesday evening.\n\nStitt has declared a state of emergency for several counties in the state due to the severe weather.\n\nThe destructive tornado was the second to hit Barnsdall in recent weeks.\n\n\"It's a devastating blow to the people in the community,\" Kelley said. \"It's going to be life-changing.\"\n\nNOAA's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, had issued the highest-possible severe weather risk alert for multiple intense, long-track tornadoes Monday afternoon and evening.", "source": {"uri": "abc7ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Brad Devereaux/Kalamazoo Gazette via AP)\n\nSevere storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday, a day after two tornadoes struck one Michigan city and destroyed homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nThe tornadoes were first spotted after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night.\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and the state Department of Health reported a nursing home was damaged and patients were being evacuated. A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways.

Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said.

Photos on social media have shown some damage to buildings.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings for southern parts of Michigan. \"Severe storms are still tracking between Kalamazoo and Jackson. Tornadoes and large hail are the main threats,\" the National Weather Service Grand Rapids said.\n\n\"Stay home\" and \"Please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock,\" the city of Portage pleaded with its residents.\n\nSeveral tornado warnings are also in effect from western Ohio to eastern Indiana.\n\nThe severe weather came a day after destructive storms roared through the Plains Monday, unloading at least one deadly tornado, giant hail and hurricane-force wind gusts. As some communities pick up the pieces, others had been preparing Tuesday for the threat of strong twisters in the Midwest.\n\n* One killed, several injured Monday: At least one person is dead and several others are injured after a tornado tore through Oklahoma's Osage and Washington counties Monday night, Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden said in an on-air interview with CNN affiliate KOKI. Extensive damage occurred to dozens of homes between Barnsdall and Bartlesville. A search was ongoing in Barnsdall Tuesday for \"one or two\" people still unaccounted for, the town's mayor Johnny Kelley said at a news conference.\n\n* Tornado damage in at least two other states: A tornado caused \"considerable damage\" in Sullivan, Missouri, late Monday night according to storm reports. The extent of the damage is unclear, but images from the scene showed buildings filleted by the twister. Another tornado tore through parts of DeKalb County, Tennessee, and damaged at least a dozen homes in the Smithville area early Monday afternoon, officials told CNN.\n\n* More than 200 storm reports: There were 244 storm reports Monday, including 17 tornado reports, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Hail the size of softballs slammed down in Kansas while baseball-sized hail pummeled Oklahoma. Wind gusts of 70 mph or greater were recorded in Nebraska and Kansas while an 82-mph wind gust occurred near Chester, Oklahoma.\n\n* Rare high risk issued: Monday marked the first high - Level 5 of 5 - risk issued for the US by the Storm Prediction Center in more than a year. It was the first time in nearly five years Oklahoma was under such an extreme risk and the first time in nearly seven years in Kansas.\n\n* More storms to come: Level 3 of 5 risks for severe thunderstorms are in place for parts of the US on Tuesday and Wednesday, with millions at risk of damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes.\n\nTown hit by tornado for the second time in five weeks\n\nMonday night's triggered a tornado emergency for Barnsdall, Oklahoma, but residents here were all too familiar with the situation. It was the second damaging tornado in just over a month to hit the town, which was struck by an EF1 on April 1.\n\nUnder the cover of darkness Monday night, the large and destructive tornado barreled through the town.\n\nDorothy Aultz and her son Carl Kelley were at Dorothy's Barnsdall home when the tornado hit. Dorothy is elderly and receiving hospice care, Carl told CNN, so he went to his mother's home to protect her during the storm.\n\nWith a tornado on the way and no basement to shelter in, Carl had to improvise. He placed blankets on the bathroom floor, placed Dorothy on them and laid on top of her to protect her from debris.\n\nThe tornado tore through the home and destroyed most of it, but the bathroom held strong. Both mother and son made through the experience unscathed and were rescued from the rubble.\n\nThey were among the roughly two dozen people rescued from their damaged or destroyed homes Monday night, Kelley, the city's mayor, said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nThe full extent of the tornado's destruction in Barnsdall didn't become clear until the sun rose Tuesday. Much of the town has \"significant damage;\" a nursing home was damaged and evacuated; and several homes were \"completely leveled,\" Kelley said.\n\nBut it's the loss of a man Kelley knew well in this close-knit community of 1,400 that will stick with him, he said.\n\n\"To me, the material things are material, you can replace them,\" Kelley said. \"The loss of life, it's something that's forever.\"\n\nTornado threat shifts to Midwest, Tennessee Valley Tuesday\n\nStrong storms shifted east on Tuesday and have ushered in a renewed threat of damaging wind gusts, large hail and tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorms got underway Tuesday afternoon in parts of Illinois but will expand across much of the Midwest and Tennessee Valley through the evening.\n\nNearly 13 million people here are at risk of a few strong tornadoes of at least EF2 strength. The Level 3 of 5 risk area includes large portions of Indiana, including Indianapolis; Kentucky, including Louisville; and Ohio, including Columbus.\n\nDamaging winds and hail are possible outside of the highest risk area across a huge portion of the eastern US.\n\nMillions are at risk of damaging storms once again on Wednesday, including areas hard-hit by Monday's storms.\n\nAn expansive Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from northeastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma to much of Kentucky and Tennessee. Damaging wind gusts, hail bigger than baseballs and tornadoes are all possible within Wednesday's storms.\n\nSome strong tornadoes are possible, mainly from Missouri through central Kentucky and northern Tennessee. St. Louis and Nashville are just two cities at risk of powerful tornadoes.\n\nTorrential rainfall may also occur within any storm Wednesday and trigger flash flooding. A Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place for a large portion of the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Rainfall rates could approach 1 to 2 inches per hour in the heaviest storms.\n\nCNN's Joe Sutton, Lucy Kafanov, Robert Shackelford and Andi Babineau contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news

The watch will stay in effect until 8:00 p.m. CDT.\n\nOverall, much of the central and eastern United States remains at risk for severe thunderstorms Tuesday from Texas to Wyoming and as far east as Pennsylvania and the Carolinas, according to the Weather Prediction Center. More than 13 million people in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky were at \"enhanced risk\" of seeing storms capable of unleashing \"very large hail\" and strong tornadoes.\n\nScattered supercell thunderstorms were forecast to spread across southern and eastern Indiana into western Ohio into late Tuesday. Supercells are the least common type of thunderstorm and tend to produce severe weather, including damaging winds, large hail and sometimes tornadoes, according to the weather service.\n\nIn addition to Chicago and Indianapolis, other metro areas at greatest risk for severe weather on Tuesday included Cincinnati, Columbus and Louisville, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nTuesday's foul weather comes a day after strong storms battered the Plains region on Monday, spinning up multiple tornadoes that killed at least one person, destroyed buildings and knocked out power to thousands of households.\n\nThe threat of severe weather is forecast to continue across the Ohio Valley and mid-South regions on Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e At 7 p.m., more than 50,000 customers were without electricity across the region that saw storms over the previous 24 hours, to the database maintained by USA TODAY. That included nearly 31,000 customers in Michigan and roughly 7,000 each in Missouri and Oklahoma. It did not include another 45,000 customers without electricity in Colorado after winds as high as 80-90 mph on Monday.\n\n\u220e The outages had improved in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri were more than 30,000 were without power earlier Tuesday afternoon, according to the database. Of the three states, Missouri, pummeled by storms overnight, had the most outages with more than 11,000.\n\n\u220e Windy conditions and lower humidity could also pose a risk for critical fire weather across southeast Colorado, the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle region and much of New Mexico.\n\n\u220e Two school districts in northeastern Oklahoma, Bartlesville Public Schools and Barnsdall Public Schools, canceled classes on Tuesday citing power outages and road closures. Both communities were ravaged by a powerful tornado on Monday night.\n\n\u220e Oklahoma's governor, Kevin Stitt, will travel to Barnsdall Tuesday afternoon to survey the damage to the small town: \"Devastating images coming out of Barnsdall, OK, this morning,\" the governor posted on X. \"First responders spent the night executing search and rescue operations. Resources are being directed to the area to aid in recovery. I will travel to Barnsdall later this afternoon. Hold them in your prayers!\"\n\nTornadoes hit Oklahoma: 1 person dead, 7 injured, dozens of homes damaged\n\nOn Monday, at least 17 tornadoes were spotted across the Plains region, with the most damage occurring in Oklahoma where multiple people were injured and one person in Barnsdall, a small community about 40 miles north of Tulsa, was killed, KOTV reported.\n\nThe northeastern Oklahoma communities of Barnsdall and Bartlesville experienced a damaging tornado that caused injuries, with at least seven people injured in Barnsdall, CBS News Texas reported.\n\nOklahoma Highway Patrol reported around 30 to 40 homes were damaged in the Barnsdall area, which was also hit by a tornado on April 1, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. Officials also reported a natural gas leak in Barnsdall.\n\nCrews from numerous jurisdictions responded to areas throughout northeast Oklahoma to assist with medical transport, traffic control and search and rescue operations. Other counties reported flash flooding and damaged structures. Oklahoma was hit with tornadoes just last week that devastated some parts of the state, leaving at least four dead and 100 injured.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa has a crew on the ground doing damage assessments along the track of the Barnsdall tornado and expects to have a report available later Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nSlew of tornadoes slam southwest Michigan Tuesday\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency in four counties after a slew of tornadoes barreled through the southwestern part of the state and left a trail of damage in its wake.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTwo \"large and extremely dangerous\" tornadoes were confirmed in Michigan shortly after 6 p.m., the weather service said. One hit south of Kalamazoo near Portage, moving east, and the other was near Burlington, about 9 miles northwest of Coldwater moving northeast.\n\nA woman taking cover from the tornado in Portage was hit by debris as she got out of her car and her leg was broken, according to the weather service. Authorities also reported damaged and destroyed buildings.\n\nCity officials said Tuesday evening that two tornadoes were believed to have touched down in Portage, Michigan, causing severe damage to residential and commercial properties. The city said several people were displaced, multiple trees were down on roads, and there were reports of gas leaks.\n\nSt. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman confirmed multiple places across the southwest Michigan county were damaged Tuesday, the site of another confirmed tornado.\n\n\"At the moment, we are focused on life safety missions using all available resources, then we will begin preliminary damage assessments,\" Bingaman said.\n\nThe weather service also issued tornado watches for southeast Michigan counties but said the chance of tornadoes slamming that part of the state was unlikely.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has tracked 1,219 tornadoes in Michigan since 1950, killing 248 people and causing more than $1.2 billion in property damage. Eighteen twisters swept through the state in 2023 and caused two deaths, according to the NOAA.\n\nTornadoes hit other Plains states overnight\n\nSeveral states in the Plains region were hit with tornadoes including two each in Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota and one each in Missouri, Nebraska and Tennessee, according to preliminary information from the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe storms developed Monday afternoon and through the evening after the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center issued a series of dire warnings for severe weather in an area that stretched from Texas to the Dakotas.\n\nHow to be safe during a tornado warning\n\nWhile there's no such thing as guaranteed safety, the weather service says there are things people can do to increase their chances of surviving a deadly tornado.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doyle_rice@azcentral.com", "name": "Doyle Rice", "type": "author",

But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nBefore Monday night's powerful tornado touched down, the National Weather Service had warned that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" north of Tulsa was headed toward Barnsdall and the nearby town of Bartlesville.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville, several splintered 2x4s were driven into the south side of the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the hotel's lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\n\"Oklahomans are resilient,\" Stitt said, \"and we're going to rebuild.\"\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nThe powerful storms come amid a wild swing in severe weather across the globe that includes some of the worst-ever flooding in Brazil and a brutal Asian heat wave.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage and an adjacent community Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nKalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said more than a dozen mobile homes in Pavilion Township were \"totally destroyed.\" At least 16 people, he added, were injured there, though the injuries were not life-threatening.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" the sheriff said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the buzz of chainsaws and the snap of tree limbs filled the air as cleanup began at a mobile home park.\n\n\"The clean-up efforts are tremendous. ... We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day Wednesday at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nPavilion Township is adjacent to Portage and about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy.

A tornado destroyed homes, forced the evacuation of a nursing home and toppled trees and power lines when it roared through the small Oklahoma town.\n\nBy ED WHITE, ALEXA ST. JOHN and SEAN MURPHY - Associated Press\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday, a day after two tornadoes struck one Michigan city and destroyed homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nThe tornadoes were first spotted after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Severe storms moved through the Midwest on Tuesday, bringing heavy rain and strong winds a day after tornadoes in the southern Plains killed at least one person and damaged dozens of homes.\n\nSevere storms moved through the Midwest on Tuesday, bringing heavy rain and strong winds a day after tornadoes in the southern Plains killed at least one person and damaged dozens of homes.\n\nAbout 13.5 million people in parts of Indiana, northern Kentucky and western Ohio were warned about an enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms through Tuesday evening, with the possibility of strong tornadoes and large hail, according to the Storm Prediction Center of the National Weather Service.\n\nThe roughly 60,000-square-mile area could also experience frequent lightning and strong wind gusts, according to the Weather Service.\n\nAs storms moved through the region Tuesday afternoon, the Weather Service issued a string of tornado warnings in cities across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.\n\nA larger section of the Midwest, encompassing nearly 16 million people across portions of Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, was facing a slight risk of severe weather Tuesday.\n\nAaron Updike, a meteorologist for the service in Indianapolis, one of the cities under an enhanced risk, said severe weather would move into the region in the morning and fade away shortly thereafter.\n\n\"We're going to get some redevelopment this afternoon and evening,\" he said. \"And that is where our primary focus is.\"\n\nThe Weather Service also warned that storms passing over the region would produce heavy rain that may create some localized areas of flash flooding. Urban areas, roads, small streams and low-lying areas were most vulnerable, meteorologists said.\n\nAt least 15 tornadoes were reported to have struck parts of the Plains on Monday night. One tornado that was up to 2 miles wide ripped through Barnsdall, Oklahoma, a city about 40 miles northwest of Tulsa, killing one person, an Osage County official said.\n\nIn the predawn hours, it was difficult to assess the damage caused by the tornado, but one Osage County official said it had leveled about one-third of the small city, which has a population of about 1,000, and caused multiple injuries. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that up to 40 homes in the town had been damaged.\n\nThe tornado also lifted the roof off a nursing home in Barnsdall, though all residents were accounted for with no injuries or deaths, officials said.\n\nRescuers were going through debris Tuesday with a fine-toothed comb, said Mayor Johnny Kelley. One person was reported missing, he said.\n\n\"We are going through the debris very thoroughly,\" Kelley said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nConsidering the widespread destruction, it was \"shocking\" there were so few casualties, he said: \"The devastation is pretty substantial.\"\n\nThe tornado also caused power outages in Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. But by early Tuesday, power had been restored to all but about 10,000 customers in Oklahoma, according PowerOutage.us, which aggregates utilities information across the U.S.\n\nIn Bartlesville, Oklahoma, about 45 miles north of Tulsa, city officials said that emergency responders had rescued a number of trapped people at a Hampton Inn and were recovering downed power lines early Tuesday. They said minor injuries had been reported.\n\nRescue operations were also ongoing at the Osage Nation Reservation, where officials warned residents to stay clear of the roadways and damaged areas.",

King said she took cover in the home's cellar while her husband was at work at a nearby plant.\n\nAs the tornado came through, the cellar door blew open and began to fill with water up to her ankles. Insulation began blowing around her.\n\n\"I thought, 'Lord, that's my house.'\"\n\nThe Kings' home was just one of dozens that were damaged or destroyed in the at least EF3 deadly tornado that tore through the small city of Barnsdall in Osage County, before leaving destruction in Bartlesville to the northeast.\n\nThe devastating storm left at least one person dead in Barnsdall, and at least one person was still missing Tuesday afternoon in the city of about 1,400, according to the Osage County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe law enforcement agency requested the public's help via a social media post in locating Wayne Hogue, who they say went missing after the tornado.\n\nIt's the second time Barnsdall was affected by a tornado this year, after another tornado damaged homes on April 1.\n\n\"It's very tough,\" Mayor Johnny Kelley told reporters Tuesday. \"The toughest thing on me as the mayor is, this is a small community. I know 75 to 80% of the people in this town. The individual that we lost, I knew them very well.\"\n\nBy the time the storm reached Bartlesville, the tornado had merged with a front-line storm and was weakened. Oklahoma state Rep. Judd Strom, R-Bartlesville, told the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise that local emergency management had been preparing for an EF4 tornado to rip across the city.\n\nAt least five tornadoes have been confirmed in Oklahoma from Monday night's storms, including the Barnsdall tornado and four in the National Weather Service's Norman forecast area -- those tornadoes were in or near the towns of Helena, Okeene, Bison and Covington. Damage survey teams will determine if more are to be added to that list.\n\nMeteorologist Joe Sellers, who works with the weather service's Tulsa office, said a survey of the damage in Osage County would \"take a while.\"\n\nNatasha Coday, 39, the Kings' daughter, looked up at her parent's house in Barnsdall and pointed to where it had been forced from its foundation.\n\n\"It was right here,\" she said. \"That tornado just pushed it up and moved it over there.\"\n\nCoday was in Bartlesville during the storm and stayed on the phone with her mother as the tornado moved through Barnsdall.\n\n\"God really, really took care of them last night,\" she said. The Kings' pontoon had blown into the back of the property, a pickup had been tossed upside down and part of their camper was thrown into a tree.\n\nKing said she swore more than a month ago she'd never go back in the cellar, after getting trapped in it during the April 1 tornado that went through Barnsdall. But when the storm came through Monday night, King said she felt she \"needed to\" get back in.\n\nAmid all the destruction, a photo album of Joy and Tim King's wedding was saved.\n\nDuring an initial search Monday night after the tornado, about 25 people were rescued, including children. A secondary search took place Tuesday morning for some people still unaccounted for.\n\nSeven or eight people were injured, including one firefighter who was experiencing chest pains, Kelley said.\n\n\"We're worried about our neighbors and our friends that have lost loved ones,\" Kelley said. \"To me, material things are material. We can replace them. The loss of life is forever.\"\n\nWhen asked what the community needs at this time, Kelley answered, \"we need prayers.\"\n\nCarl Kelley, 55, rode out the storm in a closet with his mother, 80. Two mounted deer heads were lying in the yard as he tried to unlock his gun safe Tuesday morning.\n\nThe tornado shredded his house with debris thrown across the yard and in the trees. The trees were either bent or knocked over, and power lines knocked down around the property.\n\n\"I didn't think it was that bad until I looked up and didn't see the roof,\" he said.\n\nIn its wake, the tornado left several Bartlesville streets closed Tuesday due to downed power lines and fallen trees, said City Manager Mike Bailey and Washington County Emergency Management Director Kary Cox.\n\nThe storm caused significant structural damage to buildings, utilities and trees, especially in southwest Bartlesville near the Circle Mountain area and northeast sections along U.S. 75 and Tuxedo, impacting homes and businesses.\n\nDespite the extensive damage, no fatalities or serious injuries have been reported.\n\nEmergency response teams, including police, fire and street departments, were deployed after the storm struck.\n\nSeveral rescues, including guests trapped at the Hampton Inn on N U.S. 75, were successfully conducted by the combined efforts of Bartlesville, Dewey and Copan fire departments.\n\nKelley, the Barnsdall mayor, said he believes the fatality count was low thanks to his community staying \"weather aware,\" as the day was predicted to see numerous severe storms and a potential tornado outbreak.\n\n\"I attribute that to people paying attention to the weather and the warnings,\" Kelley said. \"And when the sirens were blowing and the warnings were given out over their cellphones and over their TVs, that they took cover and did what they needed to do to keep safe.\"\n\nA portion of central and northern Oklahoma was given the rare \"high\" risk categorization for severe storms and multiple strong tornadoes by the weather service's Storm Prediction Center. So far, the number of tornadoes is much lower than the outbreak of April 27 when 30 tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma.\n\nDuring that outbreak, the office of the chief medical examiner reported four storm-related fatalities: two in Holdenville while in a mobile home, one on Interstate 35 near Marietta while in a vehicle and one fatality in Sulphur in a business.\n\nThompson said while some may feel Monday's event did not live up to the risk level warned, it's all \"a matter of perception.\"\n\nContributing: Alexia Aston, The Oklahoman", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The greatest risk of bad weather can be seen in central Oklahoma and southern Kansas including areas Sulphur and Holdenville.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, more than 3.4 million people, 1,614 schools and 159 hospitals in Oklahoma, portions of southern Kansas and far north Texas, face the most severe threat of tornadoes.\n\nOklahoma braces for storm\n\nNearly 10 million individuals reside in areas potentially affected by severe weather, as indicated by the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. Schools and colleges statewide, including the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City Public Schools, closed early and cancelled afternoon and evening activities.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, active since last weekend's fatal storms, remains engaged, and the state agencies were asked by the state's commissioner of public safety to let most of their workers across Oklahoma leave early on Monday.\n\nBill Bunting, the Storm Prediction Center's deputy director, emphasised the rarity and seriousness of the high-risk designation, urging extreme caution. The last such alert was issued on March 31, 2023, coinciding with severe storms across several states. Anticipated cities under threat include Kansas City, Missouri, and Lincoln, Nebraska, with storm intensity expected to escalate rapidly, particularly in western Oklahoma and south-central Kansas, potentially spawning dangerous tornadoes.\n\nAccording to meteorologist Porter, supercell storms with winds exceeding 80 mph pose significant risks. Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor, warned that the threat would persist into the evening and overnight hours, challenging forecasting and response efforts.\n\nThe upcoming week forecasts continued storminess, with the eastern US and the South, including populous areas like Indianapolis and Memphis, likely to face severe weather, affecting over 21 million people.

A natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Power was down on Tuesday night in the area, with downed trees and wires hindering repairs, she said.\n\nPhotos showed major damage to a FedEx facility in Portage. The company's facility there sustained heavy damage, with at least 50 people inside, officials said. There were no reports of serious injuries, according to authorities.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday evening, Whitmer advised people to pay attention to the weather alerts.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those affected by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan. Emergency teams are on the ground and working to assist Michiganders. I encourage everyone to continue monitoring severe weather alerts and follow the advice of emergency officials,\" she said in a statement on X.\n\nAfter more than a dozen tornadoes were reported in the Plains overnight into Tuesday, the tornado threat moved into Ohio Valley and parts of the southern Great Lakes Tuesday afternoon and evening. Some 35 million Americans are in the storm zone, from Chicago to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nA tornado watch was issued for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky into Tuesday night. A few tornadoes, damaging gusts up to 70 mph and baseball-sized hail are likely.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear urged residents to prepare for the severe weather -- including \"potentially significant tornadoes,\" flooding, hail and high winds -- expected to hit much of the state over the next few days.\n\n\"We have been through all of those and we have seen how deadly they can be,\" Beshear said during a press briefing Tuesday. \"So we need everyone to take action now by making a plan to keep yourself and your family safe.\"\n\nThe latest tornado threat comes as at least 20 tornadoes were reported in seven states overnight into Tuesday.\n\nThe twisters were reported in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee.\n\nOne of the hardest-hit areas in the storm was Barnsdall and Bartlesville, Oklahoma, north of Tulsa. The National Weather Service in Tulsa found low-end EF4 damage near Barnsdall during the tornado survey process on Tuesday.\n\nOne person was killed and several injured in Barnsdall, which sustained \"significant damage\" due to the tornado, according to Barnsdall Mayor Johnny Kelley.\n\n\"We need a lot of prayers,\" Kelley told reporters during a press briefing following the tornado.\n\nSome 60 to 70 homes in the small town were \"totally destroyed,\" among approximately 350 destroyed statewide, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said.\n\nApproximately 25 people were rescued following an initial search, Kelley said. One person remains unaccounted for as another search effort got underway Tuesday, he said.\n\nThe missing man was in his trailer home talking to his son on the phone just minutes before the tornado came through, according to Stitt. Police K-9 units are involved in the search, he said.\n\n\"We're just praying a miracle happens,\" Stitt told reporters during a press briefing Tuesday evening.\n\nStitt has declared a state of

More than 12 million people in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky were at \"enhanced risk\" of storms capable of unleashing \"very large hail\" and strong tornadoes.\n\nMetro areas at greatest risk for severe weather on Tuesday included Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Louisville, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nTuesday's foul weather came a day after strong storms battered the Plains region on Monday, spinning up multiple tornadoes that killed at least one person, destroyed buildings and knocked out power to thousands of households.\n\nThe threat for severe weather is forecast to continue across the Ohio Valley and mid-South regions on Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e More than 30,000 people across Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri were without power Tuesday morning, according to a database maintained by USA TODAY. Of the three states, Missouri, which was pummeled by storms overnight, had the most outages with over 11,000.\n\n\u220e Windy conditions and lower humidity could also pose a risk for critical fire weather across southeast Colorado, the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle region and much of New Mexico.\n\n\u220e Two school districts in northeastern Oklahoma, Bartlesville Public Schools and Barnsdall Public Schools, canceled classes on Tuesday citing power outages and road closures. Both communities were ravaged Monday night by a powerful tornado.\n\n\u220e Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt will travel to Barnsdall Tuesday afternoon to survey the damage to the small town: \"Devastating images coming out of Barnsdall, OK, this morning,\" the governor posted on X. \"First responders spent the night executing search and rescue operations. Resources are being directed to the area to aid in recovery. I will travel to Barnsdall later this afternoon. Hold them in your prayers!\"\n\nTornadoes hit Oklahoma: 1 person dead, 7 injured, dozens of homes damaged\n\nOn Monday, at least 17 tornadoes were spotted across the Plains region, with the most damage occurring in Oklahoma where multiple people were injured and one person in Barnsdall, a small community about 40 miles north of Tulsa, was killed, KOTV reported.\n\nThe northeastern Oklahoma communities of Barnsdall and Bartlesville experienced a damaging tornado that caused injuries, with at least seven people injured in Barnsdall, CBS News Texas reported.\n\nOklahoma Highway Patrol reported around 30-40 homes were damaged in the Barnsdall area, which was also hit by a tornado on April 1, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. Officials also reported a natural gas leak in Barnsdall.\n\nCrews from the numerous jurisdictions responded to areas throughout northeast Oklahoma to assist with medical transport, traffic control and search and rescue operations. Other counties reported flash flooding and damaged structures. Oklahoma just last week was hit with tornadoes that devastated some parts of the state, leaving at least four dead and 100 injured.\n\nTornadoes hit other Plains states overnight\n\nSeveral states in the Plains region were hit with tornadoes including two each in Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota and one each in Missouri, Nebraska and Tennessee, according to preliminary information from the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe storms developed Monday afternoon and through the evening after the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center issued a series of dire warnings for severe weather in an area that stretched from Texas to the Dakotas.\n\nHow to be safe during a tornado warning\n\nWhile there's no such thing as guaranteed safety, the weather service says there are things people can do to increase their chances of surviving a deadly tornado.\n\nProtect yourself from flying or falling debris, the single biggest life-threatening hazard.\n\nSeek shelter in the closest, safest interior or underground room.\n\nAlways avoid windows. Don't go to the windows or doors to look outside.\n\nCover yourself with thick protective coverings, such as a mattress, sleeping bags and thick blankets or other protective coverings.\n\nWear a helmet if you have one to protect your head from debris.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Jana Hayes, Dale Denwalt and

At least one death was reported.\n\nThe tornado ripped through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, about a 40-minute drive north of Tulsa, on Monday night. It was the second tornado to hit the town in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles in Barnsdall.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nAt least 30 to 40 homes in the Barnsdall area were damaged Monday night, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported, and a nursing home said it evacuated residents because a gas leak that could not be turned off due to storm damage. Numerous road closings due to debris also were reported, according to Osage County Emergency Management.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We've got one confirmed fatality and multiple injuries,\" Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden told KOKI-TV.\n\nThe Barnsdall Nursing Home posted online that all residents were accounted for with no injuries. They were being transported to other facilities. It asked families to bear with them \"as it is chaos in town ... Please pray for us.\"\n\nDamage also was reported in Bartlesville, about 20 miles northeast.\n\n\"We did take a direct hit from a tornado\" in the city, said Kary Fox of the Washington County Emergency Management. \"Please stay off the roadways. Stay out of those damaged areas. We're having a lot of difficulty getting in to do assessments to check on people, to see if they've got any injuries because of the traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley on Tuesday with a possibility of few, potentially strong, tornadoes, hail and severe, damaging winds.\n\nThe main threat was shifting east into on Tuesday, said Roger Edwards, lead forecaster with the center, though it is not as intense a threat as on Monday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa had warned Monday evening that \"a large and life-threatening tornado\" was headed toward Barnsdall, with wind gusts up to 70 mph (112 kph). Meteorologist Brad McGavock said information on the tornado's size and how far it traveled wasn't immediately available Monday night.\n\nThe storms began earlier Monday with gusty winds and rain. But after dark, tornadoes were spotted skirting northern Oklahoma. At one point in the evening, a storm in the small town of Covington had \"produced tornadoes off and on for over an hour,\" the National Weather Service said. Throughout the area, wind farm turbines spun rapidly in the wind and blinding rain.\n\nIn Kansas, some areas were pelted by apple-sized hail 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter.\n\nThe storms tore through Oklahoma as areas, including Sulphur and Holdenville, were still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nOklahoma's State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates storm response from a bunker near the state Capitol, remains activated from last weekend's deadly storms.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMonte Tucker, a farmer and rancher in the western Oklahoma town of Sweetwater, had spent Monday putting some of his tractors and heavy equipment in barns to protect it from hail. He said he let his neighbors know they could come to his house if the weather becomes dangerous.\n\n\"We built a house 10 years ago, and my stubborn wife put her foot down and made sure we built a safe room,\" Tucker said. He said the entire ground-level room is built with reinforced concrete walls.\n\nOklahoma and Kansas had been under a high-risk weather warning Monday. The last time such a warning was issued was March 31, 2023, when a massive storm system tore through parts of the South and Midwest including Arkansas, Illinois and rural Indiana.\n\nThe entire week is looking stormy across the U.S. The eastern U.S. and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati, cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, floodwaters in the Houston area began receding Monday after days of heavy rain in southeastern Texas left neighborhoods flooded and led to hundreds of high-water rescues.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit and Salter from O'Fallon, Missouri.

Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nThere were no serious injuries immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people.

As some communities pick up the pieces, others were preparing Tuesday for the threat of strong twisters in the Midwest.\n\n* One dead, several injured: At least one person is dead and several others are injured after a tornado tore through Oklahoma's Osage and Washington counties Monday night, Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden said in an on-air interview with CNN affiliate KOKI. Extensive damage occurred to dozens of homes between Barnsdall and Bartlesville. A search was ongoing in Barnsdall Tuesday for \"one or two\" people still unaccounted for, the town's mayor Johnny Kelley said at a news conference.\n\n* Tornado damage in at least two other states: A tornado caused \"considerable damage\" in Sullivan, Missouri, late Monday night according to storm reports. The extent of the damage is unclear, but images from the scene showed buildings filleted by the twister. Another tornado tore through parts of DeKalb County, Tennessee, and damaged at least a dozen homes in the Smithville area early Monday afternoon, officials told CNN.\n\n* More than 200 storm reports: There were 244 storm reports Monday, including 17 tornado reports, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Hail the size of softballs slammed down in Kansas while baseball-sized hail pummeled Oklahoma. Wind gusts of 70 mph or greater were recorded in Nebraska and Kansas while an 82-mph wind gust occurred near Chester, Oklahoma.\n\n* Rare high risk issued: Monday marked the first high - Level 5 of 5 - risk issued for the US by the Storm Prediction Center in more than a year. It was the first time in nearly five years Oklahoma was under such an extreme risk and the first time in nearly seven years in Kansas.\n\n* More storms to come: Level 3 of 5 risks for severe thunderstorms are in place for parts of the US on Tuesday and Wednesday, with millions at risk of damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes.\n\nTown hit by tornado for the second time in five weeks\n\nMonday night's triggered a tornado emergency for Barnsdall, Oklahoma, but residents here were all too familiar with the situation. It was the second damaging tornado in just over a month to hit the town, which was struck by an EF1 on April 1.\n\nUnder the cover of darkness Monday night, the large and destructive tornado barreled through the town.\n\nDorothy Aultz and her son Carl Kelley were at Dorothy's Barnsdall home when the tornado hit. Dorothy is elderly and receiving hospice care, Carl told CNN, so he went to his mother's home to protect her during the storm.\n\nWith a tornado on the way and no basement to shelter in, Carl had to improvise. He placed blankets on the bathroom floor, placed Dorothy on them and laid on top of her to protect her from debris.\n\nThe tornado tore through the home and destroyed most of it, but the bathroom held strong. Both mother and son made through the experience unscathed and were rescued from the rubble.\n\nThey were among the roughly two dozen people rescued from their damaged or destroyed homes Monday night, Kelley, the city's mayor, said in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nThe full extent of the tornado's destruction in Barnsdall didn't become clear until the sun rose Tuesday. Much of the town has \"significant damage;\" a nursing home was damaged and evacuated; and several homes were \"completely leveled,\" Kelley said.\n\nBut it's the loss of a man Kelley knew well in this close-knit community of 1,400 that will stick with him, he said.\n\n\"To me, the material things are material, you can replace them,\" Kelley said. \"The loss of life, it's something that's forever.\"\n\nTornado threat shifts to Midwest, Tennessee Valley Tuesday\n\nStrong storms shifted east on Tuesday and have ushered in a renewed threat of damaging wind gusts, large hail and tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorms got underway Tuesday afternoon in parts of Illinois but will expand across much of the Midwest and Tennessee Valley through the evening.\n\nNearly 13 million people here are at risk of a few strong tornadoes of at least EF2 strength. The Level 3 of 5 risk area includes large portions of Indiana, including Indianapolis; Kentucky, including Louisville; and Ohio, including Columbus.\n\nDamaging winds and hail are possible outside of the highest risk area across a huge portion of the eastern US.\n\nMillions are at risk of damaging storms once again on Wednesday, including areas hard-hit by Monday's storms.\n\nAn expansive Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from northeastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma to much of Kentucky and Tennessee. Damaging wind gusts, hail bigger than baseballs and tornadoes are all possible within Wednesday's storms.\n\nSome strong tornadoes are possible, mainly from Missouri through central Kentucky and northern Tennessee. St. Louis and Nashville are just two cities at risk of powerful tornadoes.\n\nTorrential rainfall may also occur within any storm Wednesday and trigger flash flooding. A Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place for a large portion of the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Rainfall rates could approach 1 to 2 inches per hour in the heaviest storms.\n\nCNN's Joe Sutton, Lucy Kafanov, Robert Shackelford and Andi Babineau contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news

The NWS referred to a \"large and destructive tornado\" moving towards Barnsdall and causing catastrophic damage.\n\nOsage County Emergency Management Director Jerry Roberts told FOX Weather that Oklahoma Task Force 1 Tulsa, along with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and crews from numerous jurisdictions, arrived in Barnsdall overnight to aid in the search for survivors.\n\n\"Right now, we have a big area of total destruction,\" Roberts adds.\n\nAccording to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, as many as 40 homes were damaged in the Barnsdall area. Multiple reports of natural gas leaks and debris in roadways led to the closure of numerous roads.\n\nThe Oklahoma State Department of Health said the town's nursing home was damaged, and patients were evacuated to nearby facilities. No nursing home patients suffered injuries requiring hospital care, state officials said.\n\nThe Tornado Emergency for Barnsdall was just the second one ever issued by the NWS in Tulsa, and one of 13 Tornado Warnings issued by that office on Monday.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

The tornado, which struck in the late afternoon, left residents reeling from the widespread damage and destruction.\n\nThe drone footage shows that the tornado carved a path of chaos through Barnsdall, north of Tulsa, demolishing homes, uprooting trees, and sending debris flying. Eyewitnesses described scenes of utter devastation, with buildings reduced to rubble and vehicles tossed aside by the powerful winds.\n\nTulsa TV station KOTV reported that Osage County Sheriff Eddie Virden confirmed that one person had died in Barnsdall on Monday. This is the second time Barnsdall has been hit by a tornado in a month.\n\nThe mayor of Barnsdall, Johnny Kelley, told Fox News that an attempt to activate sirens had failed because they malfunctioned after a lightning strike.\n\nHe said: \"In between the 60 seconds or so it takes for the sirens to activate, our siren on the hill took a direct lightning strike and it got the breaker and then our other two sirens, it blew up the AC/DC converters in both of those.\"\n\nThe Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management has asked residents to report damage to their property at damage.ok.gov., which they say helps local and state emergency managers better coordinate response and recovery efforts. The department is coordinating with several Oklahoma agencies and organizations including the Highway Patrol, State Department of Health, National Guard, Department of Transportation, Office of Homeland Security, Department of Agriculture, and Oklahoma American Red Cross.\n\nThe full extent of the destruction is still being assessed, but preliminary reports suggest that hundreds of homes have been damaged or destroyed, leaving many families homeless. Power lines have been downed, roads blocked, and communication networks disrupted, further complicating recovery efforts.\n\nOklahoma State Department of Health reported that a nursing home was damaged and patients evacuated.\n\n\"Please pray for us,\" the Barnsdall Nursing Home wrote on social media.\n\nOklahoma Highway Patrol was assisting with rescues as several roads were closed because of debris.\n\nThe Red Cross set up shelters for displaced residents, offering food, water and medical aid to those affected by the tornado.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

A hotel in the town was severely damaged, as shown in social media posts uploaded by witnesses -- firefighters were called to rescue some people trapped inside.\n\nBartlesville's city's government said there had been significant damage across Bartlesville, with some power lines down, but only minor injuries reported so far. Residents were urged to stay inside and stay off the roads.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a rare tornado emergency statement for Osage on Monday. \"A large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly tornado is on the ground,\" it said. The tornado watch was extended until 5 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nOsage Nation Emergency Management and local police said on Facebook it had joined \"numerous agencies for search and rescue through the Osage Nation Reservation.\"\n\n\"Our community is strong and eager to help those in need,\" it said.\n\nAcross Oklahoma, more than 25,000 energy customers were without power as of 5 a.m. local time Tuesday, according to the website PowerOutage.us, while 18,000 were without power in Missouri and almost 10,000 in Arkansas.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the severe weather -- which has affected parts of the country for more than five weeks -- will continue at least into Wednesday as an area of low pressure develops over the Great Lakes.\n\nA tornado also swept through Smithville, Tennessee, bringing down trees and damaging houses, as seen in footage uploaded to social media.\n\nThree people had been confirmed dead in Texas as a result of storms and floods there, Gov.

It's a similar story for two towns in western Iowa.\n\nStrong tornado Monday night: A supercell thunderstorm spawned what appeared to be a strong tornado in northeast Oklahoma Monday night. It plowed through Barnsdall, about 30 miles north-northwest of downtown Tulsa.\n\nVideo and photos Tuesday morning showed the extent of the devastation in the town, where 30 to 40 homes were damaged or destroyed and at least one person lost their life.\n\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days - only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nBarnsdall d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: Just five weeks ago, an EF1 tornado tore a 2-mile path through the southeast side of Barnsdall, damaging homes and outbuildings. That was one of five tornadoes spawned by a supercell thunderstorm on the evening of April 1, according to the National Weather Service in Tulsa.\n\nIowa towns also hit again: At the same time the tornado was tracking toward Barnsdall, radar confimed another tornado was in progress in western Iowa.\n\nSpecifically, it was near the towns of Minden and Shelby.\n\nIf you've been following our coverage the past few weeks, those towns may sound familiar. Just over two weeks ago, a tornado outbreak struck the Plains, including Nebraska and Iowa. An EF3 tornado tracked through parts of Minden, then west of Shelby on April 26. One house in Minden was detached from its foundation and slid 10 yards.\n\nBarnsdall was fairly lucky before this year: According to data compiled by the NWS-Norman, Oklahoma, office, 108 tornadoes were documented in Osage County, Oklahoma, from 1950 through 2023, an average of one to two per year.\n\nWhile a number of them have been strong - at least F/EF2 rating - previous tornadoes around Barnsdall appear to have been weak, rated either F/EF0 or 1.\n\nMORE ON WEATHER.COM\n\n- How To Prepare For Severe Weather Like A Meteorologist\n\n- How NWS Damage Surveys Estimate A Tornado's Strength\n\n- The Enhanced Fujita Scale: A Tornado Rating System\n\nJonathan Erdman is a senior meteorologist at weather.com and has been covering national and international weather since 1996.

The storm cellar door she was hiding in then blew open, and debris started to fly everywhere. \"I even had it latched to a bolt in the floor, and it just ripped it off.\"\n\nBartlesville, 20 miles to the northeast of Tulsa, was affected in a similar way. A hotel in the town was severely damaged, as several social media posts began to surface from multiple witnesses, which resulted in firefighters being called in to rescue people trapped inside.\n\nBartlesville's city's government said there had been significant damage across the area, with power lines being hit causing them to go out. Minor injuries have been reported so far and residents were told to stay inside and off the roads.\n\nAdditionally, the National Weather Service issued a rare tornado emergency statement for Osage on Monday. \"A large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly tornado is on the ground,\" it said. The tornado watch was extended until 5 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nOsage Nation Emergency Management along with local police said on Facebook it had joined \"numerous agencies for search and rescue through the Osage Nation Reservation.\"\n\n\"Our community is strong and eager to help those in need,\" it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sooner State saw over 25,000 energy customers were without power as of 5 a.m. local time Tuesday, according to the website PowerOutage.us, with 18,000 without power in Missouri and close to 10,000 in Arkansas.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heavy weather will continue into Wednesday as an area of low pressure develops over the Great Lakes.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott also said on Monday that three people had been confirmed dead in Texas as a result of the harsh storms.\n\nCurrently, severe thunderstorms are still moving across the Midwest at a rapid pace, with over 29 million people under a severe storm risk, which include areas in Tennessee, Ohio River Valleys, Chicago; Nashville, Tennessee; Toledo, Ohio; and Ann Arbor, Michigan could also see devastating weather.\n\nStay informed!

It was concerning enough that I even took the closing segment of the (political) show I sub-hosted on Monday to discuss that likelihood and the importance of weather awareness.\n\nThis gives an idea of how the outlook appeared as of mid-day on Monday.\n\nAs I alluded to in the segment, once I was home and settled, I parked in front of the computer and began following Tornado Twitter and watching the pertinent live streams. I've referenced Ryan Hall's channel previously. I recently found \"Max Velocity\" and recommend his channel as well.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nTwisted: A Second Night of Monster Midwest Tornadoes Brings Devastation to Oklahoma\n\nVideo: Incredible Tornadoes Wreak Havoc Across the Heartland\n\nOf course, the storm chasers were out in full force, many of them in Oklahoma, since that appeared to be where the risk was highest. A few storms kicked up through the afternoon and early evening, but nothing of particular note -- so much so that the chatter on the channels began to speculate maybe the threat wouldn't materialize. (And yes, there are some for whom this spells disappointment, even while it's clearly a blessing.)\n\nThat changed around 9:30 pm Central when a monstrous storm kicked up northwest of Tulsa.\n\nSoon came descriptions of a large debris ball lofted high.\n\nA Tornado Emergency was declared.\n\nTornado Emergencies are rare and only issued when 'severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage are imminent or ongoing' for a confirmed tornado.\n\nThe storm ripped through the small town of Barnsdall, Oklahoma, population 1,015, before taking aim at Bartlesville, which has a population of close to 38,000. I'll let the video and images shared on Twitter in the aftermath speak for themselves here:\n\nThese videos taken from the Hampton Inn in Bartlesville show the force of the storm.\n\nWarning: Language\n\nDrone footage taken Tuesday morning demonstrates why that second video shows how not to ride out a storm of this nature.\n\nBut it was tiny Barnsdall that really took the brunt of things. This is utterly heartbreaking.\n\nAmazingly, per local reports, only one fatality has been reported thus far, though there are multiple injuries.\n\nBarnsdall Mayor John Kelley confirmed that a person died after a tornado hit the city in northeastern Oklahoma late Monday night. Information about the victim has not been released.\n\nKelley added that seven or eight injuries also have been reported in Barnsdall, and a firefighter was taken to a hospital with chest pains.\n\nOEM officials said in their weather update that five injuries were reported in the Bartlesville and Washington County area.\n\nMonday's hit comes just a little over a month after an EF-1 tornado struck Barnsdall. The sirens didn't activate in that April storm due to a lightning strike. There are reports the sirens did not go off Monday night either.\n\nWhich highlights how critical it is to be and remain weather-aware -- and not just to rely on the sirens. Thankfully, Barnsdall had some lead time based on the warnings issued and radar confirmation of the storm.\n\nThat heads-up from the National Weather Service in Tulsa likely saved lives. While a huge swath of the town is utterly destroyed, it's a blessing the human casualties weren't worse.\n\nWe're not out of the woods yet, though, folks. Tuesday's and Wednesday's forecasts include enhanced risks again -- Tuesday, more to the east (Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky); Wednesday, a bit to the south (Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee).\n\nSo, consider this a Public Service Announcement from me if you're in or near an area at risk: Stay alert. Have a plan. Have a safe place to shelter if need be (lowest level, most interior room, away from windows). Have your devices charged; have close-toed shoes and a flashlight handy. Use those radar apps. And, if you would, say a prayer for the people impacted by these storms and in the path of the ones to come.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors":

Like painfully, just repeatedly. It felt like all the air came out of our cellar. It was a pressurized feeling. None of us had been through anything like that. We didn't really feel that with the first one.\"\n\nRight after the storm had passed, her sons jumped into action to help save her daughter, who was trapped in her cellar with her family on the other side of town.\n\n\"They ran out during the storm, cut down a tree to get them out of their cellar because it had fallen on top of the cellar door. We stayed down for another 20 or 30 minutes before we came out,\" said Love. \"Our yard, it looks good now, but it was covered in tree limbs, it was covered in debris. From where, we don't even know.\"\n\nShe can now see a subdivision she couldn't see before because so many trees are now down, and lots of her neighbors' things and parts of their houses and businesses are now on Susan's lawn.\n\n\"Stuff that wasn't ours was everywhere. We had stairs, flooring, stuff that looked like it came from the plant. I don't think we were ready for that one either,\" she said.\n\nShe feels lucky it wasn't worse, and her heart goes out to the people who lost everything.\n\nShe has faith in her town and its people and believes they will come back stronger.\n\n\"We all get together and help our neighbors, and Barnsdall will push through it. We always do. That's one good thing about living here, is that everybody always comes together.

The person was filming underneath the portico of a Hampton Inn motel as a tornado was rolling in and at two points in the clip the sky flashes electric blue creating a Sci-Fi effect as if aliens were invading or depicting a scene straight out of Stranger Things.\n\nAs conditions quickly go from bad to worse to 'seek shelter immediately' the person rushes inside the hotel to seek cover from the destructive storm as the hotel reportedly sustained a direct hit from the Bartlesville, Oklahoma tornado. This is some of the wildest first-person footage we have seen of a tornado hitting over the past week as Tornado Alley was repeatedly battered:\n\nThe damage from that direct hit was so bad there are literally wooden spikes sticking straight out the side of the Hampton Inn building as structures came loose and boards flew threw the air fast enough to become lodged in the side of the motel.\n\nAs for the sky turning blue, that is unclear. Typically the skies turn green right before tornadoes but the flashing blue light is likely due to electrical explosions under the city lights.\n\nThe same storm cell that produced this Bartlesville, Oklahoma tornado also produced tornados in nearby Barnsdall where aerial footage filmed using drones the next morning shows the scale of destruction left in the path of these powerful tornadoes:\n\nThat first video of the Hampton Inn being disintegrated is eerily reminiscent of this video from Nebraska that was shot on April 26th when an EF-3 tornado hit Lincoln. Someone sitting in their vehicle filmed as a whole building was there one moment and gone a few seconds later:\n\nWhile the traditional 'Tornado Alley' has shifted about 450 miles eastward in the past 70 years, these storms over the past few weeks have hammered the region historically known as Tornado Alley.

An EF-1 twister hit the town on April 1.\n\nThe storm this week then moved into Bartlesville and caused significant damage there as well, though no one was killed, according to a post on the city's Facebook page.\n\nTornadoes struck portions of Missouri and Tennessee, too.\n\nIn Sullivan, Missouri, tornadoes on Tuesday, May 7, severely damaged a popular spot known as One More Pub and Grub as well as the local high school, according to FOX affiliate KTVI and CBS affiliate KMOV.\n\nAnd two radar-indicated tornadoes touched down in Middle Tennessee on Monday afternoon, causing damage in Wilson and DeKalb counties, NBC affiliate WSMV-TV reported.\n\nThe National Weather Service will be assessing damage from each of the storms on Tuesday.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn addition to tornadoes, the storms delivered strong winds, heavy rain and large hail to impacted areas.

Seven to eight people were also injured and one person was unaccounted for.\n\nAn OHP Trooper evacuated News 4 from a damage area Tuesday afternoon saying they were actively looking for \"human remains.\" News 4 asked several other law enforcement officials if they were looking for one person or multiple, but we were told a number could not be given.\n\nAt this time, only one individual has been publicly revealed as unaccounted for.\n\nThe Osage County Sheriff's Office has identified that individual as Wayne Hogue. The department's social media post says Hogue went missing from the Barnsdall area following the tornado Monday night.\n\nNo official update on Hogue's whereabouts as of Tuesday night.\n\n\"It's just a whole new reality. It's crazy,\" said Billy Moles. He lost the entirety of his home in Monday's tornado.\n\nMoles has lived in Barnsdall for three decades.\n\nHe said he was watching TV in his living room when tornado warning sirens started sounding off. He quickly flipped the channel to check the weather and that's when he said he realized he needed to hide.\n\nMoles fled to his uncle's home nearby to use his storm cellar.\n\n\"You talk about the train roar. It's pretty close,\" said Moles. \"Now a part of my house is here and part of my house is over there. It went pretty quick. It was traveling pretty quick. You're kind of in shock. You don't know what to do.\"\n\nMoles said he didn't think to take his medication or documents, such as his car title with him to his uncle's and now all of it is beneath the mess this tornado left behind.\n\nJack Miller also lost his home in the storm. He's lived in the same home since 1973.\n\nMiller's cars were buried under mountains of debris. His home was exposed as a wall was ripped off.\n\n\"You could hear it coming. I couldn't see it because there [were] too many trees,\" said Miller. \"You could feel the depression in the air. It seemed like it was here and gone.\"\n\nMiller said he and his family rushed to their storm cellar with moments left to spare before the tornado hit his neighborhood.\n\n\"I could hear things hitting the top of the cellar door and, of course, the debris going. I didn't expect this,\" stated Miller.\n\nHe recalled he and his grandson holding on to the cellar door in hopes the tornado wouldn't swing it open.\n\n\"It still [doesn't] feel real. It feels like I'm just going to wake up here in a little bit and it's gonna be all right,\" said Miller.\n\nScattered across his yard were memories of his family and where he came from.\n\nWhen asked what his favorite memory was, he said through tears, \"I got so many memories. They're all my favorite. I was going to say when my kids were born here, but I've got great grand-kids, too. They come and visit it a lot. They loved it here. I'm just thankful everybody's fine. Everybody's okay.\"\n\nMiller said all he can do at this point is \"pick up and move on.\"\n\nJaymee Babb told News 4 she rode the storm out in her father's cellar while her husband and son were in Miller's storm shelter.\n\n\"It's terrifying and heartbreaking,\" she said. \"Other than we're missing one animal, we're all safe here.\"\n\nBabb has lived in Barnsdall her entire life, but the home this Monday's tornado destroyed had been hers for the last 12 years.\n\n\"We're a small town, but we're all family. It's heartbreaking to see everybody have to go through all this,\" said Babb. \"A lot of them went through this a month ago.\"\n\nBabb said she's thankful for the endless support and kindness she has received since the storm hit.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" she added.\n\nIf your home was damaged or destroyed in the tornado, the Oklahoma Insurance Department has a list of resources available.", "source": {"uri": "kfor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KFOR 4 Oklahoma City"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaylee_olivas@kfor.com", "name": "Kaylee Olivas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enhanced Fujita scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsdall,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barnsdall, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barnsdall, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_power_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overhead power line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tulsa, Oklahoma"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense siren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tornado warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_cellar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm cellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayne County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_County,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Osage County, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osage County, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Department_of_Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Department of Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/image_05aff1.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545208", "eventUri": "eng-9545208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

By Tuesday morning, the town of Barnsdall was grappling with the devastation, as this comes just weeks after the town was hit by an EF-1 tornado.\n\nBarnsdall, a town of roughly 1,000, is no stranger to storms. But NBC 5 spoke to people on the ground who said they had never seen damage like this in their decades of living here. The cleanup has begun, and the community is stepping up in a big way.\n\nA natural gas leak and numerous road closings due to debris were reported early Tuesday morning, according to Osage County Emergency Management. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt toured the damage and addressed reporters Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"You know, when you when you see this type of damage, it's just it's just heartbreaking. You just don't know how anybody can survive,\" said Governor Stitt\n\nDozens of homes were leveled after taking a direct hit. Joy Washington told NBC 5 she'd lived in her house some 50 years. Within minutes, everything was ripped apart.\n\n\"Can you believe? Can you believe it did all this?\" she asked.\n\nShe said she grabbed a few belongings and took shelter in her bathroom as the storm passed.\n\n\"Just disbelief when I came out here and seen my roof here was gone and I seen the roof back there was gone,\" Washington said.\n\nRyan Gott is associate pastor at the Lighthouse Family Worship Center less than a mile up the road from the worst of the damage. The church is now a resource pickup and drop-off center for people needing basics. Walmart delivered 43,000 pounds of water to add to donations brought in from residents.\n\n\"It's just really hard to put into words what we're dealing with right now, but we have a great community, we're going to pull together,\" Gott said.\n\nLongtime resident Arlyn Hendricks was thankful to see his house still standing, even with significant damage. He said the road to recovery will be long.\n\n\"If you look at the overall picture of things it's overwhelming. So, you just have to do the little that you can do,\" said resident Hendrick.\n\nAs of 8 p.m. Tuesday, at least one fatality had been confirmed and a search continued for a missing person.

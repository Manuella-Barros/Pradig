Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nHarris said in remarks after what she called a \"frank and constructive meeting\" with the Israeli leader that she supports Israel's right to defend itself, but said, \"how it does so matters.\"\n\nShe expressed concern over the \"devastating\" humanitarian situation in Gaza and images of civilians killed in the conflict, saying, \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.\"\n\nShe echoed Biden in calling for a swift cease-fire to end the fighting, at least for a time, to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza and release some of the most vulnerable hostages from Hamas captivity.\n\nWhite House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\n-- -\n\nAP writer Ashraf Khalil contributed reporting.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nHarris said in remarks after what she called a \"frank and constructive meeting\" with the Israeli leader that she supports Israel's right to defend itself, but said, \"how it does so matters.\"\n\nShe expressed concern over the \"devastating\" humanitarian situation in Gaza and images of civilians killed in the conflict, saying, \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.\"\n\nShe echoed Biden in calling for a swift cease-fire to end the fighting, at least for a time, to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza and release some of the most vulnerable hostages from Hamas captivity.\n\nWhite House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\n-- -\n\nAP writer Ashraf Khalil contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris is scheduled to meet separately on Thursday with Netanyahu. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, in a fiery address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "wthr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTHR-TV 13 NBC Indianapolis"}, "authors":

Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,\" Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. \"And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.\"\n\nNetanyahu met separately earlier in the day with President Joe Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire.\n\nHarris said following her meeting with Netanyahu that Israel's war in Gaza is more complicated than simply about people being supportive of one side or the other.\n\n\"Too often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris also condemned Hamas' brutality. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.\n\nKirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \"but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nWith Harris' forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nAhead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting on Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the Vice President was \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nWATCH: Mideast analysts weigh in on Netanyahu's address and if it could affect support for Israel\n\nHarris said in remarks after what she called a \"frank and constructive meeting\" with the Israeli leader that she supports Israel's right to defend itself, but said, \"how it does so matters.\"\n\nShe expressed concern over the \"devastating\" humanitarian situation in Gaza and images of civilians killed in the conflict, saying, \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.\"\n\nShe echoed Biden in calling for a swift cease-fire to end the fighting, at least for a time, to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza and release some of the most vulnerable hostages from Hamas captivity.\n\nWhite House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\nAP writer Ashraf Khalil contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news",

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris is scheduled to meet separately on Thursday with Netanyahu. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, in a fiery address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\n-- -\n\nAP writer Ashraf Khalil contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com",

Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,\" Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. \"And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.\"\n\nNetanyahu met separately earlier in the day with President Joe Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire.\n\nHarris said following her meeting with Netanyahu that Israel's war in Gaza is more complicated than simply about people being supportive of one side or the other.\n\n\"Too often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris also condemned Hamas' brutality. White House national security council spokesman John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.\n\nKirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \"but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nWith Harris' forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nAhead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting on Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nHarris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu also derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nAnd it said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for prime minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, many of whom have called on Netanyahu to reach a deal.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war.\n\nThe meeting is Netanyahu's first visit to the White House during Biden's presidency. They also met in New York last year and when Biden traveled to Israel days after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu at the airport.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli will meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/sst", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news",

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nAnd it said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for prime minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, many of whom have called on Netanyahu to reach a deal.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nMore from this section Taiwan: Winds And Rain Pick Up Ahead Of Typhoon Gaemi Landfall 5 Are you getting the most out of your tax-free savings account? Prince Harry 'not getting enough credit' for taking Invictus Games to new heights since leaving UK\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war.\n\nThe meeting is Netanyahu's first visit to the White House during Biden's presidency. They also met in New York last year and when Biden traveled to Israel days after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu at the airport.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli will meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/sst", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a ceasefire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a ceasefire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and President Biden.\n\nThe White House said President Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nAnd it said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress yesterday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise,\" Mr Kirby said.\n\nPresident Biden and Mr Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, many of whom have called on Mr Netanyahu to reach a deal.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Mr Netanyahu's speech to politicians.\n\nMs Harris condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\nWhile Joe Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's 7 October attacks, relations with Mr Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war.\n\nThe meeting is Mr Netanyahu's first visit to the White House during Joe Biden's presidency.\n\nThey also met in New York last year and when President Biden travelled to Israel days after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu at the airport.\n\nA senior US administration official said that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the \"closing stages\" and that Joe Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with mr Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Mr Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza\".\n\nBut in a further sign of Joe Biden's diminishing relevance, and Mr Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli will meet Donald Trump in Florida tomorrow.\n\nThe ex-president urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on 7 October resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\n-- -\n\nAP writer Ashraf Khalil contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com",

We got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said in brief remarks shortly before cameras left the room.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- who is seeking to succeed Biden -- met with Netanyahu later in the day and took the lead in addressing the public about their discussions.\n\nShe has been more outspoken than Biden about killed Palestinian civilians and called on Israel to allow more humanitarian aid in, and later stressed the importance for Israel to avoid more civilian casualties in Gaza.\n\n\"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,\" Harris said following her meeting.\n\nThe meetings came just hours after Biden, in an Oval Office address, told Americans that getting peace in Gaza -- ending the fighting between Israel and Hamas and freeing hostages -- is one of his top goals in his remaining six months in office. Netanyahu so far has resisted Biden's efforts, rejecting his calls for a cease-fire.\n\nNetanyahu brought up their long relationship and other Israeli leaders Biden has known throughout his career.\n\nMORE: Israel-Gaza live updates\n\n\"From a proud Jew Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nBiden reflected on that first meeting, joking, \"I was only 12 then.\"\n\nOther U.S. officials attending included Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the president was going to press Netanyahu to help \"close the gaps\" with the peace deal that would return the Israeli hostages.\n\n\"We are closer now than we have ever been before,\" he said.\n\nThe meeting between Netanyahu and the president lasted for about an hour and a half, the Israeli prime minister's office said.\n\nIt was the first time the leaders have come face-to-face since Biden announced he was dropping out of the presidential race and endorsed Harris' run.\n\nBoth leaders met with American families of Israeli hostages, according to the White House.\n\nJonathan Dekel-Chen, one of the family members, told reporters following their meeting that they felt \"more optimistic than we have since the first round of the releases in late November, early December.\"\n\n\"We got absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now, to waste no time, and to complete this deal as it currently stands,\" he said.\n\nThe families also brushed off concerns that Biden not seeking a second term could hurt the chances of a deal coming together, arguing it could actually help.\n\n\"I actually think it allows the president to be laser-focused on the things that are true priorities to him, and saving human beings, cherished human beings,\" Rachel Goldberg, the mother of hostage Hersch Goldberg-Polin, said.\n\nKirby would not comment on why Harris was meeting with Netanyahu later but noted that she had campaign events while Biden met with the prime minister.\n\nHarris and Netanyahu shook hands before U.S. and Israeli flags around 5:10 p.m. in her ceremonial office.\n\nOnly Harris spoke to reporters following the meetings and reiterated that Israel has the right to defend itself but added, \"how it does so matters.\"\n\n\"I have met with the families of these American hostages multiple times now, and I've told them each time they are not alone, and I stand with them. And President Biden and I are working every day to bring them home,\" she said.\n\nHarris said that she talked to Netanyahu about her \"serious concern\" about the collateral damage and suffering of Gazan civilians.\n\n\"With over 2 million people facing high levels of food insecurity, and half a million people facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity. What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating; the images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" she said.\n\nHarris addressed the groups who have been calling for a cease-fire and peace in the Middle East, and pushed for a two-state solution saying \"I see you, I hear you.\"\n\n\"Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. And let us condemn antisemitism, Islamophobia and hate of any kind. And let us work to unite our country,\" she said.\n\nThe White House meeting comes a day after Netanyahu addressed a joint meeting of Congress, which Harris did not attend, holding a previously scheduled campaign event instead.\n\nThe prime minister has praised Biden for \"half century of friendship to Israel\" and U.S. support following the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"He rightly called Hamas 'sheer evil.' He dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Middle East to deter a wider war. And he came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour -- a visit that will never be forgotten,\" Netanyahu said in his speech to lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nThe prime minister did not mention Harris. But he did laud former President Donald Trump for his support of Israel during his four years in office.\n\nMORE: Fact-checking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress\n\nNetanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump Friday at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe prime minister has called on the U.S. to provide bipartisan support for Israel during the conflict and urged leaders to, \"Give us the tools faster and we'll finish the job faster.\"\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its role in Gaza and bring all our hostages home. That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nIn May, Biden paused a shipment to Israel of unguided bombs citing concerns that they could be used on civilians.\n\nCongress sent $26 billion in aid to Israel and provided humanitarian relief for people in Gaza in April as part of a foreign aid package.\n\nAbout $4 billion of that was dedicated to replenishing Israel's missile defense systems. More than $9 billion of the total went toward humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nHarris pushes cease-fire after Netanyahu meets with her, Biden separately originally appeared on abcnews.go.com",

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nHarris said in remarks after what she called a \"frank and constructive meeting\" with the Israeli leader that she supports Israel's right to defend itself, but said, \"how it does so matters.\"\n\nShe expressed concern over the \"devastating\" humanitarian situation in Gaza and images of civilians killed in the conflict, saying, \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.\"\n\nShe echoed Biden in calling for a swift cease-fire to end the fighting, at least for a time, to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza and release some of the most vulnerable hostages from Hamas captivity.\n\nWhite House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\n\"The gaps are closable,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the conflict and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during its military offensive in Gaza and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nHarris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she's been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel.\n\nShe used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians \"starving\" in the face of \"inhumane\" conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [],

Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,\" Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. \"And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.\"\n\nRelated Story: House Republicans Vote to Rebuke Kamala Harris Over Handling of Border Policy\n\nNetanyahu met separately earlier in the day with President Joe Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire.\n\nHarris said following her meeting with Netanyahu that Israel's war in Gaza is more complicated than simply about people being supportive of one side or the other.\n\n\"Too often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris also condemned Hamas' brutality. White House national security council spokesman John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.\n\nRelated Story: Harris Narrows Gap Against Trump, Times/Siena Poll Finds\n\nKirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \"but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nWith Harris' forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nRelated Story: How to Decode Kamala Harris's Foreign Policy\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nAhead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting on Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nRelated Story: House Republicans Vote to Rebuke Kamala Harris Over Handling of Border Policy\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nHarris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nRelated Story: Harris Narrows Gap Against Trump, Times/Siena Poll Finds\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\nRelated Story: How to Decode Kamala Harris's Foreign Policy\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu also derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nAnd it said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for prime minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, many of whom have called on Netanyahu to reach a deal.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war.\n\nThe meeting is Netanyahu's first visit to the White House during Biden's presidency. They also met in New York last year and when Biden traveled to Israel days after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu at the airport.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli will meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/sst\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri":

Netanyahu, however, has avoided committing to a cease-fire deal and pledged to only end the war once Hamas is destroyed.\n\nNetanyahu, in the meeting, praised Biden for his years of support for Israel.\n\n\"From a proud Jew Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu said. \"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.\"\n\nIt was the first time the two leaders met face to face since Biden visited Israel shortly after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. The meeting also was Biden's first with a foreign leader since he dropped out of the presidential race and passed his campaign on to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhite House national security communications adviser John Kirby, who was in the meeting, said Biden planned to pressure Netanyahu to accept a the cease-fire deal with Hamas.\n\n\"We feel that we've got to get this hostage deal in place so we can get a cease-fire also in place,\" Kirby said at a press briefing. \"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon.\"\n\nThe two also discussed the conflict between Lebanon and Israel and countering Iran and its proxies, Kirby said.\n\nHarris, who has been more outspoken than Biden about the Palestinians Israeli forces have killed, also meet with Netanyahu later Thursday.\n\nIn a press briefing after the meeting, Harris said she told Netanyahu it is time to get a cease-fire \"deal done,\" and that she \"will not be silent\" about the loss of Palestinian lives.\n\n\"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal. And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. So to everyone who has been calling for a cease-fire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you,\" Harris said.\n\nKirby said both leaders later met with American families of Israeli hostages.\n\nJonathan Dekel-Chen, father of hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said the families feel \"more optimistic than we have since the first round of the releases in late November, early December.\"\n\n\"We got absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now, to waste no time, and to complete this deal as it currently stands,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu was scheduled to meet with former President Donald Trump Friday at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe prime minister faces growing discontent at home over his handling of the war with Hamas. Hostage families have repeatedly called for him to accept a deal that would ensure their loved ones return home.\n\nProtests against his administration have risen since Oct. 7 and are now a daily occurrence. Top Israeli officials also slandered him in a letter to Congress saying he has prioritized his political survival over the survival of the hostages.\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday addressed a joint meeting of Congress, which Harris did not attend as she was at a previously scheduled campaign event.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers also did not attend Netanyahu's address as a sign of protest over his handling of the war.\n\nNetanyahu in his address called pro-Palestinian protesters \"Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\n\"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming, 'Gays for Gaza,'\" Netanyahu said. \"They might as well hold up signs saying, 'Chickens for KFC.' These protesters chant, 'From the river to the sea,' but many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.\"\n\nWhen asked about Netanyahu's \"useful idiots\" remark on Thursday, Kirby said it's \"not a phrase we would use.\"\n\nNetanyahu has called on the United States to continue providing support for its campaign against Hamas.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its role in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBiden in May paused a shipment of unguided bombs to Israel saying he was concerned they could be used on civilians.\n\nCongress in April passed a major foreign aid package, which included $26 billion to bolster Israel's military and provide humanitarian relief for people in Gaza.\n\nAbout $4 billion of that went to replenishing Israel's missile defense systems, and over $9 billion was earmarked toward humanitarian aid in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nBiden speech: President appeals to Americans in solemn address 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe

Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nBiden speech: President appeals to Americans in solemn

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nWith all eyes on the likely Democratic nominee, Harris largely reiterated Biden's longstanding message that it's time find an endgame to the brutal war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have died. Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,\" Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. \"And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.\"\n\nNetanyahu met separately earlier in the day with President Joe Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire.\n\nHarris said following her meeting with Netanyahu that Israel's war in Gaza is more complicated than simply about people being supportive of one side or the other.\n\n\"Too often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris also condemned Hamas' brutality. White House national security council spokesman John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \"but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nWith Harris' forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAhead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting on Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nCardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views Tammie Holland, longtime St. Louis radio personality, dies at 53 Third bear sighting reported in southern Illinois, sheriff says Ranch in Wildwood is sanctuary for abused miniature horses Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist Former St. Louis Rams lineman ordered to pay $500,000 to injured worker Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000 O'Fallon, Mo., woman charged with making politically motivated false child sex abuse claim Messenger: A disturbing twist in the case of security guards who tackled BJC patient Messenger: He fixed up his mobile home.

He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors":

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nAnd it said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for prime minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, many of whom have called on Netanyahu to reach a deal.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war.\n\nThe meeting is Netanyahu's first visit to the White House during Biden's presidency. They also met in New York last year and when Biden traveled to Israel days after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu at the airport.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli will meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/sst\n\nMore from this section\n\nOptimal Blue Launches

We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.\"\n\nHarris said she would \"always\" ensure Israel's ability to defend itself, and pointed to what she described as a \"hopeful movement\" in talks to secure a cease-fire. She said she told the prime minister during their meeting that \"it is time to get this deal done.\"\n\n\"Let's get the deal done so we can get a cease-fire to end the war. Let's bring the hostages home, and let's provide much-needed relief to the Palestinian people. And ultimately, I remain committed to a path forward that can lead to a two-state solution,\" Harris said.\n\nShe did not take any questions from reporters after giving her remarks.\n\nThe meeting took on higher stakes, amid the 2024 election shakeup, as Harris runs for president following Biden's decision to withdraw from the race. Harris missed Netanyahu's speech before a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday because of a previously scheduled event in Indianapolis. Typically, the vice president presides over joint addresses.\n\nHours earlier, President Joe Biden hosted the Israeli leader in the Oval Office for a bilateral meeting and the two leaders met for roughly an hour with families of American hostages held hostage in Gaza.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the meeting, Netanyahu had thanked Biden for his 50 years of public service and his support of the state of Israel.\n\n\"Mr. President, we've known each other for 40 years, and you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years from Golda Meir. So from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nBiden offered only a few words in response before the media left, recalling meeting with Meir and joking that he was \"only 12 when it happened.\"\n\nThursday marked the first time Biden and Netanyahu have met in person since Biden visited Israel shortly after Hamas' terrorist attack on Oct. 7.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters Wednesday that Biden planned to discuss his \"ironclad commitment to Israel's security, the very serious threats from Iran and from Iranian proxy and terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis.\"\n\nThe official said the two leaders were expected to speak \"in depth\" about developments in Gaza, including efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement and the humanitarian crisis. The administration believes that a deal \"is in the closing stages and it's reaching a point that we believe a deal is closable, and it's time to move to close that agreement,\" the official said.\n\nFor her part, Harris has been engaged on the Israel-Gaza conflict for the last 10 months, the official said, including participating in every call with Netanyahu, as well as critical meetings like those with hostage families.\n\nDuring a briefing Thursday, National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told reporters that Biden was working with Netanyahu to fill gaps tied to striking a cease-fire deal.\n\nAsked whether Biden believed that Netanyahu wants to strike a cease-fire deal and that he is capable and willing to bridge the gaps, Kirby said: \"Yes, yes and yes. He has said so publicly himself. He wants to get the hostages home and the Israelis, the government, Prime Minister Netanyahu, has been working with us to try to get that deal over the finish line.\"\n\nIn his speech before Congress, Israel's prime minister thanked Biden \"for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families, as well.\"\n\n\"There will obviously be no daylight between the president and the vice president,\" the official said, adding they expect for a productive day because the Israelis will be at the White House for a while on Thursday.\n\nNetanyahu also thanked Biden for his leadership in his speech.\n\n\"I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on Oct. 7,\" Netanyahu said. \"He rightly called Hamas 'sheer evil.' He dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Middle East to deter a wider war. And he came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour -- a visit that will never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,\" he continued. \"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist. Actually, he says, a proud Irish American Zionist.\"\n\nNetanyahu is scheduled to meet with former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news",

And how it does so matters,\" Harris told reporters after the meeting. She said she raised her serious concerns about the scale of human suffering in Gaza.\n\n\"I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there,\" she said. \"I will not be silent.\"\n\nHarris' remarks, which were sharp and serious in tone, reflected what could be a shift from President Joe Biden in how she deals with Netanyahu.\n\nHours earlier, Biden pressed for a cease-fire to the nine-month-old war in Gaza in his first face-to-face talks with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel days after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and pledged American support.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby said gaps remain between Israel and the Hamas militants who run the Palestinian enclave in the drive for a ceasefire but \"we are closer now than we've been before.\"\n\n\"Both sides have to make compromises,\" Kirby said.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matt Miller said: \"I think the message from the American side in that meeting will be that we need to get this deal over the line.\"\n\nThe visit coincides with a shift in American politics. On Sunday, Biden, 81, stepped aside from the U.S. presidential race under pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed Harris for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n\"We've got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said when he welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office.\n\n\"I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nThe White House was ringed with extra security fencing to protect against protesters on Thursday.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu earlier met together with the families of American hostages held by Hamas. Representatives for the families told reporters after the meeting that they were hoping for a ceasefire deal that would bring the hostages home.\n\n\"We came today with a sense of urgency,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen. He said they were more optimistic of a deal since the first release of Israeli hostages from a previous ceasefire.\n\nSTRAINS IN BIDEN-NETANYAHU RELATIONS\n\nRelations between Biden and Netanyahu have been strained for months over Israel's Gaza offensive in which more than 39,000 people have been killed, according to health officials in Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. is a major arms supplier to Israel and has protected the country from critical United Nations votes.\n\nWhether Biden, who is now a \"lame duck\" president, a term used for officials who won't serve another term, or Harris, who is tied in many election polls with Republican rival Donald Trump, can have any influence on Netanyahu remains to be seen.\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu travels to Florida to meet Trump.\n\nHarris has been aligned with Biden on Israel but has struck a tougher tone.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people. Israel launched a retaliatory assault.\n\nHamas-led fighters took 250 captives on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.\n\nDEFIANT SPEECH\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu gave a defiant speech to the U.S. Congress in which he defended Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying anti-Israel protesters \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nThe Gaza conflict has splintered the Democratic Party, and sparked months of protests at Biden events. A drop in support among Arab-Americans could hurt Democratic chances in Michigan, one of a handful of states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.\n\nBiden's desire for unity in the party in the drive to defeat Trump was cited on Wednesday night in an Oval Office address as a main reason why he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race.\n\nNegotiations on a long-sought cease-fire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. officials have made similar pledges before about a cease-fire which evaporated under last-minute differences.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_holland@newsmax.com", "name": "Steve

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nBiden speech: President appeals to Americans in solemn address Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as they shook hands. Netanyahu replied: \"We do indeed.\"\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nBiden's administration said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who called the meeting \"productive and honest.\"\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza agreement were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli PM will also meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/aha\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType":

But an Israeli official said Israel's negotiating team was delayed and would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nPalestinians displaced by the Israeli military's latest order to leave parts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis say they are sleeping in the streets. The Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nRelatives of U.S. hostages call Biden-Netanyahu meeting 'productive and honest'\n\nWASHINGTON -- Relatives of U.S. hostages being held in Gaza have met with President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House, calling the discussions \"productive and honest.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterward, the family members said they \"came today with a sense of urgency\" and emphasized the need to complete a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that could result in the release of their loved ones.\n\n\"We got absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment,\" the relatives said. They added that they are more optimistic about a deal than they have been in months.\n\nPalestinians denounce Netanyahu's claims that Israel hasn't been targeting civilians\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Palestinians in the Gaza Strip expressed anger Thursday over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fiery speech to Congress, denouncing his claims that Israel was targeting Hamas, not civilians.\n\n\"We were badly shocked\" by the speech, said Im Ismail Farwanah, a woman who fled her home in northern Gaza to escape Israel's offensives. \"He has been bombarding civilians ... demolishing homes on the heads of their inhabitants.\"\n\nSeveral Palestinians who spoke to The Associated Press said they had hoped Netanyahu would announce a cease-fire.\n\nNetanyahu pledged in his combative speech to Congress on Wednesday to achieve \"total victory\" against Hamas and denounced American opponents of the war in Gaza as \"useful idiots.\" He said the Israeli military was trying to protect civilians by ordering evacuations from battleground areas and blamed Hamas for civilian deaths by operating among them.\n\nIslam Zrei, from the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, noted how Netanyahu didn't mention a truce. He said the Israeli leader wants to destroy Hamas, \"but he can't do that, so he is wiping out the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 39,000 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIran is behind an online campaign to threaten the Israeli Olympic delegation, Israel says\n\nIsraeli officials on Thursday accused Iran of orchestrating an online campaign to intimidate members of the Israeli Olympic delegation.\n\nIn a statement, Israel's National Cyber Directorate said hackers opened online channels to send threatening messages and publish private information about the delegation members who are in Paris for the 2024 Games.\n\nThe agency said it is working with the Israeli Olympic Committee and other officials to protect the members of the delegation.\n\n\"Iran is taking advantage of an apolitical international sports competition to promote digital terrorist activity against Israel and its right to participate in these competitions,\" said Gabi Portnoy, head of the national cyber directorate.\n\nNetanyahu praises Biden's 'support for the state of Israel'\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Joe Biden during made his long-awaited White House visit on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nThe president thanked Netanyahu and noted that his first meeting with an Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, was in 1973 soon after he was elected to the Senate. Biden joked that he was only 12 years old at the time.\n\nNetanyahu's first White House visit since before President Donald Trump left office in 2020, comes at a time of growing pressure on all three to find an endgame to the nine-month war that's left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nNetanyahu is also scheduled to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris later today.\n\nProtesters hold a 'die-in' near the White House\n\nProtesters against the Gaza war held a \"die-in\" across from Lafayette Park and the White House on Thursday as President Joe Biden met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe protesters poured red liquid onto the street, saying it symbolized the blood of those killed in Gaza. They chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of Netanyahu with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The jumpsuit reads, \"Wanted for crimes against humanity.\"\n\nA small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nIsraeli military has shot 3 U.N. aid convoys recently, U.N. secretary-general says\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Thursday that there's \"total lawlessness\" in Gaza, adding that three of the world body's aid convoys have come under fire within three days.\n\nThe shootings happened between Sunday and Tuesday, and bullets pierced the vehicles on two occasions, Guterres said at a news conference at U.N. headquarters.\n\n\"They were shot by the Israeli military,\" he said.\n\nThe U.N. had released information earlier this week about two of the incidents, including one Tuesday involving a convoy carrying humanitarian workers and children near the Wadi Gaza checkpoint. No one was injured.\n\nThe U.N. said Thursday that the third incident happened Sunday, but word reached headquarters later. Guterres called Gaza's humanitarian situation \"a total disaster,\" attributing it to the deadliness and destruction of Israel's military campaign and to a security vacuum.\n\n\"Nobody's in charge of security anywhere in the area of Gaza,\" Guterres said.\n\nHezbollah attacks Israeli military post, no injuries reported\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it attacked an Israeli military post in northern Israel with explosive drones after one of its members was killed earlier Thursday in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nHezbollah said that its attack directly hit the base in Neve Ziv.\n\nAfter sirens sounded in northern Israel regarding hostile aircraft infiltrations and rocket and missile launches, the Israeli military said multiple \"suspicious aerial targets\" were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory.\n\nThe army added that unsuccessful interception attempts were carried out. As a result of falling shrapnel from the interception attempts, fires broke out in several areas but no injuries were reported.\n\nIsraeli Fire and Rescue Services are operating to extinguish the fires, the army said.\n\nHezbollah said the attack with drones was in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on south Lebanon earlier in the day that killed a member of the group, Abdullah Mohammed Faqih.\n\nSince early October, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed more than 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members, but also around 90 civilians and noncombatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Khan Younis kill at least 7 Palestinians overnight\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip -- Israeli strikes on the southern city of Khan Younis killed at least seven Palestinians overnight into Thursday, according to hospital officials and an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies.\n\nAt the start of July, the Israeli military ordered parts of the city to be evacuated. On Monday, it added the Muwasi humanitarian zone and other parts of the crowded south to be evacuated. Renewed hostilities and mass displacement followed.\n\nOne strike hit the roof of a house in a neighborhood in eastern Khan Younis, killing three people who were inside. In another neighborhood, at least four others from the al-Attar family, who had previously fled from northern Gaza, were killed in a separate strike that hit their tent.\n\nThe bodies were taken to the Nasser Hospital and wrapped in blue and white bags. A group of women and girls wept after seeing the bodies at the hospital before funeral prayers. One girl said, \"Goodbye, mother,\" as she cried in the arms of a woman standing next to her.\n\nOutside the hospital, a Muslim sheikh led funeral prayers for the dead alongside a group of men. People then gathered around the bodies before they were placed on a truck and sent for burial.\n\nSince the Israel-Hamas war began, 39,175 people have been killed and 90,403 others wounded in Gaza, according to its Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry in the Palestinian enclave also said Gaza's hospitals received 30 dead bodies and 146 wounded people over the past 24 hours.\n\nHamas slams Netanyahu's speech to Congress\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian Hamas group slammed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fiery speech to the United States Congress, accusing him Thursday of obstructing efforts to end the war and return the hostages.\n\nIn his high profile visit to Washington, Netanyahu pledged to achieve \"total victory\" against the militant group in his nearly one-hour address in Congress, and derided protests against the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, now in its ninth month.\n\nHamas said Netanyahu's Washington visit was an address to improve his image after the International Criminal Court requested to issue arrest warrants against him for war crimes. The ICC also requested warrants for his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Hamas officials Mohammed Deif, Yehya Sinwar, and Ismail Haniyeh.\n\n\"He (Netanyahu) is the one who thwarted all efforts aimed at ending the war and concluding a deal to release the prisoners, despite the continuous efforts of mediators from the brothers in Egypt and Qatar despite the flexibility and positivity shown by the movement,\" the militant group said in a written statement, adding that the Israeli prime minister talking about intensified efforts to free the hostages is a \"complete lie\" to mislead public opinion.\n\nThey also rejected Netanyahu's vision for Gaza's future -- which would consist of a demilitarized civilian administration in the enclave -- and accused Netanyahu of being dishonest about aid delivery into the Gaza Strip and downplaying the number of Palestinians killed in the ongoing war.\n\n6 hostage relatives are released after being detained in Washington during Netanyahu's speech to Congress\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- A group representing the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza said Thursday that six hostage relatives have been released after they were briefly detained during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the joint session of Congress.\n\nThe family members stood in the hall silently during the address Wednesday and wore yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal Now,\" referring to a cease-fire deal to free the hostages, before they were removed from the House chamber by security officers. They were released a number of hours later, the Hostages Family Forum said.\n\n\"Benjamin Netanyahu spoke for 54 minutes and he did not mention once the need to seal the deal and to sign the deal now,\" said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin, Carmel Gat, is being held in Gaza.\n\nThe six said they were invited by members of Congress to attend the speech. Netanyahu brought to the speech rescued hostage Noa Argamani and a number of family members of the hostages as part of his official delegation.\n\nIsrael recovers 5 hostage bodies from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military said Thursday it has recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages in a tunnel under the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, that were abducted by Hamas militants on Oct. 7.\n\nIt identified the hostages as Maya Goren, and four soldiers it says died in battle: Sgt. Oren Goldin, Staff Sgt. Tomer Ahimas, Sgt. Maj. Ravid Aryeh Katz and Sgt. Kiril Brodski. It says all five were believed to have been killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas raid that triggered the war, and their bodies were held hostage.\n\nKibbutz Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities during Hamas' assault, said Wednesday that it was informed that the body of Goren, 56, was returned to Israel after a rescue mission, without providing additional details. Israeli authorities had said in late 2023 that she was dead.\n\nThe chief military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the bodies had been found in a tunnel under Khan Younis. He said the location was in an area that Israel declared in May to be part of an expanded humanitarian zone where Palestinians should take refuge. It was not known how long the bodies had been kept in the tunnel.\n\nIsrael has now pronounced dead more than a third of the roughly 110 hostages who remain in Hamas captivity.\n\nAustralia sanctions 7 Israelis and a West Bank-based youth group over settler violence\n\nSYDNEY -- Australia is imposing financial sanctions and travel bans against seven Israeli citizens and financial sanctions against a West Bank-based youth group over their alleged involvement in settler violence in the occupied territory.\n\nThe sanctions announced Thursday are against Hilltop Youth and its leader Meir Ettinger, 32. Other targeted individuals are Yinon Levi, 31; Zvi Bar Yosef, 31; Neria Ben Pazi, 30; Elisha Yered, 23; David Chai Chasdai, 29; and Einan Tanjil, 22.\n\nAustralia accuses them of violent attacks on Palestinians. These include beatings, sexual assault and torture of Palestinians resulting in serious injuries and deaths, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a statement.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government imposed the sanctions \"because it's the right thing to do.\" He added that settlements in the West Bank impeded a two-state solution and were illegal under international law.\n\nThe sanctions follow the United States' decision to sanction entities and individuals connected to acts of violence against civilians in the West Bank.\n\nWong said Australia called on Israel to hold perpetrators of settler violence to account and cease ongoing settlement activity.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"},

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as they shook hands. Netanyahu replied: \"We do indeed.\"\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nBiden's administration said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who called the meeting \"productive and honest.\"\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza agreement were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli PM will also meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/aha", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"},

Netanyahu, however, has avoided committing to a cease-fire deal and pledged to only end the war once Hamas is destroyed.\n\nNetanyahu, in the meeting, praised Biden for his years of support for Israel.\n\n\"From a proud Jew Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu said. \"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.\"\n\nIt was the first time the two leaders met face to face since Biden visited Israel shortly after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. The meeting also was Biden's first with a foreign leader since he dropped out of the presidential race and passed his campaign on to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhite House national security communications adviser John Kirby, who was in the meeting, said Biden planned to pressure Netanyahu to accept a the cease-fire deal with Hamas.\n\n\"We feel that we've got to get this hostage deal in place so we can get a cease-fire also in place,\" Kirby said at a press briefing. \"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon.\"\n\nThe two also discussed the conflict between Lebanon and Israel and countering Iran and its proxies, Kirby said.\n\nKirby said both leaders would later meet with American families of Israeli hostages.\n\nNetanyahu faces growing discontent at home over his handling of the war with Hamas. Hostage families have repeatedly called for him to accept a deal that would ensure their loved ones return home.\n\nProtests against his administration have risen since Oct. 7 and are now a daily occurrence. Top Israeli officials also slandered him in a letter to Congress saying he has prioritized his political survival over the survival of the hostages.\n\nHarris, who has been more outspoken than Biden about the Palestinians Israeli forces have killed, also was scheduled to meet with Netanyahu later Thursday.\n\nNetanyahu is scheduled to then meet with former President Donald Trump Friday at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe prime minister on Wednesday addressed a joint meeting of Congress, which Harris did not attend as she was at a previously scheduled campaign event.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers also did not attend Netanyahu's address as a sign of protest over his handling of the war.\n\nNetanyahu in his address called pro-Palestinian protesters \"Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\n\"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming, 'Gays for Gaza,'\" Netanyahu said. \"They might as well hold up signs saying, 'Chickens for KFC.' These protesters chant, 'From the river to the sea,' but many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.\"\n\nWhen asked about Netanyahu's \"useful idiots\" remark on Thursday, Kirby said it's \"not a phrase we would use.\"\n\nNetanyahu has called on the United States to continue providing support for its campaign against Hamas.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its role in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBiden in May paused a shipment of unguided bombs to Israel saying he was concerned they could be used on civilians.\n\nCongress in April passed a major foreign aid package, which included $26 billion to bolster Israel's military and provide humanitarian relief for people in Gaza.\n\nAbout $4 billion of that went to replenishing Israel's missile defense systems, and over $9 billion was earmarked toward humanitarian aid in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But the brief bonhomie masked the deep tensions between them over the war in the Gaza Strip and U.S. efforts to broker a cease-fire.\n\n\"Well, welcome back, Mr. Prime Minister,\" Biden said as the two sat down in the Oval Office. \"We've got a lot to talk about. I think we should get to it.\"\n\nThe president offered no thoughts about the situation on the ground while reporters were in the room and instead turned the floor over to Netanyahu, who used the opportunity to express gratitude now that Biden has dropped his bid for a second term and is winding up his long political career.\n\nRelated Story: Netanyahu: A Small Man in a Big Time?\n\n\"Mr. President, we've known each other for 40 years and you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years, from Golda Meir,\" Netanyahu told him. \"So from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.\"\n\nBiden grinned at the reference to him as an \"Irish American Zionist\" and then said he looked forward to their discussions as well. \"By the way, that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, and she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin,\" he said, referring to Yitzhak Rabin, who would later serve as prime minister himself. \"That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then.\"\n\nNeither man addressed their disagreements over the conduct of Israel's war against Hamas in front of cameras, nor did they give any hint of the state of negotiations over a possible cease-fire agreement that would suspend and eventually end the war in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Biden has pressed Israel and Hamas to make a deal but even as Netanyahu has said he is willing to make an agreement if certain conditions are met, he has been reluctant to end the war without ensuring that Hamas can never repeat the terrorist attack it mounted Oct. 7.\n\nRelated Story: FACT FOCUS: A Look at Netanyahu's Claims About Israel, Hamas and Iran ...\n\nJohn Kirby, a White House spokesperson, said Biden planned to press Netanyahu to make the final concessions needed to seal a cease-fire. \"We need to bring the war to an end and one of the principal things that the president is going to talk to the prime minister about today is how we get there, how do we end this war, and the best way in his view is to get this deal in place,\" Kirby said.\n\nHe said that the negotiators \"are closer now, we believe, than we've been before\" but that there were still gaps.\n\nThe meeting came a day after Netanyahu used an address to a joint meeting of Congress to denounce critics of Israel, particularly left-wing protesters he termed \"useful idiots.\" Police used pepper spray outside the Capitol to push back thousands of protesters, some of whom burned an American flag and marred statues with slogans including \"Hamas is coming.\"\n\nA day later, protesters, kept at a distance from the White House by a new wall of fencing beyond the normal gates, shouted as Netanyahu arrived Thursday. Biden and Netanyahu planned to meet with families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas after their own session.\n\nRelated Story: Netanyahu Defends War in Gaza and Denounces Protesters In Fiery Speech to ...\n\nVice President Kamala Harris planned to meet with Netanyahu separately later in the afternoon.\n\nA lot of attention will be paid to how Harris handles the meeting now that she is the putative Democratic nominee and whether she varies at all from Biden's line. Over the course of the last nine months, she has largely stuck close to the president's position, although at times she has sounded more empathetic about the suffering in Gaza, leading some to conclude that she might not be as supportive of Netanyahu's war as Biden has been.\n\nKirby acknowledged no differences between the president and vice president on Gaza. \"She's been a full partner in our policies in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nAs she sought to strike a balance, Harris even before her meeting with the prime minister condemned the \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters\" at anti-Israel demonstrations at Washington's Union Station just a few blocks from the Capitol where Netanyahu was speaking.\n\nRelated Story: Netanyahu: A Small Man in a Big Time?\n\nHedging his bets, Netanyahu planned to fly to Florida to meet Friday with former President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Trump may not offer the message the prime minister wants to hear. In an interview on Fox News on Thursday, the former president said that Israel should wrap up the war soon because it has yielded bad public relations for the country.\n\nIsrael should \"finish up and get it done quickly,\" Trump said, \"because they are getting decimated with this publicity.\"", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby.

He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nBiden speech: President appeals to Americans in solemn address 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe

On Sunday, Biden, 81, stepped aside from the U.S. presidential race under pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed Harris for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n\"We've got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said when he welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office.\n\n\"I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nThe White House was ringed with extra security fencing to protect against protesters on Thursday.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu earlier met together with the families of American hostages held by Hamas. Representatives for the families told reporters after the meeting that they were hoping for a ceasefire deal that would bring the hostages home.\n\n\"We came today with a sense of urgency,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen. He said they were more optimistic of a deal since the first release of Israeli hostages from a previous ceasefire.\n\nRelations between Biden and Netanyahu have been strained for months over Israel's Gaza offensive in which more than 39,000 people have been killed, according to health officials in Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. is a major arms supplier to Israel and has protected the country from critical United Nations votes.\n\nWhether Biden, who is now a lame-duck president, or Harris, who is tied in many election polls with Republican rival Donald Trump, can have any influence on Netanyahu remains to be seen.\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu travels to Florida to meet with Trump.\n\nHarris has been aligned with Biden on Israel but has struck a tougher tone.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people. Israel launched a retaliatory assault.\n\nHamas-led fighters took 250 captives on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu gave a defiant speech to the U.S. Congress in which he defended Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying anti-Israel protesters \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nThe Gaza conflict has splintered the Democratic Party, and sparked months of protests at Biden events. A drop in support among Arab-Americans could hurt Democratic chances in Michigan, one of a handful of states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.\n\nBiden's desire for unity in the party in the drive to defeat Trump was cited on Wednesday night in an Oval Office address as a main reason why he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race.\n\nNegotiations on a long-sought ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. officials have made similar pledges before about a ceasefire which evaporated under last-minute differences.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Daphne Psaledakis.

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as they shook hands. Netanyahu replied: \"We do indeed.\"\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nBiden's administration said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who called the meeting \"productive and honest.\"\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza agreement were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli PM will also meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/aha\n\nMore from this section\n\nHitPaw Edimakor for Mac 3.0.0 Released with AI

The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris told reporters.\n\n\"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old -- now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after Biden said at the weekend he would not stand in November's election -- said she pressed Netanyahu on the dire situation in the \"frank\" meeting.\n\nShe said she \"expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering and Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there.\"\n\n- 'Get this deal done' -\n\nHarris also called for the establishment of a Palestinian state and went on to call on both him and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal to end the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\n\"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,\" she said.\n\nHarris's outspoken comments were a stark contrast to the largely amiable greetings between Biden and Netanyahu earlier in the day, even if it masked months of tensions between the two men as well as questions over the US president's relevance.\n\n\"From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel,\" Netanyahu said in tribute to Biden at the start of the Oval Office meeting.\n\n\"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead.\"\n\nHarris has been more outspoken on Gaza in the past than Biden and there had been speculation that she could adopt a tougher approach on Israel. Officials earlier denied there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\nThe White House said Biden would tell Netanyahu there needed to be \"compromise\" for a deal, after the Israeli premier gave a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n- 'More optimistic' -\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who said they hoped for a possible new ceasefire proposal in coming days.\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on

White House national security council spokesman John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed about 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.\n\nKirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \"but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nWith Harris' forceful comments, the administration appeared to step up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the GOP presidential nominee.\n\nAhead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nHarris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech Wednesday to Congress, he derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit.

Officials deny there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as they shook hands. Netanyahu replied: \"We do indeed.\"\n\n- 'Compromise' -\n\nThe White House said Biden would keep pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, a potentially legacy-defining achievement if it happens.\n\nBiden's administration said it still believed that Netanyahu was ready for an agreement despite a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"We can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who called the meeting \"productive and honest.\"\n\nMore from this section US: Driver Dead In Tractor-Trailer Explosion, Causing Road Closures In Clifton, NJ 2 City of Winnipeg seeks buyer for Osborne Village lot Ukraine downs Russian aircraft as Kremlin's casualties mount\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nHarris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\n- 'Final gaps' -\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.\n\nA senior US administration official said Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza agreement were in the \"closing stages\" and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nIn a primetime speech on Wednesday explaining his decision to bow out of the election, Biden said he would \"keep working to end the war on Gaza.\"\n\nBut in a further sign of Biden's diminishing relevance, and Netanyahu's determination to play both sides, the Israeli PM will also meet Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe ex-president on Thursday urged Israel to quickly \"finish up\" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nMore than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/aha", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nBy Steve Holland and Jeff Mason\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris sharply pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday about the humanitarian situation in Gaza in \"frank\" talks that were watched for signs of how she might shift American policy about Israel if she becomes president.\n\n\"Israel has a right to defend itself. And how it does so matters,\" Harris told reporters after the meeting. She said she raised her serious concerns about the scale of human suffering in Gaza.\n\n\"I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there,\" she said. \"I will not be silent.\"\n\nHarris' remarks, which were sharp and serious in tone, reflected what could be a shift from President Joe Biden in how she deals with Netanyahu.\n\nHours earlier, Biden pressed for a ceasefire to the 9-month-old war in Gaza in his first face-to-face talks with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel days after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and pledged American support.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby said gaps remain between Israel and the Hamas militants who run the Palestinian enclave in the drive for a ceasefire but \"we are closer now than we've been before.\"\n\n\"Both sides have to make compromises,\" Kirby said.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matt Miller said: \"I think the message from the American side in that meeting will be that we need to get this deal over the line.\"\n\nThe visit coincides with a shift in American politics. On Sunday, Biden, 81, stepped aside from the U.S. presidential race under pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed Harris for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n\"We've got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said when he welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office.\n\n\"I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nThe White House was ringed with extra security fencing to protect against protesters on Thursday.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu earlier met together with the families of American hostages held by Hamas. Representatives for the families told reporters after the meeting that they were hoping for a ceasefire deal that would bring the hostages home.\n\n\"We came today with a sense of urgency,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen. He said they were more optimistic of a deal since the first release of Israeli hostages from a previous ceasefire.\n\nSTRAINS IN BIDEN-NETANYAHU RELATIONS\n\nRelations between Biden and Netanyahu have been strained for months over Israel's Gaza offensive in which more than 39,000 people have been killed, according to health officials in Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. is a major arms supplier to Israel and has protected the country from critical United Nations votes.\n\nWhether Biden, who is now a \"lame duck\" president, a term used for officials who won't serve another term, or Harris, who is tied in many election polls with Republican rival Donald Trump, can have any influence on Netanyahu remains to be seen.\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu travels to Florida to meet Trump.\n\nHarris has been aligned with Biden on Israel but has struck a tougher tone.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people. Israel launched a retaliatory assault.\n\nHamas-led fighters took 250 captives on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.\n\nDEFIANT SPEECH\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu gave a defiant speech to the U.S. Congress in which he defended Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying anti-Israel protesters \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nThe Gaza conflict has splintered the Democratic Party, and sparked months of protests at Biden events. A drop in support among Arab-Americans could hurt Democratic chances in Michigan, one of a handful of states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.\n\nBiden's desire for unity in the party in the drive to defeat Trump was cited on Wednesday night in an Oval Office address as a main reason why he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race.\n\nNegotiations on a long-sought ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. officials have made similar pledges before about a ceasefire which evaporated under last-minute differences.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Daphne Psaledakis.

and that Biden had known every Israeli PM over the last half a century.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Biden \"on the great issues before us\" over the next several months.\n\nThe US president joked that Golda Meir was the first Israeli PM that Biden had met, and that Yitzhak Rabin, a successor, was there as an assistant.\n\nThe meeting follows months of tension over the war in Gaza, with Biden reaching the point in May, according to his friend and former defence secretary Chuck Hagel, where he said \"enough is enough\".\n\nBiden also previously publicly threatened to hold back weapons shipments if Israel launched a large-scale ground offensive in Rafah, prompting anger in Israel.\n\nNetanyahu said in June it was \"inconceivable\" for the Biden administration to withhold weapons and ammunition from Israel.\n\nAt a news briefing, national security spokesman John Kirby said the pair discussed the urgent need for a hostage release deal, the potential of conflict spilling over into Lebanon, the threat of Iran and the need to reach \"compromises\" in peace talks.\n\nWhile Kirby added that \"gaps remain\" in the US-Israel relationship, it was still \"healthy\".\n\n\"By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything,\" Kirby said, adding that Biden was \"very comfortable with the relationship he has with the prime minister\".\n\nNetanyahu also met Vice-President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee now that Biden has stepped down from his re-election campaign.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Harris called the discussion \"frank and constructive\", adding that she has an \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel and its right to defend itself.\n\nShe added, however, that she had \"serious concerns\" about Israeli operations in Gaza and the \"dire humanitarian situation there\".\n\n\"I will not be silent,\" she added. \"It is time for this war to end.\"\n\n\"Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war,\" she said. \"Let's bring the hostages home, and let's bring much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.\"\n\nShe added that the war in Gaza is \"not a binary conversation\" and encouraged Americans to understand the \"history and nuance\" of the conflict.\n\nThe US and Israeli leaders also held a closed-door meeting with the families of seven US citizens still being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Jonathan Dekel-Chen - whose son Sagui was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October - told reporters that the meeting was \"productive and honest\", although he did not provide details.\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in the House chamber on Wednesday, Netanyahu defended Israel's war in Gaza, while attempting to rally support from US politicians.\n\n\"Our enemies are your enemies,\" he said, condemning protesters as \"Iran's useful idiots\".\n\nThe White House pushed back on Mr Netanyahu's characterisation of the protesters, with Kirby saying that \"it's not a phrase we would use\" and \"not a reflection of what we think\" of the \"mostly peaceful\" protests.\n\nThousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of Washington to accuse Netanyahu of being a \"war criminal\".\n\nTheir loudspeakers and chanting could be clearly heard from the White House as Netanyahu arrived on Thursday.\n\nPolice arrested 23 people on Wednesday, including five inside the Capitol building.\n\nNetanyahu's speech was occasionally met with rapturous applause, mostly led by Republicans.\n\nThe Gaza war has deepened political divides in Washington, and led to infighting among Democrats, whose left wing has been critical of US support of Israel.\n\nCongresswoman Rashida Tlaib was spotted sitting in the audience holding a sign that read \"guilty of genocide\".\n\nHarris did not attend Netanyahu's speech due to scheduling conflicts, the White House said.\n\nInstead, she spent part of the day speaking to a crowd from the historically black sorority Zeta Phi Beta.\n\nHarris has expressed steadfast support for Israel. However, such a stance has been politically costly for the Democrats.\n\nHundreds of thousands of protest votes were cast against Biden during the presidential primaries by those wanting him to stop sending military aid to Israel.\n\nSome of those angered by his war stance see Harris as a chance to mend the fracture in the party, and win back the votes.\n\nNetanyahu is expected to visit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on Friday (local time).", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [],

Ripping up outgoing President Joe Biden's playbook of mostly behind-the-scenes pressure on Israel, the vice president said after meeting Netanyahu that it was time to end the \"devastating\" war.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris told reporters. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old - now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after Biden said at the weekend he would not stand in November's election - said she pressed Netanyahu on the dire situation in the \"frank\" meeting. She said she \"expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering and Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians.\" \"And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there.\"\n\nHarris also called for the establishment of a Palestinian state and went on to call on both him and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal to end the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. \"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,\" she said.\n\nHarris's outspoken comments were a stark contrast to the largely amiable greetings between Biden and Netanyahu earlier in the day, even if it masked months of tensions between the two men as well as questions over the US president's relevance. \"From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel,\" Netanyahu said in tribute to Biden at the start of the Oval Office meeting. \"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead.\"\n\nThe White House said Biden would tell Netanyahu there needed to be \"compromise\" for a deal after the Israeli premier gave a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas. \"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who said they hoped for a possible new ceasefire proposal in the coming days. \"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [],

He said the first phase of the deal includes a six-week cease-fire and the release of the most vulnerable hostages.\n\n\"We are close, we just have to finish it,\" he said.\n\nThe meeting comes a day after Netanyahu urged Congress in an address to both the House and Seante to continue to stand with Israel in the war against Hamas.\n\nIt's Mr. Biden's first with a foreign leader since he exited the race for the presidency Sunday and threw his support to Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination.\n\nMr. Biden welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office, where the prime minister thanked the president for his decades of service.\n\n\"I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nMr. Biden said he was also looking forward to it.\n\nHarris will be meeting with Netanyahu separately later Thursday, the White House said.\n\nThe vice president did not attend Netanyahu's speech, citing previously scheduled travel. She was in Texas Thursday morning, addressing the American Federation of Teachers. A number of Democrats in Congress declined to attend Netanyahu's congressional address, a gesture of disapproval toward Netanyahu's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAs Netanyahu spoke, pro-Palestinian protesters swarmed Union Station near the Capitol. Protesters removed the American flags that fly over Union Station, replacing them with Palestinian flags.\n\nIn his address to Congress, Netanyahu attacked pro-Palestinian protesters in the U.S., calling them \"Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\n\"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming, 'Gays for Gaza,'\" Netanyahu said. \"They might as well hold up signs saying, 'Chickens for KFC.' These protesters chant, 'From the river to the sea,' but many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.\"\n\nResponding to the \"useful idiots\" remark, Kirby said it's \"not a phrase we would use.\"\n\nNetanyahu is facing growing backlash at home over his handling of the war with Hamas. The families of hostages held in Gaza have been calling on Netanyahu to make a deal to bring back their loved ones. There have been daily protests in Jerusalem, and a group of top former Israeli security and political officials also sent a blistering letter to U.S. congressional leaders this week, accusing Netanyahu of prioritizing his own political survival over that of the hostages, Israel's security, as well as the region.\n\nMr. Biden and Netanyahu will also discuss the conflict between Lebanon and Israel, the need for stability in the West Bank and countering Iran and its proxy groups, Kirby said.\n\nThe two leaders will then meet with the families of Americans held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Administration officials regularly meet with this particular group of families, a senior administration official told reporters.\n\nThis will be the first time Mr. Biden and Netanyahu will be seeing

The meeting was the first time Biden hosted Israel's prime minister in the White House since Netanyahu was reelected in 2022.\n\nThe two leaders will also meet with families of American hostages held captive in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nRelations between the two leaders have grown tense in recent years after Biden opposed Israeli judicial reform and held up weapon shipments with aerial bombs for the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nAfter Iran attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles and bombs in April, Biden told Netanyahu he would not support a counterattack. Instead, Biden praised the successful interception of most projectiles as a \"win\" and warned against escalation.\n\nNetanyahu was originally scheduled to meet with Biden on Tuesday but the meeting was delayed due to the president's COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nNetanyahu praised Biden during his joint-address to Congress on Wednesday, thanking him for condemning Hamas after October 7, sending two aircraft carriers, and calling himself a \"proud Irish-American Zionist.\"\n\n\"He came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour -- a visit that will never be forgotten,\" Netanyahu said. \"President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Netanyahu requested the United States speed up weapons shipments to help them defeat Hamas quicker and proposed creating an \"Abraham Alliance\" between Israel and Arab states to combat Iran and its proxies.\n\nOutside the speech blocks away, anti-Israel and anti-American protesters lowered American flags from the poles outside Union Station, burnt them while shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" and \"burn that sh**.\" The flags were replaced with Palestinian flags until several House Republicans restored Old Glory on the poles Wednesday night.\n\nNetanyahu is scheduled to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris Thursday afternoon at 4:30 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

an endgame to the nine-month war that has left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza.\n\nDozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nMr Biden greeted Mr Netanyahu in the Oval Office, where the Israeli leader thanked the president for his service.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Mr Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Mr Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years.\n\nMr Netanyahu, in what could be his last White House meeting with Mr Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they have known each other.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Mr Netanyahu told Mr Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nMr Biden thanked Mr Netanyahu and joked that his first meeting with an Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, in 1973 soon after he was elected to the Senate came when he was only 12.\n\nMr Biden is pressing to get Israel and Hamas to seal a US-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases -- something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for the 81-year-old Democrat, who abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed Ms Harris.\n\nIt could also be a boon for Ms Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nWhite House officials say that the negotiations are in the closing stages but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nFollowing their midday talks, Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu will meet the families of American hostages.\n\nMs Harris, who will meet separately with Mr Netanyahu later, is trying to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief.\n\nShe is being scrutinised by those on the political left who say Mr Biden has not done enough to force Mr Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nMr Netanyahu, in a fiery address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, offered a robust defence of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East\".\n\nThe Israeli leader spent scant time discussing the ongoing negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "andoveradvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andover Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu",

The meeting was the first time Biden hosted Israel's prime minister in the White House since Netanyahu was reelected in 2022.\n\nThe two leaders will also meet with families of American hostages held captive in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nRelations between the two leaders have grown tense in recent years after Biden opposed Israeli judicial reform and held up weapon shipments with aerial bombs for the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nAfter Iran attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles and bombs in April, Biden told Netanyahu he would not support a counterattack. Instead, Biden praised the successful interception of most projectiles as a \"win\" and warned against escalation.\n\nNetanyahu was originally scheduled to meet with Biden on Tuesday but the meeting was delayed due to the president's COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nNetanyahu praised Biden during his joint-address to Congress on Wednesday, thanking him for condemning Hamas after October 7, sending two aircraft carriers, and calling himself a \"proud Irish-American Zionist.\"\n\n\"He came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour -- a visit that will never be forgotten,\" Netanyahu said. \"President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Netanyahu requested the United States speed up weapons shipments to help them defeat Hamas quicker and proposed creating an \"Abraham Alliance\" between Israel and Arab states to combat Iran and its proxies.\n\nOutside the speech blocks away, anti-Israel and anti-American protesters lowered American flags from the poles outside Union Station, burnt them while shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" and \"burn that sh**.\" The flags were replaced with Palestinian flags until several House Republicans restored Old Glory on the poles Wednesday night.\n\nNetanyahu is scheduled to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris Thursday afternoon at 4:30 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news",

Facing mounting pressure to end the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict, now in its ninth month, Netanyahu emphasized his long-standing relationship with Biden, noting that the president has known every Israeli Prime Minister over the past 50 years.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu expressed his eagerness to collaborate with Biden on the major issues facing them in the coming months. Biden, in turn, quipped that he had first met Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and had Yitzhak Rabin as an assistant during that period.\n\nTheir meeting comes amid ongoing strain over the Gaza conflict. In May, according to former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Biden reached a breaking point, stating \"enough is enough.\" Biden had previously threatened to restrict weapons shipments if Israel carried out a large-scale ground offensive in Rafah, which provoked a strong reaction from Israel. In response, Netanyahu described the idea of the Biden administration withholding weapons and ammunition from Israel as \"inconceivable.\"\n\nMr. Netanyahu also expressed his anticipation of collaborating with Mr. Biden \"on the great issues before us\" in the coming months.\n\nThe US president humorously noted that Golda Meir was the first Israeli Prime Minister he had met, and Yitzhak Rabin, her successor, was present as an assistant.\n\nTheir meeting comes after months of friction over the Gaza conflict. According to Chuck Hagel, a former defense secretary and friend of Biden, the president reached a critical point in May, declaring \"enough is enough.\"\n\nBiden had previously threatened to halt weapons shipments if Israel conducted a major ground offensive in Rafah, which caused significant backlash in Israel. In June, Mr. Netanyahu described it as \"inconceivable\" for the Biden administration \"to withhold weapons and ammunition from Israel.\"\n\nDuring a news briefing, national security spokesperson John Kirby stated that Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu addressed several critical issues, including the urgent need for a deal on releasing hostages, the risk of the conflict spreading into Lebanon, the threat posed by Iran, and the necessity of reaching \"compromises\" in peace negotiations.\n\nREAD MORE: Obama Set To Endorse Harris As Democrats Gear Up For Nomination Process\n\nKirby also mentioned that while \"gaps remain\" in the US-Israel relationship, the two countries maintain a \"healthy relationship.\"\n\n\"By healthy, I mean they won't agree on every issue,\" Mr. Kirby explained, noting that Mr. Biden was \"very comfortable with the relationship he has with the prime minister.\"\n\nThe US and Israeli leaders also conducted a private session with the families of seven American citizens who remain hostage in Gaza, held by Hamas. Following the meeting, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was abducted from Kibbutz Near Oz on October 7, described the meeting as \"productive and honest,\" though he refrained from sharing specifics.\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,\" he said.\n\nMr. Netanyahu also had a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is expected to be the Democratic nominee following President Biden's announcement of his withdrawal from the re-election race. During his speech in the House chamber on Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu defended Israel's actions in Gaza while seeking to garner support from US legislators.\n\n\"Our enemies are your enemies,\" Mr. Netanyahu stated, labeling protesters as \"Iran's useful idiots.\" The White House rebutted Mr. Netanyahu's comments, with spokesperson John Kirby clarifying that \"it's not a phrase we would use\" and does not reflect their view of the \"mostly peaceful\" demonstrations. Thousands of pro-Palestinian activists had gathered in Washington, accusing Mr. Netanyahu of being a \"war criminal.\"\n\nTheir loudspeakers and chants were clearly audible from the White House as Mr. Netanyahu arrived on Thursday. Police arrested 23 individuals, including five inside the Capitol building.\n\nDuring Mr. Netanyahu's speech, he received enthusiastic applause from Republicans, although the address highlighted the growing political divide in Washington over the Gaza conflict. The war has intensified rifts within the Democratic Party, with its progressive members vocally criticizing U.S. support for Israel.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris did not attend Mr. Netanyahu's speech due to scheduling conflicts, the White House reported. Instead, she engaged with a crowd from the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta. While Ms. Harris has shown strong support for Israel, this position has proven politically challenging for the Democrats.\n\nHundreds of thousands of protest votes were cast against Mr. Biden during the presidential primaries by those demanding an end to military aid to Israel. Among those dissatisfied with his stance on the war, some view Ms. Harris as a potential means to heal the rift within the party and regain support.\n\nMr. Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Friday.\n\n(Includes inputs from online sources)", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"},

The White House says the remaining disagreements over a multi-phase cease-fire deal could be resolved within a week.\n\nThe deal would put in place a 42-day pause in fighting and require Hamas to release, in phases, the estimated 115 hostages - alive and dead - with Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, and a scale up of delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The deal calls for a second round of negotiations to take place half-way through the truce, to broker a permanent end to the war, the transition to a Palestinian civilian administration of Gaza and reconstruction.\n\n\"We got an absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now, to waste no time and to complete this deal, as it currently stands, with as little change as humanly possible,\" Dekel-Chen told reporters, standing with other families outside the White House.\n\n\"We are also very happy to hear from the president that Hamas now understands that the ball is now in its court. World pressure is such that it has nowhere to hide anymore.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu met for about 90 minutes before the families were brought in. Netanyahu is also holding separate meetings with Vice President Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, and former President Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\nJonathan Polin, who's son Hersch Goldberg-Polin is held hostage, said the meetings conveyed a consensus on getting the cease-fire deal done immediately. Trump, in an interview on Fox News on Thursday, said he wants Netanyahu to \"finish up\" the war and \"get the hostages back.\"\n\n\"We've got a rare moment now where the current president of the United States and anybody who might become president of the United States, both vice President Harris and Donald Trump, are all aligned saying this deal must get done now,\" Polin said.\n\n\"So anybody, on any side who makes the mistaken political calculus that there's benefit in waiting, will find out that that logic is wrong. The deal must happen now.\"\n\nHarris, in remarks following her meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday, said she had a \"frank and constructive\" talk with the Israeli leader, adding that she told him its time to get a ceasefire done now.\n\nHarris's remarks offered the clearest indication yet on how she will approach U.S. policy toward Israel and the Palestinians, an issue that have divided the Democratic party over criticisms that the Biden administration has held back consequences on Israel for violations of international humanitarian law.\n\n\"I've said it many times but it bears repeating, Israel has a right to defend itself, but how it does so matters,\" Harris said, adding that she brought up with Netanyahu \"the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians.\"\n\nThe meetings with Netanyahu came a day after the Israeli leader gave a controversial speech to a joint session of Congress that was boycotted by scores of Democrats, protested by hostage families, and marked by angry protests outside the Capitol against the Israeli leader who they view as a war criminal and an obstacle to peace.\n\nThe White House on Thursday pushed back against those characterizations, with White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby saying the administration does not agree with allegations made by the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court that Netanyahu is a war criminal.\n\n\"We don't consider him a war criminal... we don't find the ICC's finding to be relevant or appropriate in this case. We don't find him to be a war criminal. He's an ally and a partner and a friend.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_kelly@thehill.com", "name": "Laura Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint session of the United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/hostagefamilies_072524_AP.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 550, "textEnd": 556, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris told reporters.\n\n\"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after Biden said at the weekend he would not stand in November's election said she pressed Netanyahu on the dire situation in the \"frank\" meeting.\n\nShe said she \"expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering and Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there.\"\n\nHarris also called for the establishment of a Palestinian state and went on to call on both him and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal to end the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\n\"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,\" she said.\n\nHarris's outspoken comments were a stark contrast to the largely amiable greetings between Biden and Netanyahu earlier in the day, even if it masked months of tensions between the two men as well as questions over the US president's relevance.\n\n\"From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel,\" Netanyahu said in tribute to Biden at the start of the Oval Office meeting.\n\n\"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead.\"\n\nHarris has been more outspoken on Gaza in the past than Biden and there had been speculation that she could adopt a tougher approach on Israel. Officials earlier denied there is any \"daylight\" between her and Biden.\n\nThe White House said Biden would tell Netanyahu there needed to be \"compromise\" for a deal, after the Israeli premier gave a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\n\"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who said they hoped for a possible new ceasefire proposal in coming days.\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.\n\nProtesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.\n\nWhile Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 39,175 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.\n\ndk/acb", "source": {"uri":

REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nBy Steve Holland and Jeff Mason\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday at a White House meeting that was closely watched for signs of how she might shift American policy about Israel if she becomes president.\n\nHours earlier, President Joe Biden pressed for a ceasefire to the 9-month-old war in Gaza in his first face-to-face talks with Netanyahu since the president traveled to Israel days after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and pledged American support.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said in greeting Netanyahu, echoing Biden almost word-for-word when he met the Israeli leader separately earlier in the day.\n\n\"We do indeed,\" Netanyahu told her.\n\nOne of the first high profile U.S. leaders to call for a ceasefire, Harris was expected to closely track the administration line, a U.S. official said, focusing on the plight of Palestinians while also supporting Israel's right to self-defense.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby said gaps remain between Israel and the Hamas militants who run the Palestinian enclave in the drive for a ceasefire but \"we are closer now than we've been before.\"\n\n\"Both sides have to make compromises,\" Kirby said.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matt Miller said: \"I think the message from the American side in that meeting will be that we need to get this deal over the line.\"\n\nThe visit coincides with a shift in American politics. On Sunday, Biden, 81, stepped aside from the U.S. presidential race under pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed Harris for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n\"We've got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said when he welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office.\n\n\"I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nThe White House was ringed with extra security fencing to protect against protesters on Thursday.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu earlier met together with the families of American hostages held by Hamas. Representatives for the families told reporters after the meeting that they were hoping for a ceasefire deal that would bring the hostages home.\n\n\"We came today with a sense of urgency,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen. He said they were more optimistic of a deal since the first release of Israeli hostages from a previous ceasefire.\n\nSTRAINS IN BIDEN-NETANYAHU RELATIONS\n\nRelations between Biden and Netanyahu have been strained for months over Israel's Gaza offensive in which more than 39,000 people have been killed, according to health officials in Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. is a major arms supplier to Israel and has protected the country from critical United Nations votes.\n\nWhether Biden, who is now a \"lame duck\" president, a term used for officials who won't serve another term, or Harris, who is tied in many election polls with Republican rival Donald Trump, can have any influence on Netanyahu remains to be seen.\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu travels to Florida to meet Trump.\n\nHarris has been aligned with Biden on Israel but has struck a tougher tone.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people. Israel launched a retaliatory assault.\n\nHamas-led fighters took 250 captives on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.\n\nDEFIANT SPEECH\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu gave a defiant speech to the U.S. Congress in which he defended Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying anti-Israel protesters \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nThe Gaza conflict has splintered the Democratic Party, and sparked months of protests at Biden events. A drop in support among Arab-Americans could hurt Democratic chances in Michigan, one of a handful of states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.\n\nBiden's desire for unity in the party in the drive to defeat Trump was cited on Wednesday night in an Oval Office address as a main reason why he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race.\n\nNegotiations on a long-sought ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. officials have made similar pledges before about a ceasefire which evaporated under last-minute differences.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Daphne Psaledakis.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nBiden reiterated in their Oval Office meeting his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He added, \"But it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nHarris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. \"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her support for Israel as insufficient.\n\nA senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration's support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran's aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris said Thursday she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu's address to Congress. White House officials said that her absence wasn't a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015.\n\nBiden speech: President appeals to Americans in solemn address Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

On Sunday, Biden stepped aside from the U.S. presidential race under pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed Kamala Harris for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n\"We've got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said when he welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office.\n\n\"I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden, citing the president's half-century of public service.\n\nIn the late afternoon, Harris met the Israeli leader in her ceremonial office at the White House.\n\nThe meeting was closely watched for signs of how Harris, who was the first top U.S. official to call for a cease-fire, could shift U.S. policy toward Israel if she becomes president.\n\nHarris was expected to closely track the administration line in the meeting, a U.S. official said, focusing on the plight of Palestinians while also supporting Israel's right to self-defense.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nA senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on Israel.

He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nThe U.S. is a major arms supplier to Israel and has protected the country from critical United Nations votes.\n\nNetanyahu's visit, his first to Israel's most important international ally since returning for a record sixth term as prime minister at the end of 2022, comes on the heels of Biden's dramatic decision not to seek reelection.\n\nWhether Biden, who is now a \"lame duck\" president, a term used for officials who won't serve another term, or Harris, who is tied in many election polls with Republican Donald Trump, can have any influence on Netanyahu remains to be seen.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris are eager for a cease-fire. Harris has been aligned with Biden on Israel but has struck a tougher tone.\n\nThe White House was ringed with extra security fencing to protect against protesters on Thursday.\n\nNegotiations on a long-sought ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.\n\nThe official, briefing reporters ahead of the talks, said the remaining obstacles are bridgeable and there will be more meetings aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas over the next week.\n\nU.S. officials have made similar pledges before about a cease-fire which evaporated under last-minute differences. Netanyahu says Israel will continue to carry out attacks to remove Hamas from Gaza even if they reach a cease-fire.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu gave a defiant speech to the U.S. Congress in which he defended Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying anti-Israel protesters \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nHe claimed that Israel's genocidal war on Gaza has \"one of the lowest ratios of combatants to non-combatant casualties in the history of urban warfare.\"\n\nThe claim is far from the truth in Gaza, where the confirmed Palestinian death toll sits at nearly 40,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nIt has repeatedly publicized lists of the dead, including their Israeli-issued identification numbers, and whose data from past conflicts the U.N. has attested as reliable.\n\nThe majority of the dead have been women and children and not every man killed has been a combatant.\n\nIsrael has largely shrugged off civilian casualties, blaming Hamas as the number has risen dramatically over the past nine months.\n\nThe true death toll is likely far higher than the official numbers from the ministry, a fact even the Biden administration has acknowledged.\n\nMany of the dead likely remain buried under Gaza's sprawling rubble fields or were summarily buried at makeshift sites by Israeli forces.\n\nMeanwhile, more protests took place near the White House as Biden and Netanyahu met.\n\nThe protesters chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of Netanyahu with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit.\n\nThe jumpsuit reads, \"Wanted for crimes against humanity.\"\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu travels to Florida to meet Trump.\n\nThe Gaza conflict has splintered the Democratic Party and sparked months of protests at Biden events. A drop in support among Arab-Americans could hurt Democratic chances in Michigan, one of a handful of states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.\n\nBiden's desire for unity in the party in the drive to defeat Trump was cited on Wednesday night in an Oval Office address as the main reason why he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race.", "source": {"uri":

The two leaders discussed the latest developments in Gaza, including the humanitarian crisis and efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist group.\n\nThey appeared briefly together for a statement to the press and did not take any questions from reporters.\n\n\"Mr. President, we have known each other for 40 years, and you've known every prime minister for 50 years, from Golda Meir. From a proud Jewish Zionist, to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Mr. Netanyahu said.\"I look forward to it as well,\" Mr. Biden said.\n\nThe two leaders will later meet in the White House Cabinet Room with families of Americans still being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.\n\nDuring his joint session of Congress just the day before, Mr. Netanyahu thanked President Biden for visiting Israel shortly after Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, surprise attack on Israel and his ongoing support.\n\n\"I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on Oct. 7,\" Mr. Netanyahu said during a joint session of Congress the day prior. \"He rightly called Hamas 'sheer evil.' He dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Middle East to deter a wider war. And he came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour -- a visit that will never be forgotten.\"\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters gathered near the Capitol during the prime minister's speech. The demonstrators removed American flags that were flying above Union Station and replaced them with Palestinian flags.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris publicly condemned the violence and called it \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-filled rhetoric\" in a post on X.\n\nMs. Harris, who missed Mr. Netanyahu's speech due to a previously scheduled event in Indianapolis, will meet with him separately on Thursday afternoon in the vice president's ceremonial office.\n\nMr. Netanyahu is also expected to meet with the Republican presidential nominee, former President

White House national security council spokesman John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed about 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.\n\nKirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \"but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nWith Harris' forceful comments, the administration appeared to step up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when Republican Donald Trump was president, will head to Florida on Friday to meet with the GOP presidential nominee.\n\nAhead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nHarris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech Wednesday to Congress, he derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\nBiden speech: President appeals to Americans in solemn address 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe

The prime minister is also expected to talk to Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for the 2024 general election, in the afternoon.\n\nBefore entering their closed meeting, Netanyahu thanked Biden for \"50 years of support for Israel.\"\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden has been pushing for a proposal that could end the fighting and release the remaining hostages being held by Hamas over three phases.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House National Security Communications adviser, said that a lot was on the agenda for Netanyahu and Biden to discuss at an afternoon press briefing, including this deal.\n\n\"There are gaps that remain and our team continues to work with our counterparts in the region to see if we can't close those gaps,\" Kirby said. \"We believe that they are of a nature where they can be closed and then we can achieve a deal.\"\n\nWhile there is still work to do, Kirby said, \"we are closer now than we've been before.\"\n\n\"We think it's absolutely achievable to get this over the finish line,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nAfter their conversation, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of some of the people taken hostage by Hamas.\n\nFamily members at the White House expressed optimism, saying that they were \"happy to hear from the President that Hamas knows the ball is in their court.\" All those present were in favor of an truce over the Olympics, which take place in Paris, France this year.\n\nNetanyahu's meetings with Biden and Harris come a day after his address at a joint meeting of Congress amid a war that's left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza, according to the Associated Press. Israel's military offensive there started after Hamas militants, on Oct. 7, stormed the southern part of the country, killing more than 1,200 people and abducting 250.\n\nMore than 60 Democrats, as well as independent Rep. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, did not attend Netanyahu's speech as a boycott of the prime minister's actions during the war. Harris was also not at the speech, though said it was because of a long-scheduled trip. Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, was also not present for Netanyahu's remarks, saying he needed to campaign.\n\nNetanyahu faces much criticism, both domestically and internationally, for the thousands of Palestinian deaths from Israeli bombardment, as well as the humanitarian crisis facing Gaza. A recent report from the leading international authority on hunger crises states that nearly everyone in Gaza is struggling to get enough food. More than 495,000 people, or greater than a fifth of the population of 2.3 million, are expected to experience the highest level of starvation in the coming months, the report said.\n\nThe International Criminal Court, which isn't recognized by the United States, issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over what they allege are war crimes committed by Israel.\n\nIsraeli government officials and Netanyahu deny war crimes accusations, with the latter saying that \"Israel will always defend itself\" in his Wednesday speech.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" Netanyahu said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nPro-Palestinian advocates protested outside the Capitol as Netanyahu spoke, demanding a cease-fire and calling what's happening in Gaza a genocide. Some hostages taken by Hamas who were later freed, and families of those still in captivity, also took issue with Netanyahu's speech, with five of them rising to display T-shirts with slogans demanding an end to the war. They said in a statement they were \"profoundly disappointed\" by Netanyahu's speech, as he \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table.\"\n\nAs the presumptive Democratic nominee for president following Biden dropping out of the 2024 race, there's been more attention placed on Harris' stances on Gaza.\n\nHarris has been more outspoken about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza during the conflict -- and used the words \"immediate ceasefire\" before Biden did.\n\n\"People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane and our common humanity compels us to act,\" Harris said at a March event to commemorate the 59th anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday\" in Alabama. \"The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses.\"\n\nStill, she released a statement Thursday morning condemning the previous day's demonstrations, calling some protestors \"unpatriotic.\"\n\n\"I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews,\" Harris said, adding that the \"pro-Hamas\" graffiti reportedly seen was \"abhorrent.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Kirby referred questions on how Harris' administration would approach the situation in Gaza to her campaign, but said the vice president has been a \"full partner\" in Biden's policies in the Middle East, especially those on Israel.\n\n\"(Harris has) been involved in nearly every conversation the president has had with the prime minister,\" Kirby said.", "source": {"uri":

So from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel, and I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nBiden replied that he looked forward to working with the Israeli leader over his final six months in office, and noted that his first meeting with an Israeli leader -- then-prime minister Golda Meir -- also included Yitzhak Rabin, then an assistant to Meir.\n\nRabin, who served as Israel's head of government from 1974-1977 and regained the prime minister's post in 1992, was the Israeli leader who signed the landmark peace deal that brought the Palestinian Authority into existence and laid out a roadmap for peace that has largely been ignored by Netanyahu. He was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli right-wing extremist who was opposed to the peace process.\n\nThe relatively civil sit-down between the two leaders came the day after Netanyahu addressed Congress with a thundering and often bellicose set of remarks in which he condemned pro-Palestinian protesters as \"useful idiots\" who serve the interests of the Iranian government.\n\nAs he spoke in the House of Representatives' cavernous chamber, just blocks away protesters clashed with police officers and defaced monuments near Washington, DC's main train station. Some burned American flags and replaced them with Palestinian one.\n\nThe violence was widely condemned by both Biden and Harris, who in a statement on Thursday denounced the \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric\" and condemned \"any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas.\"\n\nThe meeting between Biden and Netanyahu also took place less than 24 hours after Biden delivered a televised speech explaining his decision to stand down from seeking re-election and endorse Harris -- who is set to meet with Netanyahu later in the day.\n\nBiden has spent months unsuccessfully attempting to pressure Netanyahu into moderating his approach to his nearly year-old war on Hamas in hopes of bringing about a deal to return the more than 100 hostages who are still being held by the militant group. Both he and Netanyahu were set to meet with American families of hostages still in captivity later on Thursday.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister's visit comes after months of pressure from Democratic activists who've been angered by Biden's continued support for Netanyahu's war against Hamas in the wake of the October 7 terror attacks. While the president has put a hold on a shipment of heavy bombs which can cause significant casualties when used in heavily-populated areas, the US continues to be Israel's largest supplier of military materials.\n\nMembers of Biden's own party have urged him to break more forcefully with Netanyahu, citing the Israeli leader's longstanding habit of snubbing Democratic presidents and interfering in American politics in favor of Republicans, who have largely given him a free hand to do what he pleases when it comes to the Palestinians.\n\nYet White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby told reporters the relationship between the two leaders was a \"healthy\" one despite the tensions.\n\n\"By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything. They haven't, through the long political lives that both of them have have enjoyed, always agreed on everything. They come from two different political traditions, but they know one another,\" he said.\n\nKirby added that he believes Biden is \"very comfortable\" in his relationship with Netanyahu and \"the ability that he has to be candid and honest and lay it all out there\" in talks with the Israeli leader.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

This marks a departure from the approach of outgoing President Joe Biden, who largely exercised behind-the-scenes pressure on Israel.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after her meeting with Netanyahu, Harris condemned the ongoing conflict, saying, \"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating.The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.\"\n\nHarris, who assumed the Democratic presidential nomination after Biden announced he would not seek re-election, emphasized the urgency of addressing the humanitarian crisis during her \"frank\" discussion with Netanyahu. \"I expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there.\"\n\nIn addition to calling for a Palestinian state, Harris urged both Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and release hostages to end the conflict, which began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. \"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,\" she asserted.\n\nHarris's forthright stance contrasts sharply with the earlier amicable exchange between Biden and Netanyahu, despite underlying tensions and questions about Biden's influence. Netanyahu praised Biden, saying, \"From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead.\"\n\nWhile Harris has previously been more vocal about Gaza than Biden, White House officials maintain there is no significant policy divergence between them. The White House stated that Biden would emphasize the need for \"compromise\" in a deal, following Netanyahu's assertive speech to the US Congress.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu also met with families of US hostages held in Gaza, who expressed cautious optimism about a potential new ceasefire proposal. \"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen.\n\nProtests erupted outside the White House, echoing the demonstrations during Netanyahu's Congressional address. Despite ongoing US military aid to Israel since the October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been strained by Israel's war conduct and suspicions of stalling on a peace deal.\n\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in 1,197 deaths in Israel, predominantly civilians, with 111 of the 251 hostages taken still held in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive has resulted in at least 39,175 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Will Prime Minister Netanyahu's first White House visit during his current stint as Israel's leader yield a deal?\n\nThe press on this side of the ocean widely describes the goal of American-led negotiations as \"a cease-fire deal\"; Israeli counterparts are calling it a \"hostage release deal.\" Either way, White House officials say a deal is near.\n\n\"The gaps are closeable, there is no question about that,\" the National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, said Thursday. Yet, \"some compromises have to be made,\" he added, and urged Israel and Hamas to make them.\n\nArriving at the White House, Mr. Netanyahu thanked the president for decades of support for Israel and warmly said he speaks to him as \"a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist.\"\n\nHours after his sit-down with the president, and a joint session with families of American hostages, Mr. Netanyahu met the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Harris. Unlike Mr. Biden, she studiously declines to identify herself as a Zionist, a term that Democratic progressives shun.\n\nFollowing phone calls with Democratic donors who urged Ms. Harris to display more support for Israel, her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, told supporters that the vice president is on the same page as Mr. Biden. She is fully supportive of Israel's existence as a Jewish state and of its right to defend itself, he reportedly said.\n\nYet, Ms. Harris made more forceful statements on the need to end the Gaza war and the suffering of Palestinian civilians. A deal proposed quietly by Mr. Netanyahu was made public by Mr. Biden was later written into a United Nations Security Council resolution. Some unresolved details of that deal were at the heart of Mr. Netanyahu's White House talks Thursday.\n\nAn Israeli team headed by the Mossad chief, David Barnea, will arrive next week at Doha, where it had been scheduled to land Thursday. White House officials and the premier said he wants to first consult with the president before sending the team. Before their White House meeting, however, some hostage relatives reportedly claimed that Mr. Netanyahu is slowing down the negotiations for political reasons.\n\nYet, after their meeting with Messrs. Netanayhu and Biden, \u200fHagit and Rubi Chen, whose Israeli-American son, Itay, is held by Hamas in Gaza, reportedly expressed hope that \"something will happen in the coming days,\" around the hostage deal.\n\nWashington sources tell the Sun that Mr. Netanyahu indeed has a political reason to temporarily slow down progress on a deal: He is concerned that once he signs one, his far-right partners could dissolve his ruling coalition. As the Knesset next week is scheduled to go on a summer recess, he might be able to ignore his right flank. Either way, the White House, ever so gently, is pushing Mr. Netanyahu to end the war.\n\n\"I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, to bring home all the hostages and to bring peace and security to the Middle East, and end this war,\" Mr. Biden said Wednesday during an Oval Office address to the nation. Mr. Netanyahu, in contrast, insists on \"complete victory\" in Gaza, which would include the end to Hamas and return of all hostages.\n\nMr. Netanyahu's plan reportedly calls for Israeli troops to remain in control of the border area between Egypt and Gaza, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, even as Hamas releases more than two-dozen hostages in the deal's first phase. Israel would also monitor movement to the northern part of the strip from the south.\n\nWith such conditions in place, Hamas is unlikely to make a deal, Israeli officials told Kan television news. Further, Israelis doubt statements from Hezbollah and Houthi officials that they would end their multi-prong attack on Israel once the war in Gaza ends.\n\nIn his Wednesday speech, Mr. Netanyahu made clear that Iran is behind these attacks. One of his top asks in the White House meeting was to hasten America's arming of Israel, so it can better confront the Iranian threats. Arms are Mr. Biden's leverage in the twilight of his presidency.\n\nAlso unsaid, but a possible pressure point on Mr. Netanyahu: Even if the premier has to make painful compromises, they would be more favorable for Israel under a president who calls himself Zionist than under a potential future one who shies away from the term.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

Ms Harris' last one-on-one engagement with the Israeli leader was in March 2021, but she has participated in more than 20 calls between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu.\n\nEarlier today, Mr Netanyahu met with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office, with Mr Biden also calling for a winding down of Israel's nine-month-long campaign against Hamas.\n\nSix Democrats have voted with Republicans to condemn Kamala Harris's alleged failure to address the soaring number of undocumented migrants at the US's southern border, writes Andrew Buncombe.\n\nRepublicans claimed the 59-year-old presumptive Democratic nominee had failed to get a grip on what has become a hugely contentious issue in the country, with the vote passing 220 to 196.\n\nThough the resolution is non-binding and largely symbolic, it identifies a weakness that Republicans will likely keep targeting up until the presidential election in November.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nKamala Harris has accused Donald Trump of \"backpedaling\" away from a previous agreement for a debate hosted by ABC News in September.\n\n\"I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on the debate stage,\" the vice-president aid after landing at Joint Base Andrews following a trip to Indiana and Texas.\n\nThe debate, scheduled for September 10, was one of two debates that President Joe Biden and Trump had agreed on. The first one was hosted by CNN on June 27, but Mr Biden has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Ms Harris as his successor.\n\nTrump has said he would prefer to shift the debate to Fox News, but he would be willing to face off with Ms Harris more than once.\n\nKamala Harris said on Thursday she is \"ready\" to debate former President Donald Trump, her Republican rival in a November general election.\n\n\"I'm ready, let's go,\" Ms Harris told reporters.\n\nProtesters against the Gaza war held a \"die-in\" across from Lafayette Park and the White House Thursday as President Joe Biden met with Israeli Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe protesters poured red liquid onto the street, saying it symbolized the blood of those killed in Gaza. They chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of the Israeli prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The jumpsuit reads, \"Wanted for crimes against humanity.\"\n\nHouse Republicans are moving quickly to emphasize Kamala Harris's role in the Biden administration's handling of the US border with Mexico, passing a resolution Thursday that condemns her performance in the job.\n\nThe resolution, which is purely symbolic, echoes an attack line that Donald Trump has taken against Ms Harris since she rose to become the likely Democratic presidential nominee. All House Republicans and six Democrats in tough reelection races voted for the resolution.\n\nNegotiations on a long-sought ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior US official said on Wednesday.\n\nThe official, briefing reporters ahead of the talks, said the remaining obstacles are bridgeable and there will be more meetings aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas over the next week.\n\nUS officials have made similar pledges before about a ceasefire which evaporated under last-minute differences.\n\nOn Wednesday, Benjamin Netanyahu gave a defiant speech to the US Congress in which he defended Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying anti-Israel protesters \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nJoe Biden will tell Benjamin Netanyahu a ceasefire in Gaza is needed \"soon,\" the White House said Thursday, as the leaders met to discuss the country's nine-month war with Hamas militants.\n\n\"We believe that... we can achieve a deal, but it's going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise and an effort to get there. The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon,\" a White House spokesman told reporters.\n\nJennifer Aniston has criticised JD Vance after he called Democrats including Kamala Harris \"childless cat ladies\", writes Susie Coen, US Correspondent.\n\nWriting on Instagram, the Friends star said: \"I truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.

They waited for journalists to settle in the crowded room, then shook hands and sat down.\n\nMr Biden welcomed Mr Netanyahu, who expressed his pleasure at meeting the US president, noting it as a proud Jewish Zionist meeting a proud Irish Zionist.\n\nMr Biden reminded him of how long his relationship with Israeli leaders goes back, recalling his meeting with Golda Meir, a former Israeli prime minister, and a young man who was sitting next to her. That man, Yitzhak Rabin, later became prime minister of Israel.\n\nJournalists shouted many questions, he didn't take any, and seems to shake his head when asked if he dropped out of the race due to health issues.\n\nJoe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu will later meet the families of US hostages held in Gaza.\n\nRelations between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu are tense over Israel's conduct in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attacks, but the US president has continued strong military and political support.\n\nThey have met just three times during his presidency, once in September last year in New York, and then when Mr Biden traveled to Israel after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu on the airport tarmac at Tel Aviv.\n\nThe meetings come after Netanyahu vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas in a fiery speech Wednesday to the US Congress.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu said Thursday he would work with Joe Biden for his remaining time in office, after the US president's stunning decision to drop his reelection bid.\n\n\"I want to thank you for the 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel, and I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead,\" Netanyahu said as he met Mr Biden for the first time at the White House to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu made his long-awaited White House visit Thursday to meet with President Joe Biden and likely Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris at an important moment for all three politicians.\n\nMr Netanyahu's White House visit, his first since before President Donald Trump left office in 2020, comes at a time of growing pressure on all three to find an endgame to the nine-month war, and to free the dozens of Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity.\n\nMr Biden greeted Netanyahu in the Oval Office, where the Israeli leader thanked the president for his service.\n\nKamala Harris has overtaken Donald Trump in a national poll, leading her Republican rival by 46 points to 45.\n\nThe survey, by Morning Consult, found that Ms Harris is winning among independent voters, by 40 per cent to Trump's 38 per cent, and is ahead by three points among voters aged 18-34.\n\nKamala Harris vowed to empower labor unions and prevent school book bans while addressing a powerful teachers' union on Thursday, seeking to draw a sharp contrast with her Republican rival for the presidency Donald Trump.\n\nIn a 20-minute address in Houston to the American Federation of Teachers, Ms Harris, 59, focused on economic policy and workers' rights, touting plans for affordable healthcare and child care and criticizing Republicans for blocking gun limits in the wake of school shootings.\n\n\"Today we face a choice between two very different visions of our nation, one focused on the future and the other focused on the past, and we are fighting for the future,\" she said. \"Donald Trump and his extreme allies want to take our nation back to failed trickle-down economic policies, back to union-busting, back to tax breaks for billionaires.\"\n\nBarack Obama plans to endorse Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate soon, according to reports.\n\nDespite withholding his official endorsement since Ms Harris announced her candidacy on Sunday, Mr Obama has privately lent the vice-president his full support and has been in regular contact with her, NBC News reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the discussions.\n\nIt is understood that Mr Obama also plans to appear alongside Ms Harris on the campaign trail. \"Aides to Obama and Harris have discussed arranging for the two of them to appear together on the campaign trail, though no date has been set,\" NBC reported.\n\nIf the prospect of Donald Trump winning re-election as US president has sent a bad case of the jitters through the Western alliance, just imagine the chaos that will ensue if November's contest results in Vice President Kamala Harris becoming America's next commander-in-chief.\n\nAt least with Trump we have a sense of what to expect if he succeeds in his bid to secure a second term in the White House. On key security issues, such as the future of Nato and the war in Ukraine, Trump has made his views abundantly clear, even if they do not exactly conform with the objectives of other Western leaders.\n\nTrump's constant threat to withdraw Washington from Nato if other member states do not pay their fair share towards its running costs - together with his claim that he could end American support for Ukraine - have resulted in many regarding a second Trump presidency as posing an existential threat to the future of the western alliance.\n\nRead the full comment piece, by Con Coughlin, here.\n\nMs Harris described her Republican opponents as \"extremists\" who \"want to ban books\", an apparent reference to Republican attempts to ban the teaching of controversial gender ideology in US schools.\n\n\"We want to ban assaults weapons and they want to ban books,\" Ms Harris said. \"Can you imagine? All the while these extremists also attack the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.\"\n\nMs Harris said unions had \"helped build America's middle class,\" which was met with applause from the crowd.\n\n\"Thank unions for the five day work week, for the eight hour work day,\" she said. \"Thank unions for sick leave and paid family leave and vacation time. Because the fact is unions helped build America's middle class, and when unions are strong America is strong.\"\n\nMs Harris added: \"Donald and his allies want to cut Medicare and social security, to stop student loan forgiveness for teachers and other public servants, and they even want to eliminate the department of education, and end Head Start.\"\n\nMs Harris said: \"We are clear-eyed. As we work to build a brighter future and to move our nation forward, there are those who are really trying to take us backward. I'm sure you've seen their agenda, Project 2025. Can you believe they put that thing in writing.\"\n\nShe added that Donald Trump wanted to \"take us back\" to \"failed trickle-down economic policies\", including \"union busting\", and giving tax breaks to billionaires.\n\nMs Harris said: \"We see a future with affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, and paid leave. Not for some, but for all. We see a future where every student has the support and the resources they need to thrive.\n\n\"And a future where no teacher has to struggle with the burden of student loan debt. So our administration has forgiven student loan debt for nearly five million Americans.\"\n\nKamala Harris praised the work of teachers in shaping the future of America.\n\nShe said: \"Our teachers and all the members of AFT, you are visionaries, your work is about the future: you see the potential in every child. You foster it, you encourage it, and in so doing you shape the future of our nation. Which is why we need you so badly right now.\"\n\nKamala Harris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters who rallied in Washington during Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister's address to Congress.\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said in an unusually strong statement.\n\nShe said Wednesday's demonstration featured \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.\"\n\nA US flag was still missing from the flagpoles outside Washington's Union Station on Thursday morning, after pro-Palestine demonstrators pulled it down and burned it.\n\nThere were no sign of the protesters themselves, who were doused with pepper spray by police yesterday afternoon. They burned an effigy of Benjamin Netanyahu and waved Palestinian and Hamas flags. A nearby pavement was spray painted with the word \"Gaza\".\n\nKamala Harris is propelling her presidential push by speaking Thursday to the American Federation of Teachers, the first labor union to formally endorse her candidacy.\n\nHaving emerged as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden exited the race, Harris intends to travel aggressively to spread her message and rally voters.\n\nThe campaign push occurs as the former and retooled Biden campaign, now under Ms Harris' control, figures out its strategy for generating turnout and maximizing her time in a 100-plus day sprint to the November election against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu is set to make a long-awaited White House visit to meet with President Joe Biden and likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nIt comes as thousands of protesters descended on Capitol Hill Wednesday to denounce Israel's war in Gaza, while Mr Netanyahu delivered a scathing speech to Congress to defend Israel's conduct in the war and vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas. More protests against Mr Netanyahu are expected outside the White House.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel, and I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nBiden replied that he also looked forward to working with the Israeli leader over his final six months in office, and noted that his first meeting with an Israeli leader -- then-prime minister Golda Meir -- also included Yitzhak Rabin, then an assistant to Meir.\n\nRabin, who served as Israel's head of government from 1974-1977 and regained the prime minister's post in 1992, was the Israeli leader who signed the landmark peace deal that brought the Palestinian Authority into existence and laid out a roadmap for peace that has largely been ignored by Netanyahu. He was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli right-wing extremist who was opposed to the peace process.\n\nThe relatively civil sit-down between the two leaders, which took place less than 24 hours after Biden delivered a televised speech explaining his decision to stand down from seeking re-election, came the day after Netanyahu addressed Congress with a thundering and often bellicose set of remarks in which he condemned pro-Palestinian protesters as \"useful idiots\" who serve the interests of the Iranian government.\n\nBiden has also spent months unsuccessfully attempting to pressure Netanyahu into moderating his approach to his nearly year-old war on Hamas in hopes of bringing about a deal to return the more than 100 hostages who are still being held by the militant group. Both he and Netanyahu were set to meet with American families of hostages still in captivity later on Thursday.\n\nYet White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby told reporters the relationship between the two leaders was a \"healthy\" one.\n\n\"By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything. They haven't, through the long political lives that both of them have have enjoyed, always agreed on everything. They come from two different political traditions, but they know one another,\" he said.\n\nKirby added that he believes Biden is \"very comfortable\" in his relationship with Netanyahu and \"the ability that he has to be candid and honest and lay it all out there\" in talks with the Israeli leader.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golda Meir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yitzhak Rabin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_map_for_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road map for peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/f869f6ed372fa2b604f5cc7d095a3a80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The protesters vandalized statues and burned American flags, replacing them with Palestinian flags.\n\n\"I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews,\" Harris said in a statement on the protests earlier Thursday. \"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation.\"\n\n\"Let us all condemn terrorism and violence,\" Harris said after meeting with Netanyahu Thursday. \"Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. And let us condemn anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and hate of any kind. And let us work to unite our country.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu held a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office earlier in the day, after which the two heads of state met with the families of American hostages.\n\n\"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December, where a little over 100 of Israel's hostages were released,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui is currently being held hostage in Gaza, said.\n\n\"We got absolute commitment from the Biden administration and from Prime Minister Netanyahu that they understand the urgency of this moment now, to waste no time, and to complete this deal as it currently stands.\"\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, the number of Palestinians reported killed since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel is more than 39,000. In addition to reported fatalities, roughly 90,000 Palestinians have been reported injured.\n\nApproximately 1,800 people were killed in Hamas' brutal surprise attack on Israel Oct. 7, 2023, triggering the Israeli military incursion.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,\" said Harris. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint session of the United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran hostage crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/07/108012103-17219490572024-07-25t222852z_208736404_rc2m29awfbxk_rtrmadp_0_israel-palestinians-usa-netanyahu-harris.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3091, "textEnd": 3097}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

US officials said Biden pressed Netanyahu to reach a hostage deal, and the White House claimed that an agreement was closer than ever. However, Reuters reported on Thursday that Israel's new demands are complicating the talks.\n\nPOLITICO reported that while the Israeli delegation is in Washington, Israeli officials are circulating lists among US officials of weapons they want fast-tracked. The report said Israel was \"quietly\" pushing for faster military aid shipments, but Netanyahu also made the demand during his address to Congress on Wednesday.\n\n\"In World War II, as Britain fought on the frontlines of civilization, Winston Churchill appealed to Americans with these famous words: 'Give us the tools and we'll finish the job.'

He first encountered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the White House driveway after a visit with President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nPresident Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel put on pleasant faces and offered polite words on camera on Thursday as they opened a meeting at the White House at a fraught moment in their relationship with the future of the Middle East on the line.\n\nThe president smiled broadly and chatted amiably with Mr. Netanhayu in their first session together in the White House since Mr. Biden took office while the prime minister offered effusive words of praise for his service. But the brief bonhomie masked the deep tensions between them over the war in Gaza and American efforts to broker a cease-fire.\n\n\"Well, welcome back, Mr. Prime Minister,\" Mr. Biden said as the two sat down in the Oval Office. \"We've got a lot to talk about. I think we should get to it.\"\n\nBut the president offered no thoughts about the situation on the ground while reporters were in the room and instead turned the floor over to Mr. Netanyahu, who used the opportunity to express gratitude now that Mr. Biden has dropped his bid for a second term and is winding up his long political career.\n\n\"Mr. President, we've known each other for 40 years and you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years, from Golda Meir,\" Mr. Netanyahu told him. \"So from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.\"\n\nMr. Biden grinned at the reference to him as a \"Irish American Zionist\" and then said he looked forward to their discussions as well. \"By the way, that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, and she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin,\" he said, referring to Yitzhak Rabin, who would later serve as prime minister himself. \"That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then.\"\n\nNeither man referenced their disagreements over the conduct of Israel's war against Hamas nor did they give any hint of the state of negotiations over a possible cease-fire agreement that would suspend and eventually end the war in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Mr. Biden has pressed Israel and Hamas to make a deal but even as Mr. Netanyahu has said he is willing to make an agreement if certain conditions are met, he has been reluctant to end the war without ensuring that Hamas can never repeat the terrorist attack it mounted on Oct. 7.\n\nThe meeting in the Oval Office came a day after Mr. Netanyahu used an address to a joint meeting of Congress to denounce critics of the conduct of Israel's war against Hamas, particularly left-wing protesters he termed \"useful idiots.\" Police used pepper spray outside the Capitol at the time to push back thousands of protesters, some of whom burned an American flag and marred statues with slogans like \"Hamas is coming.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

Trump is perceived by the Israelis as willing to give its military more free reign in its Gaza offensive. Politico had reported on Sunday that Netanyahu will likely delay Gaza ceasefire talks for at least another three months until after the US presidential election. In 2020 he called Trump \"the best friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.\"\n\nNetanyahu is now being widely accused of intentionally stalling progress on a ceasefire, until a new chapter in relations with the White House opens.\n\nAs Biden looked like he struggled to stay awake and focus, Netanyahu praised the Democratic president and career politician for five decades of supporting Israel.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" he said.\n\nBut just within the last months Netanyahu has repeatedly slammed Biden administration policy, particularly after the paused weapons shipment of heavy bombs, with the White House citing the likelihood that using them would result in mass civilian deaths among Palestinians.\n\nThese tensions were apparently still on display to some degree on Thursday. According to a debriefing of their meeting:\n\nAt a news briefing, national security spokesman John Kirby said that Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu discussed the urgent need for a hostage release deal, the potential of conflict spilling over into Lebanon, the threat of Iran and the need to reach \"compromises\" in peace talks.\n\nWhile Mr Kirby added that \"gaps remain\" in the US-Israel relationship, the countries have a \"healthy relationship\".\n\n\"By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything,\" Mr Kirby said, adding that Mr Biden was \"very comfortable with the relationship he has with the prime minister\".\n\nAnd there was plenty of pushback from the press concerning the Oval Office meeting at a time Palestinian civilians continue to be slaughtered by the blunt force that is the IDF offensive in Gaza...\n\nNetanyahu is expected on Friday to meet with former President Donald Trump in Mar-A-Lago on Friday,. Likely the mood will be much 'warmer' as Bibi expects a future Trump administration will involve even more of a 'blank check' for Israel than what it already receives. The Israeli leader is also soon to meet with VP Kamala Harris.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-07/bidenandnety.jpg?itok=ZwwA9MrV", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nThe comments from Harris struck a far more strident tone than the language President Joe Biden has customarily used while discussing the conflict, suggesting an alternate approach the vice president -- now likely the Democratic presidential nominee -- may adopt.\n\nDemocrats are heading into the November election against Republican Donald Trump with the conflict in Gaza threatening to fracture their electoral coalition. Harris has expressed more empathy for Palestinian suffering than Biden throughout the war.\n\nHarris on Thursday acknowledged the domestic political tensions over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"To everyone who has been calling for a cease-fire and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you. Let's get the deal done,\" Harris said.\n\nNetanyahu's visit has put a spotlight on those intraparty tensions. He delivered a fiery address to Congress on Wednesday that defended Israel's war, dismissed concerns about the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza and urged the U.S. to fast-track weapons to help his country achieve victory.\n\nThe speech was boycotted by many top Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and drew massive protests near the U.S. Capitol. Video footage showed some demonstrators pulling down a U.S. flag near Washington Union Station and setting it on fire. Netanyahu in his speech called the protesters \"useful idiots\" for Hamas' backer, Iran.\n\nHarris has denounced what she called \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric\" in Washington. Harris said in a statement she supported the \"right to peacefully protest\" but condemned the burning of the American flag, saying \"it should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nNetanyahu met Biden earlier Thursday, thanking the president for his support of Israel and pledging to continue working together at a meeting marking the U.S. leader's first sit-down with a foreign counterpart since forgoing reelection.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.\n\nNetanyahu said the two had \"known each other for 40 years,\" adding, \"I look forward to working with you in the months ahead.\"\n\nDespite the public display of goodwill, the two leaders have clashed over Israel's conduct of the war against Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and European Union.\n\nThe Israeli leader is also seeking to foster ties with Trump, with a planned visit Friday to the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. The two enjoyed a close relationship during Trump's presidency but they split over Netanyahu's recognition of Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nNetanyahu's address to Congress made no direct mention of a cease-fire proposal put forward by Biden. Senior administration officials said Wednesday that negotiations for a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas are continuing. Netanyahu, however, repeated his stance that the war will not end until Hamas is destroyed.\n\nRepublicans have assailed the vice president for not attending Netanyahu's speech, casting it as a show of disrespect. Harris would have sat behind him on the dais, but was in Indianapolis for a campaign event.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Biden met earlier with Netanyahu but the pair spoke only briefly on camera.\n\nHarris called her talk with Netanyahu \"frank\" and acknowledged how the conflict began last October when Hamas militants infiltrated southern Israel and murdered some 1,200 people, with an estimated 250 taken captive back to Gaza.\n\n\"I repeat: Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,\" Harris said. \"Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization.

The prime minister's visit comes as U.S. officials have expressed optimism about the prospect of a deal to return hostages to their families and end the war. Detailed ceasefire negotiations surrounding a framework agreement are now stretching into their third week.\n\nBiden emphasized in his Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu that he wants Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a ceasefire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby.

Harris' tougher stance contrasts with President Biden's approach, raising questions about potential U.S. policy shifts. The conflict, which began with Hamas' attacks, has caused significant casualties and displacement.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to help reach a Gaza ceasefire deal that would ease the suffering of Palestinian civilians, striking a tougher tone than President Joe Biden. \"It is time for this war to end,\" Harris said in a televised statement after she held face-to-face talks with Netanyahu.\n\nHarris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee after Biden dropped out of the election race on Sunday, did not mince words about the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza after nine months of war between Israel and Hamas militants. \"We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,\" she said.\n\nHarris' remarks were sharp and serious in tone and raised the question of whether she would be more aggressive in dealing with Netanyahu if elected president on Nov. 5. But analysts do not expect there would be a major shift in U.S. policy toward Israel, Washington's closest ally in the Middle East. The conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory attack in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people and caused a humanitarian calamity with most of the coastal enclave leveled, people displaced from their homes, famine and a shortage of emergency relief. Biden met with Netanyahu but did not make substantive remarks. Aides said he pressed for a ceasefire in his first face-to-face talks with the Israeli leader since Biden traveled to Tel Aviv in the days after Oct. 7.\n\nNetanyahu will meet Harris' Republican rival, Donald Trump, on Friday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. A ceasefire has been the subject of negotiations for months. U.S. officials believe the parties are closer than ever before to an agreement for a six-week ceasefire in exchange for the release by Hamas of women, sick, elderly and wounded hostages.\n\n\"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal, and as I just told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,\" Harris said. Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself, she made clear on Thursday that she was losing patience with Israel's military approach.\n\n\"Israel has a right to defend itself. And how it does so matters,\" Harris said. In March, she bluntly stated that Israel was not doing enough to ease a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" during its ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave. Later, she did not rule out \"consequences\" for Israel if it launched a full-scale invasion of refugee-packed Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nA DIVIDED PARTY The Gaza conflict has splintered the Democratic Party, and sparked months of protests at Biden events. A drop in support among Arab Americans could hurt Democratic chances in Michigan, one of a handful of states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.\n\nIn a nod to those concerns, Harris urged Americans to help \"encourage efforts to understand the complexity, the nuance and the history of the region.\" \"To everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you,\" she said. \"Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war.\"\n\nIn an Oval Office address on Wednesday, Biden cited a desire for unity in the Democratic Party as it seeks to defeat Trump as a main reason he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race. Harris maintains closer ties to Democratic progressives, some of whom have urged Biden to attach conditions to U.S. weapons shipments to Israel out of concern for high Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza. The U.S. is a major arms supplier to Israel and has protected the country from critical United Nations votes.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu met together with the families of Americans held by Hamas, who expressed hope for a ceasefire including a release of hostages. \"We came today with a sense of urgency,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son is a captive.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

In addition to reported fatalities, roughly 90,000 Palestinians have been reported injured.\n\nApproximately 1,800 people were killed in Hamas' brutal surprise attack on Israel Oct. 7, 2023, triggering the Israeli military incursion.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,\" said Harris. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.

They must ensure humanitarian personnel, sites, and convoys are not targeted.\"\n\nHamas has repeatedly denied ceasefire offers, stolen aid, killed aid workers, the Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nIn response to the protests that have led to violence and graduation cancellations, Harris said in an interview that the protesters \"are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza.\"\n\n\"I understand the emotion behind it,\" Harris added.\n\nThe vice president chose to not preside over Netanyahu's address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, instead opting to attend a convention for the historically-black Zeta Phi Beta sorority in Indiana.\n\nHarris has not always been so critical of Israel.\n\nIn 2017, she delivered a speech at an AIPAC conference where she declared \"the bonds between the United States and Israel are unbreakable and we can never let anyone drive a wedge between us.\" That year, then-Senator Harris and her husband visited Israel. It was the first trip to Israel for Emhoff, who is Jewish, but Harris's third trip, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nNetanyahu met with Biden earlier on Thursday and delivered brief remarks about their decades-long relationship.\n\n\"Mr. President, we have known each other for 40 years, and you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years, from Golda Meir,\" Netanyahu said. \"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel.\"\n\n\"I look forward to it as well,\" Biden responded. \"That first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, and she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin, that's how far back it goes,\" he said referring to former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.\n\nNetanyahu and Biden also met with the families of American hostages at the White House.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"},

Netanyahu's visit occurs as the Israel-Hamas war reaches nearly 10 months. In addition to meeting with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Netanyahu also met with President Joe BIden and families of American Hostages held by Hamas. (Photo by Kenny Holston/Getty Images-Pool)\n\nWASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday afternoon, a day after he vowed to Congress that he wants \"total victory\" in the deadly Gaza war.\n\nHarris said she and Netanyahu had a \"constructive\" meeting and that she expressed to the prime minister \"serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza.\" Harris also said she stands by a two-state solution for the region as the \"only path\" to peace.\n\n\"I've said it many times, but it bears repeating: Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,\" Harris said during remarks from the White House following the meeting.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,\" she said.\n\nHarris said there has been \"hopeful movement\" for a cease-fire deal that includes the release of all hostages and a phased withdrawal of the Israeli military.\n\n\"And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu it is time to get this deal done,\" she said.\n\nHarris, now vying for president after President Joe Biden exited the race Sunday, will inevitably face demands and questions from voters, including reliably Democratic young and progressive blocs, who want to see an immediate and permanent cease-fire, and the release of all hostages.\n\nCease-fire negotiations have been stop-and-start for months, including on a Biden-backed proposal announced in May.\n\nThe death toll in the Gaza Strip has surpassed 39,000 since Israel's offensive began nearly 10 months ago, according to Gaza health officials in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory.\n\nNetanyahu told lawmakers during a joint meeting of Congress in the U.S. House chamber Wednesday that he will accept \"nothing less\" than total defeat over Hamas, the militant group that invaded Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,100 and taking upwards of 200 hostages.\n\n\"The day after we defeat Hamas, a new Gaza could emerge,\" Netanyahu said. \"My vision for that day is of a demilitarized and deradicalized Gaza. Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza. But for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\nIsrael's parliament voted overwhelmingly on July 18 to disapprove of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, bucking Biden's longstanding advocacy for a two-state solution in the region.\n\nNetanyahu's meeting with Harris followed his afternoon meeting with Biden separately, and both then met with the families of hostages still held captive by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSeemingly in reference to the uprising of protests across the U.S. over the Gaza war, Harris asked Americans to \"encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the nuance, and the history of the region.\"\n\nNetanyahu's trip to Washington attracted thousands of protesters to areas surrounding Capitol Hill who demanded the U.S. stop providing aid and weapons to Israel.\n\nFollowing Netanyahu's near hour-long address to lawmakers, demonstrators amassed outside the city's Union Station, where they burned American flags and graffitied the words \"Hamas is coming\" among other messages on a statue and fountain dedicated to Christopher Columbus, according to numerous media reports.\n\nHarris issued a statement Thursday morning condemning the \"despicable\" events outside Union Station, just under a half-mile from the Capitol.\n\n\"I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said.\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag,\" Harris said in the statement issued by the Office of the Vice President. Harris continued that she supports the right to peacefully protest, \"but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

"Netanyahu meets with Biden and Harris at crucial moment for the US and Israel", "body": "Mr Netanyahu's White House visit, his first since before Donald Trump left office in 2020, comes at a time of growing pressure on all three to find an endgame to the nine-month war that has left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza.\n\nDozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity.\n\nMr Biden greeted Mr Netanyahu in the Oval Office, where the Israeli leader thanked the president for his service.\n\nMr Biden is pressing to get Israel and Hamas to seal a US-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases -- something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for the 81-year-old Democrat, who abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed Ms Harris.\n\nIt could also be a boon for Ms Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nWhite House officials say that the negotiations are in the closing stages but there are issues that need to be resolved.\n\nFollowing their midday talks, Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu will meet the families of American hostages.\n\nMs Harris, who will meet separately with Mr Netanyahu later, is trying to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief.\n\nShe is being scrutinised by those on the political left who say Mr Biden has not done enough to force Mr Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nMr Netanyahu, in a fiery address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, offered a robust defence of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes.\n\nHe made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East\".\n\nThe Israeli leader spent scant time discussing the ongoing negotiations.", "source": {"uri":

A day earlier, a senior administration official told reporters that the two were working out details of a cease-fire and hostage-release deal, \"which we believe is in the closing stages.\"\n\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Prime Minister,\" Biden said Thursday. \"We've got a lot to talk about, maybe we should get to it.\"\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu replied. \"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues of importance.\"\n\nNetanyahu will meet later on Thursday with Vice President Kamala Harris, and on Friday with former President Donald Trump, the Republican challenger in this tight, intense presidential race.\n\nA senior administration official on Wednesday told reporters during a background briefing that the White House meeting will include discussion of threats to Israel from Iran-backed groups in the Middle East such as Hamas, Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi militants.\n\nIn addition to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Biden and Netanyahu's agenda also includes talk about efforts to secure a cease-fire deal featuring a halt in fighting, the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, the release of some Palestinian prisoners from Israel and a surge of humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe United States has been working with Egypt and Qatar to broker the cease-fire talks, which have stretched on for months amid competing demands from Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe official said there is a framework in place for the first stage of an envisioned three-stage agreement, and that the U.S. expects \"a lot of activity over the coming week\" as negotiators try to seal an agreement.\n\nThe first stage would last for 42 days and include Hamas releasing some of the hostages, including women, men over the age of 50, and those who are sick and wounded. The U.S. official said what is left to figure out are the implementation steps for the first phase, \"how it will actually work day-to-day.\"\n\n\"There are some things we need from Hamas, and there are some things we need from the Israeli side,\" the official said.\n\nFollowing their meeting, Biden and Netanyahu will meet with families of Americans who are among the hostages.\n\nNetanyahu went before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday to deliver a speech defending his country's war against Hamas and vowing to pursue the fight against Palestinian militants until \"total victory\" and the return of the remaining hostages they are holding.\n\nWith thousands of pro-Palestinian, anti-war protesters in the streets outside the U.S. Capitol and more than 50 Democratic lawmakers boycotting his speech, Netanyahu said he was confident that negotiations for a cease-fire would eventually succeed. But he gave no hint of a breakthrough in the stalemated, monthslong talks.\n\nInstead, he blamed Hamas for the continuation of the war. He attacked Iran for its funding of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, while assailing the nearby protesters and those at U.S. college campuses in recent months as \"Iran's useful idiots\" helping Israel's enemies.\n\nThe Israeli-Hamas war started with the October 7 Hamas terror attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's subsequent counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, most of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type":

Getty Images\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referenced US President Joe Biden's Irish American roots twice while in the US this week.\n\n\"President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,\" Netanyahu said in his address on Wednesday before a special joint meeting of US Congress.\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship with Israel and for being, as he says, 'a proud Zionist.'\n\nNetanyahu, who an International Criminal Court prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for in relation to \"war crimes\" in Palestine, was invited to address US Congress by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries on May 31.\n\nAccording to Politico earlier on Wednesday, more than 50 members of Congress had publicly indicated plans to boycott or not attend Netanyahu's address. Meanwhile, thousands of protesters converged on Washington on Wednesday to condemn the Israeli Prime Minister's visit, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu, addressing the press next to Biden in The White House, repeated his \"Irish American Zionist\" description of the President.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin @Netanyahu: \"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel.\" pic.twitter.com/8kDq9D3D4F -- CSPAN (@cspan)\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\nIndeed, Biden regularly touts his Irish American roots and has publicly referred to himself as a Zionist on multiple occasions, but it is unclear if he has publicly referred to himself as a \"proud Irish American Zionist.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Complex's Speedy Morman on July 12, Biden was asked why his and the United States' support for Israel is so strong.\n\nThe President replied: \"If there weren't an Israel, every Jew in the world would be at risk. And so, there's a need for it to be strong and a need for Israel to have, after World War II, the ability for Jews to have a place that was their own.\n\n\"You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. And a Zionist is about whether or not Israel is a safe haven for Jews because of their history of how they've been persecuted.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Biden defended providing weapons to Israel, stating that he approved \"defensive weapons, I denied them offensive weapons.\" He added: \"I made it real clear, they cannot use weapons that we provide to use in civilian areas.\"\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, as of July 22, at least 39,006 Palestinians have been reportedly killed and another 89,818 Palestinians have been reportedly injured in the Gaza Strip since October 7.\n\nBiden's equal embrace of his Irish roots and Zionism has drawn considerable criticism in Ireland in recent months. In November, a mural of Biden in Co Mayo was sprayed with 'Genocide Joe' graffiti. An open letter urging Irish citizens to revoke their symbolic support of Biden has drawn more than 20,000 signatures since December. Ahead of St. Patrick's Day this year, there were widespread calls for Irish politicians to boycott the annual engagements at the White House. Last month, a petition was launched to take down the mural of Biden in Co Mayo.\n\nIn perhaps the most stark difference between Ireland and the US, Ireland formally recognized the State of Palestine in May. Including Ireland, 145 out of the 193 UN member states have now recognized a Palestinian state - the US is not among them.\n\nAfter Ireland's formal recognition, questions arose about the implications it might have on the relationship between Ireland and the US.\n\nWhile some Irish people are critical of Biden, Israeli officials have been, in turn, critical of Ireland. The Israeli Foreign Minister has launched fierce, sometimes bizarre, criticisms of Ireland, and has accused Ireland of 'bolstering the terrorist monster' by recognizing Palestine.\n\nNetanyahu delivered his address in Congress on Wednesday afternoon just a few days after Biden announced he was standing down from the 2024 Presidential election.\n\nBiden's Vice President Kamala Harris, who has now become the presumptive Democratic nominee for this year's presidential election, did not attend Netanyahu's address on Wednesday as she was in Indianapolis for a pre-scheduled event.\n\nWith Harris becoming the presumptive nominee, questions surrounding her position on Israel have begun to arise.\n\nHarris, whose husband Douglas Emhoff is Jewish, has aligned with Biden's supportive stance on Israel but did emerge as the first member of the Biden administration to publicly call for a ceasefire.\n\nShe said in March: \"Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.\"\n\nWhat we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating, and our common humanity compels us to act.\n\nGiven the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks. pic.twitter.com/mst8N9HxKa -- Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris)\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\nLater, in May, just three days after Ireland formally recognized Palestine, Biden unveiled what he called \"a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages.\" Taoiseach Simon Harris afterward urged Israel and Hamas to accept the plan.\n\nBiden and Harris were each due to meet with Netanyahu separately on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, ahead of the meetings, a senior administration official at the White House said: \"...I think the message [Biden and Harris] are sending to the Prime Minister tomorrow is that we're completely aligned; it's time to do all we can to close the hostage deal, get the hostages home.\n\n\"And also, we as an administration will continue to do all we possibly can to continue to support Israel's self-defense against Iran, Hezbollah, all the threats ... and the Houthis and everything else. \"\n\nThe official added: \"Between the President and Vice President, the Israelis will hear full alignment.\"\n\nThe White House Press Secretary said Biden and Netanyahu will \"discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States' ironclad commitment to Israel's security, including countering Iran's threats to Israel and the broader region.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an aide told the Wall Street Journal that Harris is expected to tell Netanyahu \"it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans", "type":

On Sunday, Biden, 81, stepped aside from the U.S. presidential race under pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed Harris for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n\"We've got a lot to talk about,\" Biden said when he welcomed Netanyahu to the Oval Office.\n\n\"I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nIn the late afternoon, Harris will meet the Israeli leader in her ceremonial office at the White House.\n\nThe meeting will be closely watched for signs of how Harris, who was the first top U.S. official to call for a ceasefire, could shift American policy toward Israel if she becomes president.\n\nHarris was expected to closely track the administration line in the meeting, a U.S. official said, focusing on the plight of Palestinians while also supporting Israel's right to self-defense.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu later were due to meet together with the families of American hostages held by Hamas.\n\nRelations between the two leaders have been strained for months over Israel's Gaza offensive in which more than 39,000 people have been killed, say health officials in Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. is a major arms supplier to Israel and has protected the country from critical United Nations votes.\n\nNetanyahu's visit, his first to Israel's most important international ally since his late 2022 return to power for a record sixth term as prime minister, comes on the heels of Biden's dramatic decision not to seek reelection.\n\nWhether Biden, who is now a \"lame duck\" president, a term used for officials who won't serve another term, or Harris, who is tied in many election polls with Republican rival Donald Trump, can have any influence on Netanyahu remains to be seen.\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu travels to Florida to meet Trump.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris are eager for a ceasefire. Harris has been aligned with Biden on Israel but has struck a tougher tone.\n\nThe conflict began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people. Israel launched a retaliatory assault.\n\nHamas-led fighters took 250 captives on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.\n\nThe White House is ringed with extra security fencing to protect against protesters on Thursday.\n\nNegotiations on a long-sought ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.\n\nThe official, briefing reporters ahead of the talks, said the remaining obstacles are bridgeable and there will be more meetings aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas over the next week.\n\nU.S. officials have made similar pledges before about a ceasefire which evaporated under last-minute differences.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu gave a defiant speech to the U.S. Congress in which he defended Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying anti-Israel protesters \"should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nThe Gaza conflict has splintered the Democratic Party, and sparked months of protests at Biden events. A drop in support among Arab-Americans could hurt Democratic chances in Michigan, one of a handful of states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.\n\nBiden's desire for unity in the party in the drive to defeat Trump was cited on Wednesday night in an Oval Office address as a main reason why he decided not to seek reelection but to instead support Harris for the 2024 race.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Daphne Psaledakis.

But Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, said she also remains concerned about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, \"including the death of far too many innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating - the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" she said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.

Negotiators have continued to pursue the deal in hopes it will bring about an eventual end to the war.\n\n\"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,\" she said. \"So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you. Let's get the deal done.\"\n\nHarris said she also remains committed to a path forward that could lead to a two-state solution.\n\n\"I know right now it is hard to conceive of that prospect, but a two-state solution is the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure Jewish and democratic state and one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security and prosperity that they rightly deserve,\" she said.\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

Harris emphasized the importance of how Israel defends itself, expressing her serious concerns about the human suffering in the region.\n\nHer remarks, both sharp and serious, suggest a potential policy shift from President Joe Biden.

But the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, appeared less impressed with Israel's messaging the next day.\n\nIsrael must end the war in Gaza \"and get it done quickly,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on Fox News on Thursday. He argued that Israel was \"getting decimated\" by negative publicity over its conduct of the war, set off by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Since then, more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gazan health authorities, and the war has wreaked widespread disease, hunger and destruction.\n\n\"Israel is not very good at public relations,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe comments came a day before a scheduled meeting on Friday between the former president and Mr. Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's private residence and club in Palm Beach, Fla. But it is not clear that the Israeli prime minister -- who praised the former president in his congressional address -- would agree with Mr. Trump about wrapping up the conflict.\n\nIn his speech to U.S. lawmakers, Mr. Netanyahu vowed that Israel would fight until Hamas was eradicated. He did not say what many Israelis, especially the relatives of hostages in Gaza, wanted to hear: that he would close a cease-fire deal with Hamas to end the war and return about 115 people taken from Israel on Oct. 7 who remain in Gaza, several dozen of whom are believed to be dead.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli military announced that two of the remaining hostages were dead. On Thursday, the Israeli military announced that five hostages' bodies had been found in tunnels in an operation in Khan Younis and returned to Israel from Gaza.\n\nThe steady drumbeat of bad news about the captives underscores the urgency of a deal for the hostages' relatives, some of whom met with Mr. Netanyahu in Washington this week, including at a gathering with President Biden at the White House on Thursday. They expressed optimism about the possibility of a deal when they emerged from the meeting, and told reporters in a briefing that Mr. Netanyahu understood the urgency of the need for a cease-fire.\n\nIt is a point that Mr. Trump may make at Mar-a-Lago, too, telling Mr. Netanyahu what he told Fox News: \"Finish up.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ephrat_livni@nytimes.com", "name": "Ephrat Livni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/25mideast-crisis-Trump-vjwk/25mideast-crisis-Trump-vjwk-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 562, "textEnd": 568, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

They've tried to sow discord. They've obviously contributed to some funding of some protesters,\" Kirby said.\n\nWhile Biden is now a lame-duck President, sealing a ceasefire deal would still represent a victory for his administration, just as Vice President Kamala Harris gears up to take on Donald Trump in the November 2024 elections.\n\nKirby said that gaps remain in the negotiations but that \"we are closer now than we've been before\" to a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.\n\nCeasefire talks have dragged on for months, with Hamas wary of reaching an agreement with Israel that does not guarantee a permanent end to the fighting.\n\nNetanyahu's government has said it reserves the right to continue its war after the hostages are released, but is under pressure from members of Iran's so-called Axis of Resistance. It is trading near-daily fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Last week, a drone fired by the Houthis in Yemen hit Tel Aviv, killing one Israeli and injuring others.\n\nDavid Schenker, a former senior US official now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that Netanyahu's visit is unlikely to change the dynamics on the battlefield, but said a ceasefire may be closer.\n\n\"My guess is a ceasefire will happen in the coming weeks, after the Knesset goes into recess,\" he said, adding that the timing could \"insulate\" Netanyahu from a vote of no-confidence or other shows of no-confidence from his far-right government allies who are opposed to a truce.\n\nIn his speech to Congress, Netanyahu discussed efforts to secure the release of hostages but did not mention any progress on a ceasefire.", "source": {"uri":

A senior administration official who previewed the meeting said the discussion would focus on the Middle East and, specifically, the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAfter the public meeting -- which lasted only 134 seconds, according to this C-SPAN video -- both leaders and their delegations planned to meet with families of American hostages held by Hamas.\n\nPerhaps the most significant news item extracted from the brief public meeting is a question that Biden responded to using his body language.\n\nAfter Biden and Netanyahu gave their brief remarks and posed for a photo op, a White House reporter shouted a poignant question at the president: Did you drop out of the 2024 election because of your health?\n\nIt's an important question because Biden's letter announcing his decision to step aside and his Oval Office address on Wednesday did not specify why he chose to leave the race.\n\nBut on Thursday, Biden appeared to answer the question -- finally.\n\n\"President Biden shook his head no when I asked him in the Oval Office if he dropped out of the race for health reasons,\" reported Reagan Reese.\n\nA second reporter, Nadia Bilbassy-Charters, corroborated Reese's report.\n\n\"Journalists shouted many questions, he didn't take any, and seems to shake his head when asked if he dropped out of the race due to health issues,\" wrote Bilbassy-Charters in a pool report.\n\nThe bilateral meeting came one day after Netanyahu delivered a speech to Congress. His presence in Washington set off violence in the nation's capital from pro-Hamas, far-left protesters who burned American flags and waved the Hamas flag.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golda Meir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C-SPAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran hostage crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/biden-meets-with-israeli-pm-for-just-134-seconds-before-kicking-out-reporters-but-one-head-shake-tells-a-story.jpg?id=52974110&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C55%2C0%2C68", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 315, "textEnd": 321}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

His plane, known as the Wing of Zion, landed in the US capital on Monday, July 22.\n\nThe skies were clear that day, but the political atmosphere in Washington was not. The US has been experiencing challenging times, marked by deep societal divisions and a seeming departure from the foundational values established by the Founding Fathers.\n\nDuring his visit, Netanyahu faced strained relations with the Democratic Party. Many Democrats criticized his hardline stance on the Palestinian issue and allegations of corruption. These tensions were further heightened by Netanyahu's repeated attempts to align himself with Republicans, giving the impression that he sought to influence US domestic politics. Additionally, former President Donald Trump expressed disappointment in Netanyahu for publicly congratulating Joe Biden on his 2020 election victory, viewing it as an act of disloyalty. This visit underscored not only Netanyahu's efforts to strengthen US-Israeli ties but also highlighted the deep political divisions currently present within American society.\n\nNetanyahu's visit to the US had been planned well in advance, as part of ongoing diplomatic efforts. A month prior, on June 22, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant traveled to Washington. He held meetings with senior US officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The discussions covered security concerns along the Lebanese border, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, and its \"third phase\" that is supposed to follow the cessation of active hostilities in the enclave. The meetings also focused on defense cooperation between Israel and the US, a crucial element for the security of the Israeli state.\n\nThe situation in Gaza remains complex, causing significant tension in US-Israeli relations. The Israeli military continues operations to neutralize the threat posed by Hamas, often drawing criticism from the international community and segments of the American public. The Biden administration seeks to balance support for Israel with the need to provide humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians, sometimes leading to disagreements between the two nations. Nevertheless, the US and Israel continue to actively collaborate in defense and intelligence, a vital aspect of their strategic partnership. However, issues surrounding peaceful resolution, and the protection of Palestinian civilians remain contentious topics, complicating diplomatic relations.\n\nWhat does Netanyahu seek from Washington?\n\nThe objectives of Netanyahu's visit extended far beyond those of his defense minister. Netanyahu aimed to use his meeting with Biden and an address before Congress to restore his image as a staunch defender of Israel and to strengthen his ties with the American political elite. His last visit to Washington, in September 2020, was marked by the signing of a peace agreement with the United Arab Emirates, a significant diplomatic achievement facilitated by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nThe scheduled meeting with Biden, however, was postponed due to the US president's Covid-19 infection, with no new date set. Netanyahu's agenda also included meetings with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is likely preparing for her presidential run, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Netanyahu also planned a meeting with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe primary goal of the visit, as stated by Israeli officials, was to appeal to American lawmakers for bipartisan support for Israel in its conflict with the Palestinian movement Hamas and other adversaries, including Iran and the \"axis of resistance.\" Amid political instability in Washington, Netanyahu sought to secure the backing of the US as a key ally in confronting anti-Israel forces.\n\nIn his address to Congress, Netanyahu sought to avoid confrontation with the Biden administration and emphasized the importance of supporting Israel. Despite some Democrats expressing intentions to boycott the speech due to Israel's actions in Gaza, and protests occurring outside the Capitol from both American activists and Israeli democracy supporters, Netanyahu received a warm welcome with standing ovations as he entered the chamber.\n\nHe began his speech by thanking all the participants and referring to the venue as the \"citadel of democracy.\" He then stated that the \"Iranian axis of terrorism\" opposes America, Israel, and their Arab friends, framing the conflict not as a clash of civilizations but as a battle of \"barbarians against civilization,\" and asserted that \"the US and Israel must stand together.\"\n\nHis speech was well-prepared, highlighting the \"brutality\" of Palestinian militant groups. Netanyahu brought with him members of the Israeli military fighting in Gaza, including representatives of the Ethiopian and Bedouin communities, to demonstrate that \"Muslims, Christians, and Jews\" are fighting together to defend Israel. He addressed the issue of civilian casualties, insisting that for Israel, \"the loss of civilian life is a tragedy, while for Hamas, it is a strategy.\" Netanyahu called for providing the Israeli Defense Forces with \"the necessary tools\" to achieve victory, implying a request for American military aid.\n\nAs expected, Netanyahu praised Biden and the Democrats for their friendship and support for democratic Israel, while also expressing gratitude to Trump and the Republicans for their support, including the recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory and Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nIn summary, Netanyahu's visit was aimed at securing support, resolving current disagreements between Washington and West Jerusalem, and ensuring backing from future US administrations. Additionally, this visit served to bolster Netanyahu's position within Israel, sending a message to the Israeli public that he maintains strong \"allied relations\" with the US, despite recent pressures.\n\nTimes have changed\n\nThe visit took place in a markedly different political landscape compared to the previous one. His government, the most conservative in Israel's history, has faced significant challenges, including the tragic events of October 7, which were the largest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Recent polls showed that 72% of Israelis want him to resign, either immediately or after the Gaza war is over. Despite the criticism and dissatisfaction, Netanyahu has retained power with a majority in the Knesset and avoided the threat of early elections.\n\nNetanyahu's visit to Washington occurred against a backdrop of global and regional shifts that could potentially be historic. Tensions on Israel's northern borders have escalated, with open conflict with Hezbollah becoming a daily reality as both sides exchange strikes. The \"axis of resistance\" also continues its attacks on Western military targets in the region and Israel, while another round of escalation has been observed between the IDF and the Yemeni Houthi movement, Ansar Allah.\n\nThe Houthis launched an attack on Tel Aviv with a new drone called Jaffa on the night of July 19, prompting Israel to strike various targets in the port city of Hodeidah, Yemen, according to the Israeli army's press office. The growing external threats are making it increasingly difficult for Israel to maintain security, with Netanyahu stating before his departure to Washington that Jerusalem was currently engaged in military actions on \"seven fronts.\"\n\nHowever, Israel itself has played a role in intensifying the situation. On July 18, the Israeli Knesset passed a resolution rejecting the creation of a Palestinian state, citing it as a threat to Israel's existence and its citizens. The resolution argued that establishing such a state on the West Bank would perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region. The authors of the resolution also claimed it would reward terrorism, bolstering Hamas and other radical forces.\n\nThe resolution was supported by Netanyahu's coalition parties, right-wing opposition parties, and the centrist National Unity party led by Benny Gantz. The left-centrist party Yesh Atid, headed by Yair Lapid, opposed the resolution, advocating for a two-state solution, and walked out of the session. This all unfolded as Netanyahu prepared for his US visit, fully aware that such a decision by the Knesset could strain US-Israel relations, given the Democratic Party's support for a two-state solution.\n\nMoreover, there were signs of progress in resolving disputes among various Palestinian factions. On July 23, 14 Palestinian factions concluded three-day talks in China, signing the Beijing Declaration on reconciliation. The document called for the formation of a temporary government of national unity under the PLO after the war's end. Signatories included Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Fatah. The main goal was to unite Palestinian institutions, hold general elections, and rebuild Gaza with support from Russia, China, and Algeria.\n\nChina, acting as a mediator, proposed a three-stage plan for resolving the Palestinian issue, including a ceasefire, reconstruction of Gaza, and full UN membership for Palestine. The Chinese side, represented by Foreign Minister Wang Yi, emphasized that Beijing had no selfish interests and supported the Palestinian people's restoration of their legitimate rights. However, optimism about the implementation of the agreements under the Beijing Declaration should be tempered, as similar efforts in 2022 in Algeria remained on paper.\n\nThus, Netanyahu's visit to the US was crucial for the Israeli government and the future of Israel. The times have indeed changed. Russia and China are actively expanding their influence in the Middle East, while Israel's main ally, the US, appears to be losing its grip. Iran and various anti-Israel forces are growing stronger, expanding their military capabilities, and the Palestinians seem to recognize the importance of uniting their efforts for a common future. Even within the US, the situation is not smooth, with Biden stepping out of the presidential race, an assassination attempt on Trump, and a lack of unity among Democrats regarding support for Kamala Harris as a candidate in the upcoming election.\n\nThe region has been in turmoil for ten months, with no end in sight to the ongoing conflict. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as the Houthi movement, are intensifying, and anti-government protests continue within the country. Unfortunately, these developments suggest that the Promised Land may be on the brink of its most challenging period since 1948. This sentiment was echoed by Netanyahu, as well as by Gallant during his own visit to Washington.\n\nThe US has been and will always remain Israel's most important ally, regardless of who occupies the Oval Office, as the protection of \"Israel's friends\" is paramount. The recent US military transport flights over Turkey to Syria and Iraq indicate that Washington is preparing for a worsening situation. However, the strength of support will largely depend on the election campaign and the outcome of the presidential election. However, Netanyahu seeks to assure both Democrats and Republicans that \"Israel and the US are allies forever.\" The citizens of Israel must also understand the importance of Netanyahu, as only he can protect them, and no one else has such strong and enduring ties with Washington, which will also help Israel.", "source": {"uri": "irishsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Sun"}, "authors":

Ms Harris' last one-on-one engagement with the Israeli leader was in March 2021, but she has participated in more than 20 calls between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu.\n\nEarlier today, Mr Netanyahu met with Mr Biden in the Oval Office, with the president calling for Israel to wind down its nine-month-long campaign against Hamas.\n\n11:11 PM BST\n\nThat's all for today.\n\nThanks for following the Telegraph's live blog.

On key security issues, such as the future of Nato and the war in Ukraine, Trump has made his views abundantly clear, even if they do not exactly conform with the objectives of other Western leaders.\n\nTrump's constant threat to withdraw Washington from Nato if other member states do not pay their fair share towards its running costs - together with his claim that he could end American support for Ukraine - have resulted in many regarding a second Trump presidency as posing an existential threat to the future of the western alliance.\n\nRead the full comment piece, by Con Coughlin, here.\n\n05:10 PM BST\n\nPictured: Harris addresses teaching union\n\n05:00 PM BST\n\nHarris: Trump 'extremists' want to 'ban books'\n\nMs Harris described her Republican opponents as \"extremists\" who \"want to ban books\", an apparent reference to Republican attempts to ban the teaching of controversial gender ideology in US schools.\n\n\"We want to ban assaults weapons and they want to ban books,\" Ms Harris said. \"Can you imagine? All the while these extremists also attack the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.\"\n\n04:56 PM BST\n\nUnions built US middle class, says Harris\n\nMs Harris said unions had \"helped build America's middle class,\" which was met with applause from the crowd.\n\n\"Thank unions for the five day work week, for the eight hour work day,\" she said. \"Thank unions for sick leave and paid family leave and vacation time. Because the fact is unions helped build America's middle class, and when unions are strong America is strong.\"\n\n04:53 PM BST\n\nHarris: Trump wants to 'cut Medicare'\n\nMs Harris added: \"Donald and his allies want to cut Medicare and social security, to stop student loan forgiveness for teachers and other public servants, and they even want to eliminate the department of education, and end Head Start.\"\n\n04:51 PM BST\n\nHarris: Trump wants to drag country backwards\n\nMs Harris said: \"We are clear-eyed. As we work to build a brighter future and to move our nation forward, there are those who are really trying to take us backward. I'm sure you've seen their agenda, Project 2025. Can you believe they put that thing in writing.\"\n\nShe added that Donald Trump wanted to \"take us back\" to \"failed trickle-down economic policies\", including \"union busting\", and giving tax breaks to billionaires.\n\n04:46 PM BST\n\nHarris: Cancel student debt for teachers\n\nMs Harris said: \"We see a future with affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, and paid leave.

So our administration has forgiven student loan debt for nearly five million Americans.\"\n\n04:43 PM BST\n\nTeachers 'shape America's future'\n\nKamala Harris praised the work of teachers in shaping the future of America.\n\nShe said: \"Our teachers and all the members of AFT, you are visionaries, your work is about the future: you see the potential in every child. You foster it, you encourage it, and in so doing you shape the future of our nation. Which is why we need you so badly right now.\"\n\n04:39 PM BST\n\nHarris condemns 'despicable' flag burning\n\nKamala Harris on Thursday condemned the \"despicable\" and \"unpatriotic\" burning of an American flag by protesters who rallied in Washington during Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister's address to Congress.\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said in an unusually strong statement.\n\nShe said Wednesday's demonstration featured \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.\"\n\n04:22 PM BST\n\nJill Biden addresses US Olympic athletes\n\n04:08 PM BST\n\nUS flag still missing from Washington's Union Station\n\nA US flag was still missing from the flagpoles outside Washington's Union Station on Thursday morning, after pro-Palestine demonstrators pulled it down and burned it.\n\nThere were no sign of the protesters themselves, who were doused with pepper spray by police yesterday afternoon. They burned an effigy of Benjamin Netanyahu and waved Palestinian and Hamas flags. A nearby pavement was spray painted with the word \"Gaza\".\n\n03:51 PM BST\n\nHarris to address teachers union\n\nKamala Harris is propelling her presidential push by speaking Thursday to the American Federation of Teachers, the first labor union to formally endorse her candidacy.\n\nHaving emerged as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden exited the race, Harris intends to travel aggressively to spread her message and rally voters.\n\nThe campaign push occurs as the former and retooled Biden campaign, now under Ms Harris' control, figures out its strategy for generating turnout and maximizing her time in a 100-plus day sprint to the November election against Republican Donald Trump.\n\n03:38 PM BST\n\nNetanyahu to meet Biden and Harris\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu is set to make a long-awaited White House visit to meet with President Joe Biden and likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nIt comes as thousands of protesters descended on Capitol Hill Wednesday to denounce Israel's war in Gaza, while Mr Netanyahu delivered a scathing speech to Congress to defend Israel's conduct in the war and vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas. More protests against Mr Netanyahu are expected outside the White House.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_murphy@aol.co.uk",

'So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace. I see you and I hear you: Let's get this deal done.'\n\nThe vice president started her statement by talking about how she had been a backer of Israel since her youth and then segued into the 'dire humanitarian situation' in Gaza.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris (right) met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) Thursday afternoon, telling reporters that the meeting was 'frank and constructive'\n\nHarris made rare remarks after a meeting with a world leader, as she's stepped up her role in the White House and the campaign trail this week as the Democrats' likely presidential nominee\n\n'From when I was a young girl, collecting funds to plant trees for Israel, to my time in the United States Senate and now at the White House, I've had an unwavering commitment to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security, and to the people of Israel,' Harris said.\n\n'I've said it many times, but it bears repeating: Israel has a right to defend itself,' she continued. 'And how it does so matters.'\n\nShe said she expressed to Netanyahu 'my serious concern about the scale of human suffering and Gaza including the death of far too many innocent civilians.'\n\n'And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there, with over two million people facing high levels of food insecurity and half a million people facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity,' Harris continued.\n\n'What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,' the vice president noted.\n\nAs the likely Democratic nominee, Harris has to take into account the thorny politics of the Gaza war with members of her party, as the progressive left has expressed outrage with how Palestinian civilians have been treated by IDF forces.\n\nPalestinian health authorities have estimated around 39,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since the war started in the aftermath of Hamas' brutal terror attack on Israel on October 7.\n\nHamas militants killed around 1,197 Israelis, mostly civilians, in that assault.\n\nDuring Netanyahu's address before Congress Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib held up a sign that read 'war criminal' on one side and 'guilty of genocide' on the other.\n\nThe White House has pushed back on terms like 'war criminal' and 'genocide.'\n\n'The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies,' Harris told reporters Thursday.\n\n'We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,' she said.\n\nShe then outlined what's on the table for there to be a ceasefire and for the Israelis to get their hostages back.\n\nBefore concluding her brief remarks, she asked Americans to view the war in shades of gray.\n\n'It is important for the American people to remember the war in Gaza is not a binary issue,' she stated. 'However, too often the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but.'\n\n'So I asked my fellow Americans to help encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the nuance, and the history of the region,' she continued. 'Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians and let us condemn anti-semitism, Islamophobia and hate of any kind.'\n\nIt's too early to tell if Harris' tough tone, but quest for nuance, will be enough to win back over the younger voters Biden was bleeding due to his support for Israel.\n\nThe 'uncommitted' movement saw Biden drained of around 101,000 potential votes in the key swing state of Michigan, as Democrats in the primary made that choice to express their displeasure with the president's foreign policy stance on Gaza.\n\nPrior to her new role as Democratic presidential candidate, Harris had already been more nuanced than Biden when discussing the war.\n\nIn March, she called for a ceasefire deal to end the 'immense suffering' of the Palestinians and was critical of Israel for insufficiently getting aid into Gaza.\n\nThis week she kept an event with the historically black Zeta Phi Beta sorority in Indiana on her schedule, instead of being in Washington for Netanyahu's congressional address.\n\nShe did, however, rush back from Houston - where she had addressed the American Federation of Teachers Thursday morning - for her afternoon meet-and-greet with the Israeli prime minister.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What Netanyahu's Washington visit means  --  RT World News", "body": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made his first trip abroad since the events of October 7, 2023, with an important visit to Washington, DC. His plane, known as the Wing of Zion, landed in the US capital on Monday, July 22.\n\nThe skies were clear that day, but the political atmosphere in Washington was not. The US has been experiencing challenging times, marked by deep societal divisions and a seeming departure from the foundational values established by the Founding Fathers.\n\nDuring his visit, Netanyahu faced strained relations with the Democratic Party. Many Democrats criticized his hardline stance on the Palestinian issue and allegations of corruption. These tensions were further heightened by Netanyahu's repeated attempts to align himself with Republicans, giving the impression that he sought to influence US domestic politics. Additionally, former President Donald Trump expressed disappointment in Netanyahu for publicly congratulating Joe Biden on his 2020 election victory, viewing it as an act of disloyalty. This visit underscored not only Netanyahu's efforts to strengthen US-Israeli ties but also highlighted the deep political divisions currently present within American society.\n\nNetanyahu's visit to the US had been planned well in advance, as part of ongoing diplomatic efforts. A month prior, on June 22, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant traveled to Washington. He held meetings with senior US officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The discussions covered security concerns along the Lebanese border, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, and its \"third phase\" that is supposed to follow the cessation of active hostilities in the enclave. The meetings also focused on defense cooperation between Israel and the US, a crucial element for the security of the Israeli state.\n\nThe situation in Gaza remains complex, causing significant tension in US-Israeli relations. The Israeli military continues operations to neutralize the threat posed by Hamas, often drawing criticism from the international community and segments of the American public. The Biden administration seeks to balance support for Israel with the need to provide humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians, sometimes leading to disagreements between the two nations. Nevertheless, the US and Israel continue to actively collaborate in defense and intelligence, a vital aspect of their strategic partnership. However, issues surrounding peaceful resolution, and the protection of Palestinian civilians remain contentious topics, complicating diplomatic relations.\n\nThe objectives of Netanyahu's visit extended far beyond those of his defense minister. Netanyahu aimed to use his meeting with Biden and an address before Congress to restore his image as a staunch defender of Israel and to strengthen his ties with the American political elite. His last visit to Washington, in September 2020, was marked by the signing of a peace agreement with the United Arab Emirates, a significant diplomatic achievement facilitated by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nThe scheduled meeting with Biden, however, was postponed due to the US president's Covid-19 infection, with no new date set. Netanyahu's agenda also included meetings with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is likely preparing for her presidential run, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Netanyahu also planned a meeting with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe primary goal of the visit, as stated by Israeli officials, was to appeal to American lawmakers for bipartisan support for Israel in its conflict with the Palestinian movement Hamas and other adversaries, including Iran and the \"axis of resistance.\" Amid political instability in Washington, Netanyahu sought to secure the backing of the US as a key ally in confronting anti-Israel forces.\n\nIn his address to Congress, Netanyahu sought to avoid confrontation with the Biden administration and emphasized the importance of supporting Israel. Despite some Democrats expressing intentions to boycott the speech due to Israel's actions in Gaza, and protests occurring outside the Capitol from both American activists and Israeli democracy supporters, Netanyahu received a warm welcome with standing ovations as he entered the chamber.\n\nHe began his speech by thanking all the participants and referring to the venue as the \"citadel of democracy.\" He then stated that the \"Iranian axis of terrorism\" opposes America, Israel, and their Arab friends, framing the conflict not as a clash of civilizations but as a battle of \"barbarians against civilization,\" and asserted that \"the US and Israel must stand together.\"\n\nHis speech was well-prepared, highlighting the \"brutality\" of Palestinian militant groups. Netanyahu brought with him members of the Israeli military fighting in Gaza, including representatives of the Ethiopian and Bedouin communities, to demonstrate that \"Muslims, Christians, and Jews\" are fighting together to defend Israel. He addressed the issue of civilian casualties, insisting that for Israel, \"the loss of civilian life is a tragedy, while for Hamas, it is a strategy.\" Netanyahu called for providing the Israeli Defense Forces with \"the necessary tools\" to achieve victory, implying a request for American military aid.\n\nAs expected, Netanyahu praised Biden and the Democrats for their friendship and support for democratic Israel, while also expressing gratitude to Trump and the Republicans for their support, including the recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory and Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nIn summary, Netanyahu's visit was aimed at securing support, resolving current disagreements between Washington and West Jerusalem, and ensuring backing from future US administrations. Additionally, this visit served to bolster Netanyahu's position within Israel, sending a message to the Israeli public that he maintains strong \"allied relations\" with the US, despite recent pressures.\n\nThe visit took place in a markedly different political landscape compared to the previous one. His government, the most conservative in Israel's history, has faced significant challenges, including the tragic events of October 7, which were the largest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Recent polls showed that 72% of Israelis want him to resign, either immediately or after the Gaza war is over. Despite the criticism and dissatisfaction, Netanyahu has retained power with a majority in the Knesset and avoided the threat of early elections.\n\nNetanyahu's visit to Washington occurred against a backdrop of global and regional shifts that could potentially be historic. Tensions on Israel's northern borders have escalated, with open conflict with Hezbollah becoming a daily reality as both sides exchange strikes. The \"axis of resistance\" also continues its attacks on Western military targets in the region and Israel, while another round of escalation has been observed between the IDF and the Yemeni Houthi movement, Ansar Allah.\n\nThe Houthis launched an attack on Tel Aviv with a new drone called Jaffa on the night of July 19, prompting Israel to strike various targets in the port city of Hodeidah, Yemen, according to the Israeli army's press office. The growing external threats are making it increasingly difficult for Israel to maintain security, with Netanyahu stating before his departure to Washington that Jerusalem was currently engaged in military actions on \"seven fronts.\"\n\nHowever, Israel itself has played a role in intensifying the situation. On July 18, the Israeli Knesset passed a resolution rejecting the creation of a Palestinian state, citing it as a threat to Israel's existence and its citizens. The resolution argued that establishing such a state on the West Bank would perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region. The authors of the resolution also claimed it would reward terrorism, bolstering Hamas and other radical forces.\n\nThe resolution was supported by Netanyahu's coalition parties, right-wing opposition parties, and the centrist National Unity party led by Benny Gantz. The left-centrist party Yesh Atid, headed by Yair Lapid, opposed the resolution, advocating for a two-state solution, and walked out of the session. This all unfolded as Netanyahu prepared for his US visit, fully aware that such a decision by the Knesset could strain US-Israel relations, given the Democratic Party's support for a two-state solution.\n\nMoreover, there were signs of progress in resolving disputes among various Palestinian factions. On July 23, 14 Palestinian factions concluded three-day talks in China, signing the Beijing Declaration on reconciliation. The document called for the formation of a temporary government of national unity under the PLO after the war's end. Signatories included Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Fatah. The main goal was to unite Palestinian institutions, hold general elections, and rebuild Gaza with support from Russia, China, and Algeria.\n\nChina, acting as a mediator, proposed a three-stage plan for resolving the Palestinian issue, including a ceasefire, reconstruction of Gaza, and full UN membership for Palestine. The Chinese side, represented by Foreign Minister Wang Yi, emphasized that Beijing had no selfish interests and supported the Palestinian people's restoration of their legitimate rights. However, optimism about the implementation of the agreements under the Beijing Declaration should be tempered, as similar efforts in 2022 in Algeria remained on paper.\n\nThus, Netanyahu's visit to the US was crucial for the Israeli government and the future of Israel. The times have indeed changed. Russia and China are actively expanding their influence in the Middle East, while Israel's main ally, the US, appears to be losing its grip. Iran and various anti-Israel forces are growing stronger, expanding their military capabilities, and the Palestinians seem to recognize the importance of uniting their efforts for a common future. Even within the US, the situation is not smooth, with Biden stepping out of the presidential race, an assassination attempt on Trump, and a lack of unity among Democrats regarding support for Kamala Harris as a candidate in the upcoming election.\n\nThe region has been in turmoil for ten months, with no end in sight to the ongoing conflict. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as the Houthi movement, are intensifying, and anti-government protests continue within the country. Unfortunately, these developments suggest that the Promised Land may be on the brink of its most challenging period since 1948. This sentiment was echoed by Netanyahu, as well as by Gallant during his own visit to Washington.\n\nThe US has been and will always remain Israel's most important ally, regardless of who occupies the Oval Office, as the protection of \"Israel's friends\" is paramount. The recent US military transport flights over Turkey to Syria and Iraq indicate that Washington is preparing for a worsening situation. However, the strength of support will largely depend on the election campaign and the outcome of the presidential election. However, Netanyahu seeks to assure both Democrats and Republicans that \"Israel and the US are allies forever.\" The citizens of Israel must also understand the importance of Netanyahu, as only he can protect them, and no one else has such strong and enduring ties with Washington, which will also help Israel.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [],

We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and will not be silent.\"\n\nThe meeting was the culmination of her first big election test less than a week after becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee in the presidential elections. In a matter of days, Harris has had to navigate a tricky electoral minefield embodied by Netanyahu's visit and protests throughout Washington.\n\nWhile Democrats have largely unified behind Harris this week, the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza already looms large over her nascent presidential campaign. Her meeting with Netanyahu encapsulated those challenges as she attempts to maintain a fragile Democratic coalition divided over Israel's nearly 10-month-long Gaza campaign. It's even bled over into her selection of a running mate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's unfettered military support for Israel's Gaza offensive under Netanyahu has sparked massive discontent among large swathes of the Democratic base, particularly young voters crucial to the party's success, with massive pro-Palestine protests sweeping college campuses last spring.\n\nThe war has complicated Democrats' attempts to hold onto the White House, and it remains to be seen whether -- and to what extent -- Harris will attempt to recalibrate Biden's Israel policy amid grassroots pressure from the party's base.\n\n\"I think she's going to express general support for Israel,\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, a prominent pro-Israel Jewish Democrat and Netanyahu critic from New York, told MSNBC on Wednesday. \"She's going to be somewhat less supportive than President Biden has been. And I think a large part of the Democratic party, especially the younger members of the party, want that.\"\n\nNadler was speaking after Netanyahu's address on Capitol Hill. Harris did not preside over the speech, although the vice president traditionally does so when foreign heads of state address Congress.\n\nShe instead attended a campaign event in Indiana that was scheduled before Biden dropped out of the race. Congress firmed up the date for Netanyahu's address in early June, a few days after Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) signed onto the Republican-initiated letter formally inviting the prime minister.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), also skipped Netanyahu's address to hit the campaign trail.\n\nAs senators, both Biden and Harris hewed closely to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. But some pro-Palestine advocates say they're cautiously optimistic that Harris will take a less hard-line position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than Biden did, even if they don't expect any immediate US policy changes.\n\n\"I do not think that what has transpired in the last 10 months could possibly have transpired under any other combination of leaders: Netanyahu on the one side and Biden on the other side,\" James Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute who previously served on the Democratic National Committee, told Al-Monitor. \"I can't imagine any Democrat that would have allowed this to go on.\"\n\nBiden's staunch support for Israel amid the decimation of Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre of Israelis has generated backlash among key components of the Democratic base, including young, Black and Hispanic voters. A campaign to vote \"uncommitted\" against Biden in the Democratic primary gained significant traction in multiple battleground states.\n\n\"Vice President Harris, from very early on, displayed to me in conversation that she had a different view,\" said Zogby. \"She is the vice president, and vice presidents don't break with their presidents. But she has said things that no one else in the administration has said and displayed an empathy and understanding that I have not seen from literally anyone else, including the national security adviser and the secretary of state.\"\n\nThe vice president's national security adviser, Phil Gordon, visited Israel in June as part of the Biden administration's push for a cease-fire deal. While there, he publicly highlighted Israel's growing isolation on the world stage and declining support among the American public.\n\n\"Israel is facing growing international criticism and pressure from the United Nations and other international bodies,\" said Gordon. \"Vocal segments of the American public have spoken out against the war in Gaza. As a result, over the past eight and a half months, the US-Israel partnership has been tested as perhaps never before.\"\n\nHarris also called for an \"immediate cease-fire\" in a March speech while calling on Israel to \"open new border crossings.\"\n\n\"They must not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the delivery of aid,\" she said. \"They must ensure humanitarian personnel, sites and convoys are not targeted.\"\n\nNBC subsequently reported that the National Security Council watered down parts of her speech that contained even harsher language about Israel regarding the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.\n\n\"We are cautiously optimistic that under a Harris administration she would be more receptive to the needs and concerns of the American people, at least with respect to the war in Gaza,\" Yasmine Taeb, the political director of the Muslim American MPower Change advocacy group and a former Democratic National Committee member, told Al-Monitor.\n\n\"We're obviously also cognizant of the fact that she will probably not be inclined to make any sort of drastic policy change prior to November,\" said Taeb. \"But there's a variety of ways for her to show that she's at least listening and receptive to those concerns. One is who she's going to choose as her running mate.\"\n\nTaeb's organization is urging Harris not to select popular Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as her running mate. MPower hosted a call with Muslim American leaders earlier this week who were voicing concerns about his role in cracking down on pro-Palestine demonstrators on Pennsylvania campuses last spring.\n\nShapiro -- widely considered a frontrunner to serve as Harris' running mate -- likened the protesters to the Ku Klux Klan in an April interview on CNN. He then called on the University of Pennsylvania in May to bring in police to disperse students protesting against US support for the Gaza war. The dispersal came amid violent police crackdowns on pro-Palestine student protesters across the country.\n\nBut Shapiro, who is Jewish, has also called Netanyahu \"one of the worst leaders of all time,\" accusing him of steering Israel in the \"wrong direction.\"\n\nEven as Netanyahu lambasted Americans protesting the Gaza war in his speech on Wednesday, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside Capitol Hill. While the protests remained largely peaceful, a contingent of demonstrators burned American flags and vandalized monuments outside Union Station with graffiti that included phrases like \"Hamas is coming.\"\n\nThe vandalism prompted Harris to issue a statement condemning the \"despicable acts of unpatriotic protesters and dangerous, hate-fueled rhetoric\" hours before her meeting with Netanyahu.\n\n\"I support the right to peacefully protest, but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation,\" said Harris.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Biden and Harris can convince Netanyahu and Hamas to finally end the war. In the meantime, Gaza still looms large over Harris' surprise presidential campaign, threatening to divide a fragile Democratic coalition that has rapidly coalesced around the vice president in less than a week.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters are still expected to demonstrate against the war outside of the Democratic National Convention in August.

But, she said, she discussed with Netanyahu her \"serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians.\"\n\nIn her remarks, Harris reiterated the deal proposed by Biden that would ultimately lead to a permanent end to the fighting, the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas, and a complete Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza. Earlier Thursday, John Kirby, the NSC spokesman, said \"gaps ... remain\" in the negotiations but \"we believe that they are of a nature that they can be closed.\"\n\nHarris said she told Netanyahu \"it is time to get this deal done.\"\n\nNetanyahu met earlier in the day with President Biden at the White House. His visit comes at a critical moment in American politics: with four months to the election, the White House is eager to secure a cease-fire deal to end Israel's war with Hamas, which began last October with the militant group's attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people.\n\nIsrael's response has killed 39,000 Palestinians, a significant proportion of them civilians, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. A potential deal to end the conflict will undoubtedly be a focus of Biden and Harris' meetings with Israel's leader as Gaza continues to remain a political liability for Democrats heading into a presidential election.\n\nHarris, who is now the likely Democratic presidential nominee, inherits this war as she attempts to maintain a delicate balancing act in a race where one misplaced word on the conflict can cost her support in key states that Democrats need to keep the White House.\n\n\"Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians,\" Harris said Thursday. \"And let us condemn anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and hate of any kind.\"\n\nShe is maintaining the administration's support of Israel and trying to not alienate supporters of the Jewish state, who make up a key Democratic constituency. But she is also expressing sympathy for Palestinian civilians killed in the conflict and trying to win back some of the young, progressive, Black and Brown voters whom Biden alienated with his response to the war.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,\" she said Thursday. \"The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.\"\n\nAs Biden's vice president, Harris has remained in lockstep with the president on policy, including his steadfast commitment to the security of Israel.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has gone even a step further in taking a leadership role in condemning the horrific sexual violence that was perpetrated by Hamas,\" said Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris in the Senate and now runs the Jewish Democratic Council of America.\n\n\"I attended an event at the White House just last month where she was the leading voice from the White House in drawing attention to Hamas's use of rape as a weapon of war on that horrific day,\" Soifer said.\n\nResponding to protesters who spray-painted pro-Hamas graffiti in Washington as a response to Netanyahu's visit, Harris said in a statement that while she supported the right to peacefully protest \"let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation.\"\n\nThough the substance of what Harris has said is similar to Biden, when she speaks about the conflict, the vice president differs in tone, particularly in describing what she has called the \"humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza.\n\nIn both public and private, Harris is seen to show a greater understanding and empathy for Palestinians, multiple people told NPR. And they say she's also shown greater empathy for protesters demonstrating against Israel's military operation.\n\n\"If you look at her public remarks about Gaza as vice president, unlike Biden, she really did manage to convey a much greater empathy and sympathy for the suffering of Palestinians,\" said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nFor some Democrats who voted 'uncommitted' during the presidential primaries as a way to protest Biden's policy, Harris' expressions of empathy has left them open to giving her a chance.\n\n\"If I had, for example, tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event and urged them to vote for Joe Biden, I would never be invited back. The anger was so deep. And the hurt was so deep -- even for me,\" said Georgia State Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Palestinian-American.\n\nBut Romman says she thinks people would be open to hearing from Harris and letting her make her case.\n\nWhile some Democrats would like to see Harris chart a new policy path, experts say it's highly unlikely that if she became president, Harris would break from decades of bipartisan consensus on Israel.\n\nStill, experts say she may be more open to strike a tone distinct from Biden's. \"She's a strongly, I would argue, pro-Israeli, moderate, mainstream Democrat,\" said Miller.\n\n\"But at the same time, she really doesn't have Biden's long history with Israel nor any of its leaders. And she's also from a different generation, which means she's going to put a greater focus, I think, on human rights, diversity, discrimination.\"\n\nAbdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, Mich., home to the largest Arab-American community in the U.S., voted uncommitted during the primaries.\n\nHe has said he felt betrayed by the administration, but now says he feels like there's an opportunity for Harris to \"course correct.\" He points out that a majority of Democrats disapproveof the Israeli military's actions in Gaza.\n\n\"Now, whether hope flourishes or dies, I really believe it's going to be dependent upon these next crucial weeks and the messages that come forward from Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign,\" Hammoud said. \"I think she has a real opportunity.\"\n\nCritics of Biden's Gaza policy aren't the only ones watching Harris' messages in the weeks ahead. Democrats are deeply divided on Israel, and Republicans are united in criticizing her. Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, on Friday, and Harris' views will almost certainly come up.\n\nThe vice president typically presides over joint addresses in Congress, but on Wednesday, she was not present for Netanyahu's remarks. Her team cited a scheduling conflict.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years from Golda Meir. So, from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.\"\n\nBiden answered, \"I look forward to as well. By the way, that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin. That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then. Anyway, thank you all for being here.\"\n\nBiden was referring to Yitzhak Rabin, who served as prime minister of Israel from 1974-1977 and again from 1992 until he was assassinated in 1995.\n\nANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS DESCEND ON WHITE HOUSE AS BIDEN MEETS WITH NETANYAHU\n\nBiden actually met with Meir and Rabin in 1973 when he was a 30-year-old senator, a story he's told frequently, three years ago incorrectly claiming he was a \"liaison\" between Israel and Egypt during the Six-Day War, which occurred in 1967 when he was still in law school.\n\n\"I have known every, every prime minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir,\" Biden said during a menorah lighting in 2021. \"And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to, she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez.\"\n\nHe actually met with Meir just prior to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\nHe added at the time: \"And I sat in front of her desk,\" he continued. \"And she had a guy, her staff member, to my right. His name was Rabin. And she kept flipping those maps up and down. She had that bevy of maps, sort of kept it, and it was, it was so depressing what she was, about what happened. She gave me every detail.\"\n\nBiden's team confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday that he was joking about his age.\n\nBoth leaders ignored reporters' shouted questions about a potential cease-fire and the anti-Israel protests after the brief meeting.\n\nNetanyahu's address to Congress on Wednesday tipped off anti-Israel protests in the capital, with some marching through the streets shouting \"Free Palestine\" and others waving Hamas flags, burning the American flag and painting graffiti.\n\nA Christopher Columbus statue outside Union Station was tagged with the warning: \"Hamas is coming.\"\n\nNetanyahu slammed the demonstrators during his address, calling them \"Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\nHARRIS BOYCOTTS NETANYAHU, SNUBS ISRAELI LEADER'S WARTIME ADDRESS TO GIVE SORORITY SPEECH\n\n\"I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nHe added, \"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming 'Gays for Gaza.' They might as well hold up signs saying 'Chickens for KFC.' These protesters chant 'From the river to the sea.' But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.\"\n\nHe addressed a nearly full House chamber, which included members of Congress and special guests like freed Israeli hostages who were taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 and billionaire Elon Musk, among others.\n\nAmong those in the chamber was Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Israel's harshest critic in the House of Representatives. Tlaib has called for Netanyahu to be arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC). She staged a silent protest for much of his speech, holding a double-sided sign that read \"guilty of genocide\" on one side and \"war criminal\" on the other.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS

What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,\" Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters in remarks after her meeting with Netanyahu in Washington.\n\n\"The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,\" she continued.\n\nHarris' comments provided the clearest explanation yet of her views on the conflict as she works to balance the issue that has not only divided the country but caused friction within the Democratic Party. Harris echoed Biden's repeated comments about America's \"ironclad support\" and \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel, but she conveyed a forcefulness on ending the war.\n\nRecalling the details of the proposed US-backed ceasefire and hostage deal, Harris said that \"it is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination.\"\n\nThe vice president said there has been \"hopeful movement\" in the talks and that she pushed the prime minister to bring the conflict to a close.\n\n\"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,\" she said. \"So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.\"\n\nThe Biden administration, Harris said, is working to bring home the American hostages in Gaza. The vice president, who has met with the families, listed the names of those being held by Hamas.\n\nIn a notable moment near the conclusion of her remarks, Harris told reporters that \"it is important for the American people to remember, the war in Gaza is not a binary issue.\"\n\n\"Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. And let us condemn antisemitism, islamophobia and hate of any kind. And let us work to unite our country,\" she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Aditi Sangal contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Today, we've also been reminded - again - that he's a patriot of the highest order,\" said former president Barack Obama.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said, \"He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents.\"\n\n\"I cannot overstate the gravity of the noble and history-making decision that President Biden just made,\" tweeted New Jersey Governor Cory Booker. \"The feeling that I have right now is one of profound gratitude. I am grateful that Joe Biden has been a friend, the most dedicated of public servants, and an extraordinary president.\"\n\n\"The framers of our Constitution knew that our republic would endure only if our presidents have the character and honor to put duty ahead of self-interest,\" said former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. \"President Biden deserves our gratitude for his decades of service to our nation and for his courageous decision today.\"\n\nCNN Van Jones started crying on the air after the announcement. \"You just cry, because this is someone that you love, this is somebody that you care about,\" he explained to viewers. \"This is somebody that was there for you. You wouldn't be here without him.\"\n\nAfter the President expanded on his decision in remarks to the American people on Wednesday night, former Biden advisor and MSNBC commentator Symone Sanders-Townsend tweeted, \"Again, we do not deserve Joe Biden.\"\n\nIt's not surprising that Democrats are praising a Democratic President or constructing a narrative of personal sacrifice as they head into a showdown with Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, it does raise some questions about Biden's actual legacy. When people look back on this era, will be the defining moment of his political story?\n\nMy guess would be no.\n\nWe've seen unspeakable terror rained down on the people of Gaza over the last ten months, and there's no end in sight. Addressing the U.S. Congress yesterday, Netanyahu vowed to keep dropping bombs on Palestine until \"total victory\" achieved. Hamas isn't close to being defeated, so there's no reason to believe that Israel's brutal strategy is about shift.\n\nIsrael has gotten everything it's wanted from the Biden administration throughout this ordeal. Biden temporarily paused a weapons shipment in May, to the horror of Republicans and hawkish Democrats, but The White House has done nothing to stop the atrocities or hold Israel accountable for them in any way.\n\nPeople like to say that every modern president is bad on Israel. Yes, that's obviously true. However, occasionally some action gets taken. George H.W. Bush holding up loans guarantees to stop settlements, Reagan standing up to Begin over the massacre in Lebanon, or Obama allowing a resolution condemning West Bank settlements to be adopted.\n\nYou can even find examples like this during the Biden years. In Franklin Foer's book on Biden, The Last Politician, he recounts Israel's 2021 assault on Gaza. Bibi wanted to keep bombing, but Biden instructed him to pull the plug.\n\n\"Hey, man, we are out of runway here,\" the President reportedly told Netanyahu. \"It's over.\"\n\nNetanyahu begrudgingly wrapped things up.\n\nThis anecdote says something profound about the power dynamic between the two countries, but it also proves that how much leverage Biden has.\n\nEvery few months there's a new story about how Biden is allegedly frustrated with Israel. He's mad at Netanyahu. He's talking stern to him during a phone call, or some such thing. Pundits wonder whether we are seeing the beginnings of a policy shift.\n\nEvery week a featureless State Department spokesman tells reporters that the U.S. government is looking into this calamity, or that monstrosity. They're talking to their partners. They're investigating. They're expressing their concerns to Israel. They don't have the information in front of them at this time, they wouldn't want to speak upon that issue right now. They're not going to get into specifics, they can't talk details. They condemn every act of violence. They believe in a two-state solution.\n\nHowever, nothing ever changes. No action is ever taken. None of the unspeakable videos or photos or testimonies has ever moved them to act.\n\nThe Lancet recently published a study estimating that the death toll in Gaza will reach at least 186,000.\n\nThat's Biden's legacy and it's how he should be remembered.\n\nThis week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint meeting of Congress.\n\nIt's the fourth time he's done this, a new record among world leaders. He was previously tied with Winston Churchill.\n\nThe sick speech didn't feature many surprises. Netanyahu tried to bolster support for his war by playing the usual hits: the evil of Hamas, the threat of Iran, and the need to preserve the special relationship between the United States and Israel.\n\nThere was one new element: an attack on pro-Palestine protestors. Netanyahu referred to them as \"Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\nNetanyahu didn't have to say that kind of stuff when he addressed congress in 2015 because there weren't tens of thousands of people in the streets demanding an end to to his violence and calling for him to be arrested for war crimes.\n\nHis visit to DC was marked by mass protests all around him. The Prime Minister's motorcade was forced to reroute after people blocked streets around the Capitol. Thousands stood in front of the Watergate, where he was staying, chanting in support of Gaza. A group of activists even dumped maggots on a conference table that was supposed to be used for one of his meetings at the hotel.\n\nYes the congressional members who attended this spectacle repeatedly gave Netanyahu standing ovations, but nearly half the Democrats skipped. Some very big names, like Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and former House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) stayed away. Some lawmakers cited scheduling conflicts, others made it well-known that they were boycotting.\n\n\"By bestowing Prime Minister Netanyahu with a joint address, Congress is not only continuing to green-light genocide; it is actively celebrating the man at the forefront of that genocide,\" said Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO). \"Instead of platforming a war criminal, Congress should be imposing an arms embargo and using its leverage to force Netanyahu to end the bombing and bloodshed that has already killed over 39,000 Palestinians and failed to ensure the safe release of the vast majority of hostages, all while decimating schools, hospitals, homes, and humanitarian convoys.\"\n\nIn 2015, around 50 Democrats didn't show for Netanyahu's speech. This time it was about 136. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) held up a sign while Bibi spoke that said, \"War Criminal.\" The other side said, \"Guilty of Genocide.\"\n\nNetanyahu's brand has diminished over the past decade, and by extension so has Israel's. The speech was awful, but the reaction shows that popular opinion has changed in this country.\n\nOn the day of Netanyahu's speech more than 40 Palestinians were killed by indiscriminate airstrikes in Khan Younis. The carnage continues, as does the opposition.\n\n\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 Pro-Palestine orgs and lawmakers react to Biden dropping out\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Biden staffers who resigned over Gaza say US has destroyed international law and endangered Americans\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 Looking at Kamala Harris's record on Israel\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 The Guardian: I worked to elect Kamala Harris.

In his remarks, Netanyahu argued that the current conflicts and the dangers in the Middle East -- from Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran -- are not just issues that threaten the safety and security of Israel, but existential threats to Western stability and institutions. Netanyahu, borrowing a framework from my former teacher, Harvard Professor Samuel Huntington, declared that what the world is facing now is \". . . not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between barbarism and civilization. It's a clash between those who glorify death and those who sanctify life.\"\n\nSadly, these powerful words were missed by many Congressional Democrats who refused to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress and will not listen to, or even consider, the Prime Minister's valuable ideas. While one can disagree with Israel's approach to self-defense, Netanyahu's larger point on the global order should not be ignored.\n\nNetanyahu reaffirmed the power and salience of the American-Israeli relationship, stressing the deep ties between the Western democracies: \"My friends, if you remember nothing else from this speech, remember this: Our enemies are your enemies, our fight is your fight, and our victory will be your victory.\" He emphasized that Hamas and its allies are not looking to destroy Israel alone, but rather upend the liberal order. Because of these terrorist organizations, we must defend our \"common civilization\" based on \"dignity, prosperity, and peace.\" The protests that have flared up around the country since October 7 visibly prove Netanyahu's point: The protesters are calling for far more than the destruction of Israel and harm to Jews. The protesters are violent and threatening, and they are explicitly calling for the downfall of America's institutions and attacking our core values -- from free markets to the American Dream -- as well.\n\nRather than listening to Netanyahu's unifying message, leftist protestors outside the Capitol burned American flags and an effigy of the Israeli Prime Minister. They assaulted and threatened police and vandalized the Freedom Bell -- a monument to Philadelphia's Liberty Bell that has absolutely nothing to do with Israel or Hamas. Those on the left had nothing but shame to throw at Netanyahu after his speech, ignoring his larger point about Western liberalism and the message of the vandalism in DC and instead focused on the war, pronouncing that the Prime Minister had \"lost America.\" Former House Speaker Nany Pelosi stated, \"Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation in the House Chamber today was by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress of the United States.\" Pelosi disagreed with his position on how to defend Israel and manage hostages and unleashed a bitter attack echoed in other news outlets with headlines like, \"Netanyahu is out of touch with reality.\"\n\nThe left-wing media bias is on full display. The irony is that those who are calling Netanyahu out of touch are themselves out of touch with where Americans stand on Israel. A summer poll conducted by the Center for American Politics Studies at Harvard reveals that 80 percent of Americans support Israel over Hamas. Roughly 62 percent of those surveyed believe Israel is trying to avoid civilian casualties -- a central claim made by Netanyahu in his address. Americans also do not want a simple ceasefire; they -- like Israel -- want a proper end to this conflict. As such, two-thirds (67 percent) of Americans, like Netanyahu, support a ceasefire only after the release of all hostages and the removal of Hamas from power. An overwhelming 82 percent of Americans agree with Netanyahu that Hamas as an existential threat which cannot continue and must be fully removed from running Gaza. Americans are supportive of Israel's actions to protect itself and the political and media elite as peddling falsehoods.\n\nNetanyahu is not out of touch with reality. Rather, the media finds itself misrepresenting America's views on the war in Israel. Beyond war tactics, Americans would be well served to take Netanyahu's larger point to heart. There are nations and terror groups scattered throughout the world that are organized and funded and want to remake the world order to undermine democracy. The violence that we see around the nation and in Europe related to Israel shows that this battle is far bigger than Israel itself; Hamas and its supporters are trying to create chaos and disruptions. America's leadership and leaders of democracies globally should be ready for an explosion of violence come this fall; a coalition of Hamas-allied groups just called for more action in New York alone: \"CUNY4Palestine, Within Our Lifetime, and National Students for Justice in Palestine call for a Week of Rage.\" Netanyahu is right, we are heading into a global clash between barbarism and civilization.

A May draft of a tentative cease-fire agreement that Israel had submitted would require its forces to withdraw from part of the corridor and allow unarmed people to cross it, permitting many displaced Gazans to return home.\n\nBut earlier this month, Mr. Netanyahu's government reversed its position, and pushed to install Israeli checkpoints throughout the corridor to screen for weapons, the officials say.\n\nLast week, Israeli news media reported that the Israeli defense minister and the head of the intelligence agency Mossad told cabinet ministers at a meeting that the demand would at the least delay a deal for releasing hostages, if not doom it altogether. But Mr. Netanyahu is also facing pressure from far-right religious parties that have threatened to dissolve his tenuous coalition government if Israeli forces withdraw from some parts of Gaza.\n\nAt least some senior Israeli security officials are banking on Mr. Biden to convince Mr. Netanyahu to stick to the earlier plan to allow Palestinians to pass through the Netzarim corridor without being screened for weapons, according to two people familiar with the internal conversations. They hope it will be among the sticking points in the negotiations that are raised at a White House meeting on Thursday afternoon between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Biden.\n\nA spokesman for the Israeli prime minister's office did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior U.S. administration official who briefed reporters on the planned meeting between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Biden said the talks between Israel and Hamas militants for a cease-fire and hostage deal were \"in the closing stages.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronen_bergman@nytimes.com", "name": "Ronen Bergman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lara_jakes@nytimes.com", "name": "Lara Jakes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netzarim", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netzarim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Netzarim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/25mideast-crisis-cease-fire-talks-zlfp/25mideast-crisis-cease-fire-talks-zlfp-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Fractured voters are watching | CBC News", "body": "Virtually every speaker addressing thousands of protesters rallying Wednesday against U.S. involvement in the Israel-Hamas war carried harsh words for U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOne also carried a word of warning for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"We're not going to give her a pass,\" said community organizer and socialist presidential nominee Claudia De la Cruz, as the crowd cheered in agreement blocks away from the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n\nHarris, who is favoured to become the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden bowed out of the race, met with Netanyahu on Thursday in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She was expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped by Hamas militants during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war.\n\n\"We have a lot to talk about,\" Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader.\n\n\"We do indeed,\" he replied.\n\nThe meeting was seen as the vice-president's first chance to distinguish herself from the Biden administration, but political scientists say she has to tread carefully to balance a Democratic base fractured by one of the most divisive foreign policy issues of the campaign.\n\nA senior administration official, who spoke with reporters Wednesday on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is \"no daylight between the president and vice president\" on the Israel file.\n\nIt's true that Harris and Biden have been in lockstep from a policy perspective -- Harris has repeatedly upheld Israel's \"right to defend itself\" against Hamas and emphasized that the threat it poses to Israel must be \"eliminated.\"\n\nBut she has taken a sharper tone than Biden when it comes to human suffering in Gaza.\n\nIn a high-profile civil rights speech in Selma, Ala., in March, she became the first senior leader in the Biden administration to call for an immediate -- though temporary -- ceasefire. She also described conditions in the Gaza Strip as a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nIn remarks after what she called a \"frank and constructive meeting\" with Netanyahu Thursday, Harris said she supports Israel's right to defend itself, but noted that \"how it does so matters.\"\n\nShe expressed concern over the \"devastating\" humanitarian situation in Gaza and images of civilians killed in the conflict, saying, \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.\"\n\nAaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former U.S. State Department peace negotiator, says there will be differences in Harris's approach to the file because she and Biden are fundamentally different people from different generations.\n\n\"She's married to a Jewish man -- who's staunchly pro-Israel -- and she herself is a moderate, mainstream Democrat ... she's not Joe Biden. She doesn't have that history that goes back decades with almost every single Israeli prime minister,\" Miller told CBC's The Current on Thursday.\n\n\"She focuses more on human rights and diversity, on anti-discrimination. She and her public comments over the last year have been pretty tough-minded,\" he said, but noted that she's going to have to function in what he calls \"the U.S.-Israeli operating system.\"\n\nOn one hand, Miller said, Harris's war policy needs to appeal to the Democratic Party's Jewish- American base. On the other, she needs to galvanize younger, diverse voters who staunchly oppose the war at large -- including those who stayed away or voted uncommitted during primaries in Michigan, a key battleground state with a significant Arab-American population.\n\n\"It's a delicate balancing act, and I think she can do it without major policy changes,\" said Jon Allen, a senior fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Canadian ambassador to Israel and Spain.\n\n\"I think what you're going to hear is a different tone and some different words.\"\n\nThe Uncommitted Campaign implored primary voters who were unhappy with the Biden-Harris administration's war policy to instead vote \"uncommitted\" in March to give party leadership \"a warning of the electoral reality they face in November if they don't change course\" on the Gaza file.\n\nThe organization said it was \"relieved\" to see Biden leave the race and noted it will be watching Harris's next steps closely.\n\n\"We know the stakes are high in this election and that is why we started this campaign -- to save lives and put the Democratic party in the best position to earn the votes to defeat Trump,\" said Democratic strategist and movement co-founder Waleed Shahid, speaking in a TikTok post Wednesday.\n\nThe three experts interviewed by CBC News agreed the war in Gaza will not be a make-or-break issue in the election for Harris.\n\nThey believe voters will be watching her more closely on domestic issues like the economy, immigration, climate, reproductive rights and the future of American democracy.\n\nTrump will meet with Netanyahu on Friday. In an interview with Fox News the day prior, Trump called for the return of hostages and \"a quick end\" to the war with Hamas.\n\nExperts believe Trump isn't likely to use the conflict as an opportunity to attack Harris, instead challenging her on the same slate of domestic priorities.\n\n\"He's been ... more critical than I expected of the war in Gaza,\" said Allen. \"I don't see him wanting to use this as a big stick.\"\n\nDespite its potential to fade behind issues closer to home, political scientists say Harris should take the war file seriously knowing voters in key swing states could decide who becomes the next American president.\n\nMatthew Grossman, the director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University, noted that while Gaza and other foreign policy concerns haven't been the most important issues for most voters, that doesn't mean they aren't important to critical constituencies like Michigan.\n\n\"The campaign is certainly acting like it is critical and they're treating it as such.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years from Golda Meir. So, from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel. And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead on the great issues before us.\"\n\nBiden answered, \"I look forward to as well. By the way, that first meeting with Prime Minister Golda Meir, she had an assistant sitting next to me, a guy named Rabin. That's how far back it goes. I was only 12 then. Anyway, thank you all for being here.\"\n\nBiden was referring to Yitzhak Rabin, who served as prime minister of Israel from 1974-1977 and again from 1992 until he was assassinated in 1995.\n\nANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS DESCEND ON WHITE HOUSE AS BIDEN MEETS WITH NETANYAHU\n\nBiden actually met with Meir and Rabin in 1973, when he was a 30-year-old senator, a story he's told frequently. Three years ago, he incorrectly claimed he was a \"liaison\" between Israel and Egypt during the Six-Day War, which occurred in 1967, when he was still in law school.\n\n\"I have known every, every prime minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir,\" Biden said during a menorah lighting in 2021. \"And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to, she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez.\"\n\nHe actually met with Meir just prior to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n\n\"And I sat in front of her desk,\" he added at the time. \"And she had a guy, her staff member, to my right. His name was Rabin. And she kept flipping those maps up and down. She had that bevy of maps, sort of kept it, and it was, it was so depressing what she was, about what happened. She gave me every detail.\"\n\nBiden's team confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday he was joking about his age.\n\nBoth leaders ignored reporters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shouted questions about a potential cease-fire and the anti-Israel protests after the brief meeting.\n\nNetanyahu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address to Congress Wednesday led to anti-Israel protests in the capital, with some marching through the streets shouting \"Free Palestine\" and others waving Hamas flags, burning the American flag and painting graffiti.\n\nA Christopher Columbus statue outside Union Station was tagged with the warning \"Hamas is coming.\"\n\nNetanyahu slammed the demonstrators during his address, calling them \"Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\nHARRIS BOYCOTTS NETANYAHU, SNUBS ISRAELI LEADER'S WARTIME ADDRESS TO GIVE SORORITY SPEECH\n\n\"I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n\"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gays for Gaza.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They might as well hold up signs saying \u00e2\u0080\u0098Chickens for KFC.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 These protesters chant \u00e2\u0080\u0098From the river to the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.\"\n\nHe addressed a nearly full House chamber, which included members of Congress and special guests like freed Israeli hostages who were taken by Hamas Oct. 7 and billionaire Elon Musk, among others.\n\nAmong those in the chamber was Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Israel's harshest critic in the House of Representatives. Tlaib has called for Netanyahu to be arrested by the International Criminal Court. She staged a silent protest for much of his speech, holding a double-sided sign that said \"guilty of genocide\" on one side and \"war criminal\" on the other.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS

I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term, but nothing -- nothing -- can come in the way of saving our democracy.

This consistency is a testament to his genuine belief in the importance of the US-Israel alliance rather than a matter of political expediency.\n\nEven in times of disagreement, such as during the recent judicial reform debate in Israel, Biden's fundamental support for Israel's security and well-being never wavered. His swift action in flying to Israel at the outbreak of the latest Israel-Hamas War, his efforts to create a multi-national security umbrella for Israel, and his diplomatic support on the international stage all demonstrate his unwavering commitment.\n\nBiden's self-description as a \"Christian Zionist\" speaks volumes about his personal conviction in Israel's right to exist and thrive. This belief has translated into tangible support, from military aid to tireless efforts in hostage negotiations.\n\nSome have said in recent months that his support for Israel is waning in the face of Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip. I simply do not believe that is the case.\n\nMany people were opposed to a Rafah operation, both in the US as well as in Israel, not to mention the rest of the world. This includes steadfast Zionists who did not want to see Israel further pushing into the Palestinian territory that is the coastal enclave out of concern that its justification for war would be turned on its head once the civilian-to-terrorist mortality rate became too overwhelming to argue for proportionality.\n\nBiden was always a Zionist, even while he was arguing against a Rafah operation and announcing that the US would not be providing Israel with weapons should the operation expand into Rafah. Just like those fighting in the streets for a ceasefire, he was fighting for the rights of civilians while simultaneously attempting to defend Israel's moral high ground.\n\nAs we bid farewell to President Biden's tenure, it is crucial to acknowledge the immense value of having such a steadfast friend in the White House. His legacy of support for Israel will undoubtedly be remembered as a cornerstone of his foreign policy achievements.\n\nTo President Biden, as you prepare to step down from the world stage, Israel and its supporters worldwide say thank you. Your half-century of dedication to the US-Israel relationship has made an indelible mark on history and will be remembered with profound appreciation for future generations.\n\nTo Donald Trump, the Republican candidate and former US president -- who, according to recent polls, is expected to win the elections -- do not make Israel's war against Hamas a campaign for your own personal gain.\n\nThis self-righteousness was perfectly visible five days after Israel experienced a massacre on its land when Trump said on Fox News that under him as president, Israel \"wouldn't have had to be prepared\" for the attack.\n\nAnd one more side-point, Trump: It doesn't look too hot when you say you cannot believe there are Jews who vote Democrat. You're not exactly winning any votes there.\n\nTo Kamala Harris: If you have any chance at all of winning, it is by way of being steadfast in your not-so-unequivocal support for the Jewish state. Your lack of stable stances is what makes Democrats hesitant. Let Israel be the platform upon which you prove that you are immovable in your values.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. And to the rest: May the odds be ever in your favor.\n\nThe writer is deputy editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Post.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_exist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to exist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golda Meir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jerusalem Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/611972", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764144", "eventUri": "eng-9764144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed \"total victory\" against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,\" Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. \"And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.\"\n\nNetanyahu met separately earlier in the day with Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire.\n\nHarris said after her meeting with Netanyahu that Israel's war in Gaza is more complicated than simply being supportive of one side or the other.\n\n\"Too often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris also condemned Hamas' brutality. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel.\n\nKirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed \"but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise.\"\n\nWith Harris' forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,\" Harris said. \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.\"\n\nThousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nAhead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel.\n\nShe's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel and installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington -- her husband is Jewish. She also has connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street.\n\nFor Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel.\n\nHarris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nThe conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service.\n\n\"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Biden.\n\nA U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.\n\nFollowing their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages.\n\nJonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said the families received an \"ironclad commitment\" from Biden and Netanyahu to get the deal done. He said he was more hopeful than at anytime since Hamas released more than 100 hostages during a temporary cease-fire in November.\n\n\"There is more reason today than in any time since the last round of hostage releases that something can happen,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas.\n\nIn his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel's conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping \"Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,\" Netanyahu said. \"Our fight, it's your fight. And our victory will be your victory. \"\n\nNetanyahu also derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran's \"useful idiots.\"\n\nHarris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nProtesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counterprotesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders.\n\n-- -\n\nAP writer Ashraf Khalil contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news",

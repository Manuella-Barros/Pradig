Alexander, number 46, played defence for the Roughriders from 1995 to 1998. He played 48 games, recording 68 tackles and 12 sacks. \u201cI absolutely love (the) Saskatchewan Roughriders. I love that organization. I love what they stand for, across our nation.\u201d Alexander got his start in football at age 16 in Edmonton, playing for his high school. Even though Alexander grew up in Alberta, he finds the Saskatchewan prairies beautiful and holds a special place for the province in his heart. \u201cWhen we flew in, I remember seeing the prairies and the plains and I guess, how people would look at the desert, or they\u2019d look at the ocean, or they\u2019d look at the boreal forest. I just thought it was absolutely beautiful.\u201d Alexander can even credit the Roughriders for helping him find his wife due to a PR event. \u201cMy real little brother was a part of the Big Brothers Association, and he had a fundraiser at a gym, and the Roughriders came,\u201d said Mia Alexander, Troy\u2019s wife. Alexander said Mia quickly caught his eye. \u201cI saw her and, and, you know, I\u2019m a big romantic, so I was very interested, but I was in the friend zone for a while. And fast forward to (when) she said she liked me, and then now we\u2019re here,\u201d Alexander said. Mia has been a lifelong Riders fan, but, to her, he was just like everyone else. \u201cHe\u2019s so down to earth and like, that\u2019s his job. It\u2019s not who he is. So, it was kind of easy to almost forget that he played football sometimes when we were together,\u201d Mia explained. Alexander created a brotherhood with not only the people he played football with but also those he works with every day saving lives. Ryan McKinley has been a co-worker of Alexander\u2019s at the Strathcona County Fire Department for over 20 years and says the two are like brothers. \u201cI think the team aspect \u2026 on a football field or on a court, the fire hall is no different in that regard.\u201d McKinley said the two lean on each other and that he trusts Alexander with his life. \u201cI think that adds to that special bond that you create in the fire hall where you can hash out ideas and thoughts and work through it,\u201d McKinley said. McKinley added that he is not the only one who has created a special bond with Alexander due to his kind nature. \u201cHe adapts to whatever situation he\u2019s in, and that\u2019s what makes him a great leader in our department. And it makes him a great friend as well. He\u2019s there for people and people have called him when there is really, really tough times going on. They\u2019ve leaned on Troy pretty heavily.\u201d Mia added that Troy is living a dream come true. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty lucky. He\u2019s had two jobs that a lot of little kids look and say, \u2018Oh my gosh, those would be dream jobs.\u2019 And he\u2019s gotten to do two of them.\u201d Alexander is grateful and proud of what he has accomplished and where his life has taken him. \u201cIt was definitely one of those experiences that I can\u2019t say completely shaped my life, but it was so special,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cYou never know where your life\u2019s going to take you, and, we are living proof,\u201d Mia added. He is a father of two girls and finds joy in spending time with them and the community he has built between his professions.", "summary": "One former Roughrider made the leap from tackling players to tackling fires \u2013 and he says the two aren't so different.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10544762/troy-alexander-former-roughrider-where-is-he-now/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:39", "author": "Destiny Meilleur", "authors": ["Destiny Meilleur"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.43}

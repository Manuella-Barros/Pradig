in the third round of the 152nd Open as Thriston Lawrence threatened to make more history at Royal Troon.\n\nKim was two over par after 16 holes but walked off the 17th back to level for the day after his tee shot pitched just short of the green and rolled inexorably into the cup on the 238-yard par three.\n\nIt is the first time a hole-in-one has been recorded on the 17th in 10 Open Championships at the South Ayrshire venue.\n\nBefore the forecast rain duly arrived, conditions had been perfect for scoring and Lawrence was taking full advantage, the South African making birdies on the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth to surge through the field.\n\nLawrence frustratingly left a birdie attempt short from 12 feet on the ninth, but still reached the turn in 30 and picked up another shot on the 11th.\n\nAt seven under par for the day, Lawrence needed to play his remaining seven holes in two under par for a 62 to equal the lowest score ever recorded in a men's major.\n\nThe course record of 63 was set by Phil Mickelson in the first round of the 2016 Open and equalled in the final round by champion Henrik Stenson.\n\nA roller coaster week for Justin Thomas continued as he covered the front nine in 31, a remarkable 14-shot improvement on Friday.\n\nThomas, who had been third after an opening 68, limped to the turn in 45 in round two with a triple bogey, double bogey and four bogeys on his card, but came home in 33 to make the cut with two shots to spare.\n\nThomas picked up his sixth birdie of the day on the 12th, but dropped shots at the 13th and the 15th as the weather worsened.\n\nIreland's Shane Lowry took a two-shot lead over England's Justin Rose and Dan Brown into the third round, with the final pair of Lowry and Brown not teeing off

He landed his tee shot on the long par-3 17th just short of the green, and it ran up and in perfectly.

Something that seemed nearly impossible was made to look easy by Kim on Saturday.\n\nThe announcers on various broadcasts couldn't believe it when Kim's ball rolled into the hole.\n\n\"No you can't, not at 17,\" the Open's official broadcast stated.\n\n\"Look at this,\" Steve Sands and the NBC crew said. \"That was the roar we heard earlier! A hole in one for Si Woo Kim.\"\n\nKim finished even for the third round, keeping his total score at 5 over. He's currently tied for 52nd at the Open.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Si Woo Kim Becomes First Golfer to Hit a Hole in One at 17 at Royal Troon in Open History.", "source": {"uri": "centredaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Centre Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madison_williams@centredaily.com", "name": "Madison Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Si-woo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Si-woo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/j9x7g5/picture290261834/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/c59e975e-c7ef-4067-baff-a1be6a01dba2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749598", "eventUri": "eng-9749598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

And perhaps more impressively, Hole 17, famously known as \"Rabbit\" is widely considered \"one of the more difficult short holes\" on the course per Royal Troon's website.\n\nREQUIRED READING: British Open 2024 live updates: Shane Lowry at the top as leaders' tee times draw near\n\nAccording to the PGA, it is the fifth ace of Kim's career on the PGA Tour. His first hole-in-one came during his first round at the 2016 Travelers Championship on Hole 5 at TPC River Highlands Golf Course in Cromwell, Connecticut. It is the first hole-in-one for Kim since the 2021 Sanderson Farms Championship, where he recorded an ace on Hole 7 at the Country Club of Jackson during his fourth round.\n\nIt is the second straight ace at The Open in recent years as Travis Smyth recorded one last year at Royal Liverpool, ironically also on Hole 17.\n\nAs things stand, Kim is currently tied for 50th place at The Open at 5-over par. In part to a strong back nine, Kim shot an even 71 on Saturday, which also included four birdies on the day.\n\nFourth-round coverage of the 152nd Open will start at 4 a.m. ET on Sunday, July 21 on USA Network before shifting over to NBC from 7 a.m. ET to 2 p.m. ET.

One perfect thump of his three-iron later, the South Korean made history.\n\nThe four-time PGA Tour winner struck the first hole-in-one ever recorded on the 17th hole during the major at the fabled Scottish course, acing from 238 yards to light up the end of his third round.\n\nNicknamed \"Rabbit\", the par-three has garnered a reputation for being one of the course's most menacing challenges across the 10 Opens hosted at Royal Troon since 1923.\n\nPlaying as the sixth hardest hole during the second round, a sharply sloping green guarded by four deep bunkers makes leaving with par \"gold,\" according to tournament organizers.\n\nThat was more than Si-woo had managed before Saturday, having double bogeyed and bogeyed the 17th hole across his opening two rounds. Imagine his shock then, when the shrieks of the crowds gathered by the green rippled back up the fairway.\n\n\"I went back to the bag and there were people yelling at me ... I didn't realize the ball had gone in,\" Si-woo later told reporters.\n\n\"I've had plenty of holes-in-one in my life ... but I think this is the most memorable.\"\n\nIt marked the longest hole-in-one in recorded history at the major (since 1980), according to golf statistician Justin Ray, bettering Frank Lickliter II's 212-yard ace at Royal Lytham and St Anne's fifth hole in 2001.\n\n\"That is perfection ... what a treat,\" three-time Open champion Nick Faldo cooed on the Sky Sports broadcast.\n\n\"He'll frame the ball but he won't frame the shirt,\" he added.\n\nSi-woo followed up his eagle with a closing par to card an even-par 71, keeping him at five-over overall for the week.\n\nA mammoth 12 strokes behind clubhouse leader Shane Lowry before the Irishman teed off for his third round, the South Korean's hopes of a first major title this week are all but over, but his hole-in-one lifted the gloom on a frustrating week.\n\n\"I was not doing very well, I was feeling terrible for my shot the last couple days,\" the 2017 Players Championship winner said.\n\n\"Then finally I got the best golf shot I've ever had this week. That goes in and that makes it more special, especially at the major and The Open here.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Despite being described by many as the most popular women\u2019s basketball player in the country, the Indiana Fever star will not appear on Team USA\u2019s roster, according to reports from The Athletic, USA Today and ESPN. Rather than the star rookie \u2014 who is known to draw record crowds and TV audiences \u2014 the U.S. Olympic women\u2019s basketball roster will consist almost entirely of Olympic veterans, The Athletic reported. Team USA taken home the gold every four years since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. USA Basketball did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. The 12-person lineup will reportedly include A\u2019ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Diana Taurasi, Alyssa Thomas, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd, Kelsey Plum, Jackie Young, Sabrina Ionescu, Chelsea Gray, Kahleah Copper and Brittney Griner. The roster is selected by the women\u2019s basketball committee, which includes Dawn Staley. Only three players on the reported roster \u2014 Thomas, Copper and Ionescu \u2014 will head to Paris as first-time Olympians, per the outlet. And, notably, the event will mark Griner\u2019s first time playing internationally since her 10-month detainment in Russia. Meanwhile, Clark will likely be a Team USA alternate, along with players Brionna Jones and Aliyah Boston. Although, The Athletic reported, no official alternates are expected to be publicly disclosed ahead of the Games. The Athletic also noted that while lots of WNBA vets attended the U.S. national team\u2019s final training camp ahead of the Summer Olympics in March, Clark did not. The star player was one of 14 players to receive an invitation, but she was unable to attend as she was wrapping up her historic college career with the Iowa Hawkeyes, who were in the Final Four of the March Madness tournament at the time. Concern over Clark\u2019s fans\u2019 reaction to potentially limited playing time at the Paris event was also a factor in the decision making, USA Today reported.

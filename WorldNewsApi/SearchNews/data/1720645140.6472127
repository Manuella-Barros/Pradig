She would not have tried to form the next govt if she were in Modi\u2019s shoes, she said.\u201cWe are waiting and watching the situation. We will be happy if this unstable, tottering, and weak government, which has nothing to offer to people, returns home quickly and starts their meditations and penance. INDIA will keep its commitment to people,\u201d the CM said.Banerjee said Trinamool Congress would not join Modi\u2019s swearing-in ceremony in Delhi on Sunday. Indicating that there was no invite, she said, \u201cNa eshche na jabeh (no invite has come, neither will anyone go). This government is undemocratic, unconstitutional and illegal... I cannot wish them well. My wishes are for the people and the country\u2026 let us hope for the best. People did not vote for them.\u201d She added that after such a big loss, the right thing \u201cfor Modi Babu\u201d would have been to leave the PM\u2019s chair for someone else.The CM also supported INDIA bloc partners on several issues. She repeated Congress MP Rahul Gandhi\u2019s allegation about a \u201cstock market scam\u201d and said a Trinamool delegation, led by Rajya Sabha senior Derek O\u2019Brien would visit Haryana to express solidarity with the state\u2019s farmers. Banerjee also invited INDIA alliance partners to visit Bengal saying, \u201cIf they want to organise any meeting in Kolkata, I welcome all of them.\u201dThe meeting in Kalighat on Saturday started with a resolution thanking \u2018Ma Mati Manush\u2019. \u201cWe thank those who voted for us and also those who did not. Voting is a personal choice, but we hope the peace and unity with which Bengal is moving ahead will continue,\u201d Banerjee said. She also congratulated \u201cgiant-killer Yusuf Pathan\u201d for defeating Congress state chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in his bastion (Behrampore) and admitted that at one point she was anxious about the wins of Mahua Moitra (Krishnanagar) and Rachna Banerjee (Hooghly).She, however, alleged that the Election Commission had manipulated results in some seats to help BJP, particularly in East Midnapore where \u201cthere was total loot\u201d and rued that only one of the 12 women fielded by her party lost (Sujata Mondal in Bishnupur by just 5,567 votes) due to the machinations of the EC.The CM said Trinamool\u2019s first demand from the new govt at Centre would be to repeal NRC and demanded that the district magistrate\u2019s power to probe and grant citizenship based on appeals be reinstated. She also said that Centre should immediately clear the state\u2019s dues. \u201cDo not consider us weak. Trinamool is the third largest party. In Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha we have 42 MPs,\u201d she added.", "summary": "West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee  said that the INDIA bloc\u2019s decision not to stake any claim to form the govt today does not mean that it is not going to stake claim tomorrow, adding that TDP\u2019s Chandrababu Naidu and JD(U)\u2019s Nitish Kumar \u201care also our friends\u201d.

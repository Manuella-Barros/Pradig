He is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who qualified for the Indiana ballot before she dropped out two months ago, has not endorsed Trump.\n\nA Haley campaign adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the results.\n\nIndiana Democrats did not have the option to vote \" uncommitted \" in their party primary. Unease about President Joe Biden\u00b4s handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a protest vote movement in some states, raising similar questions about the strength of his support in November.\n\nHaley\u00b4s support was largest in Indiana\u00b4s urban and suburban counties. She won 35% of the vote in Indianapolis\u00b4s Marion County and more than one-third of the vote in suburban Hamilton County. As in other states, she did best in the most Democratic areas of the state.\n\nThe exception was Lake County, home to Gary, just south of Chicago. Haley won only 14% of the vote in Lake County.\n\nBiden\u00b4s campaign attributed Haley\u00b4s Indiana showing to Trump\u00b4s trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Pennsylvania, Haley received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIn late January, Trump said prematurely that Haley did not have enough signatures to make Indiana\u00b4s primary ballot. While Haley did get the minimum 500 signatures needed in each congressional district to make the ballot, the margin was razor thin in the 7th District, which includes Indianapolis.\n\nHaley\u00b4s campaign was largely absent from the state even while she was in the race.\n\nIndiana, with its 11 electoral votes, is far from the swing state that Pennsylvania is. Trump won Indiana by 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nNonetheless, Haley's support from 1 in 5 Republican voters raises questions about how they will vote in the fall. Before she dropped out, she took nearly 27% of votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nHaley, who ended her campaign after losses to Trump across almost all Super Tuesday states in early March, recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In her farewell speech a day after Trump\u00b4s big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had supported her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nTrump had been withering in his criticism of Haley, calling her \"Birdbrain\" in speeches to his supporters and questioning her decision to stay in the race.\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party\u00b4s eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach, via her Stand for America PAC, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in African during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\nAssociated Press writer Meg

She Left the Race in March", "body": "The backing for Haley -- most recently in Indiana, where she grabbed more than 21% of the votes on Tuesday -- signals persistent discontent among party voters with the former president. He is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who qualified for the Indiana ballot before she dropped out two months ago, has not endorsed Trump.\n\nA Haley campaign adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the results.\n\nIndiana Democrats did not have the option to vote \" uncommitted \" in their party primary. Unease about President Joe Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a protest vote movement in some states, raising similar questions about the strength of his support in November.\n\nHaley's support was largest in Indiana's urban and suburban counties. She won 35% of the vote in Indianapolis's Marion County and more than one-third of the vote in suburban Hamilton County. As in other states, she did best in the most Democratic areas of the state.\n\nThe exception was Lake County, home to Gary, just south of Chicago. Haley won only 14% of the vote in Lake County.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Pennsylvania, Haley received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIn late January, Trump said prematurely that Haley did not have enough signatures to make Indiana's primary ballot. While Haley did get the minimum 500 signatures needed in each congressional district to make the ballot, the margin was razor thin in the 7th District, which includes Indianapolis.\n\nHaley's campaign was largely absent from the state even while she was in the race.\n\nIndiana, with its 11 electoral votes, is far from the swing state that Pennsylvania is. Trump won Indiana by 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nNonetheless, Haley's support from 1 in 5 Republican voters raises questions about how they will vote in the fall. Before she dropped out, she took nearly 27% of votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nHaley, who ended her campaign after losses to Trump across almost all Super Tuesday states in early March, recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had supported her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nTrump had been withering in his criticism of Haley, calling her \"Birdbrain\" in speeches to his supporters and questioning her decision to stay in the race.\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach, via her Stand for America PAC, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in African during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The ex-president even expanded his support in the state from 2016.\n\nIn the last twenty-one presidential elections, Democrats have only won the state two times: Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nBut Tuesday's results are just the latest in a series of primaries where a number of voters to cast Republican ballots of opted not to fall in line since Trump cinched the necessary number of delegates.\n\n'Nikki dropped out two months ago and is still earning a sizable chunk of the primary vote,' said a former Haley staffer. 'You'd have to be a birdbrain to not understand that Trump needs Haley Republicans to win in November.'\n\nTrump is the presumptive Republican nominee and has turned his attention to the general election but Haley continues to receive GOP primary votes while Trump should be shoring up the party base\n\nJust two weeks ago, Haley received more than 155,000 voters in the Pennsylvania Republican primary, a significant number in a battleground state Biden won by less than 100,000 voters in 2020.\n\nHaley raked in more than half a million votes combined in the March 19 primaries including ones in Florida, Ohio and Arizona, weeks after she dropped out of the race.\n\nWhile the ex-president was able to clinch the nomination much earlier this year than has been seen in past non-incumbent primaries, Haley has not come forward to endorse her one time boss and political opponent.\n\nIn response to Indiana's results, a Trump campaign official pointed out that the state has an open primary, meaning any registered voter may participate in either of the party's primaries, and Democrats had few competitive contests.\n\nHaley received a significant number of her votes around in Indianapolis and surrounding suburbs.\n\nNikki Haley received more than half a million votes in the March 19 primaries despite dropping out of the race the day after Super Tuesday. On Tuesday she received 128,000 votes in Indiana's Republican presidential primary\n\nThe Trump campaign official argued Democrats in earlier contests were more than happy to vote for Haley and were in fact encouraged through funded campaigns to do so.\n\nThe Trump campaign having clinched the necessary delegates for Trump to be the nominee weeks ago has not spent money or resources on the primary campaign.\n\nThey said they would win Indiana and the White House come November.\n\nBut the Biden campaign has been chomping at the bit to woo Haley voters to support the president in November.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign has been actively courting Nikki Haley voters for the general election\n\nPresident Biden has openly invited Haley voters to join the fold. The campaign even released an ad making a direct appeal to Haley voters to support Biden and reject Trump in late March. It targeted those primarily in suburban battleground areas where Haley did will in the primaries against Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has been trapped in a New York courtroom the better part of the past three weeks with limited campaign stops in battleground states as he faces criminal charges for falsifying business records in the hush money case.\n\nWhen not in court, the ex-president has focused much of his campaign effort on battleground states.\n\nLast week, he made stops in Michigan and Wisconsin. This weekend he is headed to Wildwood, New Jersey for a campaign rally.\n\nAs for Haley, last month is was announced she was joining the conservative Hudson Institute, her first big move since dropping out of the primary on March 6.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Trump received more than 78.3 percent of the vote in the red state's primary on Tuesday, more than 461,000 voters.\n\nBut more than 128,000 voters, 21 percent, cast ballots for Nikki Haley, the one time Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race more than two months ago after Super Tuesday. Despite having a strong hold on the majority of the Republican party, the results Tuesday signal trouble for the former Republican president as he looks to shore up GOP support and expand his base for the general election in November.\n\nIndiana is a red state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2020 with 57 percent of the vote against Joe Biden. The ex-president even expanded his support in the state from 2016. In the last twenty-one presidential elections, Democrats have only won the state two times: Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nBut Tuesday's results are just the latest in a series of primaries where a number of voters to cast Republican ballots of opted not to fall in line since Trump cinched the necessary number of delegates. 'Nikki dropped out two months ago and is still earning a sizable chunk of the primary vote,' said a former Haley staffer. 'You'd have to be a birdbrain to not understand that Trump needs Haley Republicans to win in November.' Just two weeks ago, Haley received more than 155,000 voters in the Pennsylvania Republican primary, a significant number in a battleground state Biden won by less than 100,000 voters in 2020.\n\nHaley raked in more than half a million votes combined in the March 19 primaries including ones in Florida, Ohio and Arizona, weeks after she dropped out of the race. While the ex-president was able to clinch the nomination much earlier this year than has been seen in past non-incumbent primaries, Haley has not come forward to endorse her one time boss and political opponent.\n\nIn response to Indiana's results, a Trump campaign official pointed out that the state has an open primary, meaning any registered voter may participate in either of the party's primaries, and Democrats had few competitive contests. Haley received a significant number of her votes around in Indianapolis and surrounding suburbs.\n\nThe Trump campaign official argued Democrats in earlier contests were more than happy to vote for Haley and were in fact encouraged through funded campaigns to do so. The Trump campaign having clinched the necessary delegates for Trump to be the nominee weeks ago has not spent money or resources on the primary campaign. They said they would win Indiana and the White House come November.\n\nBut the Biden campaign has been chomping at the bit to woo Haley voters to support the president in November. President Biden has openly invited Haley voters to join the fold. The campaign even released an ad making a direct appeal to Haley voters to support Biden and reject Trump in late March. It targeted those primarily in suburban battleground areas where Haley did will in the primaries against Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has been trapped in a New York courtroom the better part of the past three weeks with limited campaign stops in battleground states as he faces criminal charges for falsifying business records in the hush money case. When not in court, the ex-president has focused much of his campaign effort on battleground states.\n\nLast week, he made stops in Michigan and Wisconsin. This weekend he is headed to Wildwood, New Jersey for a campaign rally. As for Haley, last month it was announced she was joining the conservative Hudson Institute, her first big move since dropping out of the primary on March 6.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

No Trump Endorsement Is Expected", "body": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Nikki Haley is meeting next week with donors who supported her now-abandoned Republican presidential campaign, a reentry into public life that comes as the former South Carolina governor keeps drawing notable support in some state primaries despite Donald Trump's status as the presumptive nominee.\n\nHaley will appear at events on Monday and Tuesday with about 100 donors in Charleston, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The gathering, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is intended as a \"thank you\" to Haley's supporters.\n\nHaley is not expected to endorse Trump at that time or ask her donors to back any other candidates, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHaley's ability to win a significant share of the vote in some primaries where her name still appears on ballots showcases the division among Republicans as Trump marches toward a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nDespite exiting the race after a near-rout by Trump across the Super Tuesday contests in early March, Haley grabbed more than 21% of the votes in Indiana's primary Tuesday. Two weeks ago, in Pennsylvania, she received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\nBefore she dropped out, Haley won nearly 27% of the votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIndiana has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in either party's primary.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley's support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November as in 2016 and 2020, when he easily won the heavily Republican state.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nHaley, whose name is frequently mentioned already as a contender for the 2028 nomination, as well as potentially as a vice presidential pick for Trump, isn't expected to talk about her own political future at the Charleston events, according to the person with knowledge of her plans.\n\nTrump is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nIn her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had backed her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, when the most delegates are up for grabs of any day in the primary calendar, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nAt least officially, Haley has moved on from this year's campaign. The former U.N. ambassador under Trump recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach via her Stand for America political action committee, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in Africa during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) - Nikki Haley is meeting next week with donors who supported her now-abandoned Republican presidential campaign, a reentry into public life that comes as the former South Carolina governor keeps drawing notable support in some state primaries despite Donald Trump's status as the presumptive nominee.\n\nHaley will appear at events on Monday and Tuesday with about 100 donors in Charleston, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The gathering, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is intended as a \"thank you\" to Haley's supporters.\n\nHaley is not expected to endorse Trump at that time or ask her donors to back any other candidates, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHaley's ability to win a significant share of the vote in some primaries where her name still appears on ballots showcases the division among Republicans as Trump marches toward a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nDespite exiting the race after a near-rout by Trump across the Super Tuesday contests in early March, Haley grabbed more than 21% of the votes in Indiana's primary Tuesday. Two weeks ago, in Pennsylvania, she received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\nBefore she dropped out, Haley won nearly 27% of the votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nFILE - Republican presidential candidate former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks at a campaign event in Forth Worth, Texas, March 4, 2024.

A person with knowledge of her plans says the former South Carolina governor is appearing Monday, May 13, and Tuesday, with about 100 donors in Charleston, S.C. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File)\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley\u00b4s support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIndiana has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in either party\u00b4s primary.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley\u00b4s support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November as in 2016 and 2020, when he easily won the heavily Republican state.\n\nBiden\u00b4s campaign attributed Haley\u00b4s Indiana showing to Trump\u00b4s trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nHaley, whose name is frequently mentioned already as a contender for the 2028 nomination, as well as potentially as a vice presidential pick for Trump, isn't expected to talk about her own political future at the Charleston events, according to the person with knowledge of her plans.\n\nTrump is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nIn her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had backed her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, when the most delegates are up for grabs of any day in the primary calendar, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party\u00b4s eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nAt least officially, Haley has moved on from this year's campaign. The former U.N. ambassador under Trump recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach via her Stand for America political action committee, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in Africa during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP", "source": {"uri":

The gathering, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is intended as a \"thank you\" to Haley's supporters.\n\nHaley is not expected to endorse Trump at that time or ask her donors to back any other candidates, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHaley's ability to win a significant share of the vote in some primaries where her name still appears on ballots showcases the division among Republicans as Trump marches toward a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nDespite exiting the race after a near-rout by Trump across the Super Tuesday contests in early March, Haley grabbed more than 21% of the votes in Indiana's primary Tuesday. Two weeks ago, in Pennsylvania, she received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\nBefore she dropped out, Haley won nearly 27% of the votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIndiana has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in either party's primary.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley's support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November as in 2016 and 2020, when he easily won the heavily Republican state.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nHaley, whose name is frequently mentioned already as a contender for the 2028 nomination, as well as potentially as a vice presidential pick for Trump, isn't expected to talk about her own political future at the Charleston events, according to the person with knowledge of her plans.\n\nTrump is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nIn her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had backed her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, when the most delegates are up for grabs of any day in the primary calendar, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nAt least officially, Haley has moved on from this year's campaign. The former U.N. ambassador under Trump recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach via her Stand for America political action committee, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in Africa during a large portion of her primary campaign.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She left the race in March", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The ghost of Nikki Haley's presidential campaign is ringing up significant support in state primaries despite her withdrawal from the race in March shortly before Donald Trump had clinched the Republican nomination.\n\nThe backing for Haley -- most recently in Indiana, where she grabbed more than 21% of the votes on Tuesday -- signals persistent discontent among party voters with the former president. He is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who qualified for the Indiana ballot before she dropped out two months ago, has not endorsed Trump.\n\nA Haley campaign adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the results.\n\nIndiana Democrats did not have the option to vote \" uncommitted \" in their party primary. Unease about President Joe Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a protest vote movement in some states, raising similar questions about the strength of his support in November.\n\nHaley's support was largest in Indiana's urban and suburban counties. She won 35% of the vote in Indianapolis's Marion County and more than one-third of the vote in suburban Hamilton County. As in other states, she did best in the most Democratic areas of the state.\n\nThe exception was Lake County, home to Gary, just south of Chicago. Haley won only 14% of the vote in Lake County.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

While Haley did get the minimum 500 signatures needed in each congressional district to make the ballot, the margin was razor thin in the 7th District, which includes Indianapolis.\n\nHaley's campaign was largely absent from the state even while she was in the race.\n\nIndiana, with its 11 electoral votes, is far from the swing state that Pennsylvania is. Trump won Indiana by 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nNonetheless, Haley's support from 1 in 5 Republican voters raises questions about how they will vote in the fall. Before she dropped out, she took nearly 27% of votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nHaley, who ended her campaign after losses to Trump across almost all Super Tuesday states in early March, recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had supported her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him.

stay in the race.\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the

The most recent insult occurred on May 7 during the GOP primary in Indiana, when Haley received over 128,000 votes -- a staggering 22% of the total vote, 'thumbing the nose' at Trump, per Washington Examiner.\n\nHaley even received more than 30% of the vote in several Hoosier State counties, including Marion, Hamilton, and Boone. Indiana put Donald Trump in the running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, per POLITICO. Eight years later, however, with Haley cleaning up in the suburbs, the state he once dubbed \"Importantville\" sent some blazing red caution flags to his campaign.\n\nDespite Indiana's reputation as a consistently conservative state, the primary served as the most recent indication that Trump, even after securing the GOP nomination in March, still has to unite the GOP around his third presidential bid. Haley's substantial performance comes after many other primaries in which she received notable percentages of the vote despite her dropping out of the presidential campaign more than two months ago.\n\nHaley received over 150,000 votes in the GOP primary in Pennsylvania, and her vote share was almost twice as high as the 80,000 votes that helped Biden defeat Trump in the Keystone State in 2020. During last month's GOP primary, Haley also received over 13% of the vote in Wisconsin, a considerably important battleground state.\n\nThe chilly relationship between Trump and Haley is especially noteworthy because a bitter Trump opponent, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), recently visited with the former president in Miami. Haley, however, withdrew from the campaign without even endorsing Trump. Rather, she stated that the former president would have to \"earn the votes\" of her followers, per The Hill. \"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that,\" Haley said at the time.\n\nTrump, who has publicly shunned Haley and her voters multiple times throughout his presidential campaign, is doubtful to receive these protest votes, who form a significant portion of the Never Trump camp. President Joe Biden and his team have courted these voters on several occasions. Earlier this year, the Biden campaign released an ad including images of Trump disparaging Haley during the GOP presidential race, with a message warning voters, \"If you voted for Nikki Haley, Donald Trump doesn't want your vote.\"\n\nOther Never Trump organizations such as The Lincoln Project and Republican Voters Against Trump (RVAT) have spent millions of dollars on spots campaigning for Haley voters to turn Democrat and vote for Biden instead. The super PAC, Primary Pivot, for instance, a strong backer of Haley, relaunched after Super Tuesday as Haley Voters for Biden.\n\n\"When people say the NeverTrumpers have to pick a side, they're missing a big part,\" Sarah Longwell of the RVAT told TIME in February. \"I will support anyone against Trump.

He is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who qualified for the Indiana ballot before she ended her campaign two months ago, has not endorsed Trump.\n\nPalmetto Politics What's next for Nikki Haley? Hard choices, the Trump question and maybe a new job By Caitlin Byrd cbyrd@postandcourier.com\n\nA Haley campaign adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the results.\n\nIndiana Democrats did not have the option to vote \" uncommitted \" in their party primary. Unease about President Joe Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a protest vote movement in some states, raising similar questions about the strength of his support in November.\n\nHaley's support was largest in Indiana's urban and suburban counties. She won 35 percent of the vote in Indianapolis's Marion County and more than one-third of the vote in suburban Hamilton County. As in other states, she did best in the most Democratic areas of the state.\n\nThe exception was Lake County, home to Gary, just south of Chicago. Haley won only 14 percent of the vote in Lake County.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley's support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November, as in 2016 and 2020.\n\nPalmetto Politics Nikki Haley drops out of presidential race without delivering a Trump endorsement By Caitlin Byrd\n\nand Schuyler Kropf cbyrd@postandcourier.com\n\nskropf@postandcourier.com\n\nTwo weeks ago in Pennsylvania, Haley received nearly 17 percent of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Mica Miller's final hours: NC sheriff releases findings of Myrtle Beach woman's death Timeline: What happened on the day Mica Miller died?

While Haley did get the minimum 500 signatures needed in each congressional district to make the ballot, the margin was razor-thin in the 7th District, which includes Indianapolis.\n\nHaley's campaign was largely absent from the state even while she was in the race.\n\nIndiana, with its 11 electoral votes, is far from the swing state that Pennsylvania is.

Before she dropped out, she took nearly 27 percent of votes in Michigan. She received 13 percent of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nHaley, who ended her campaign after losses to Trump across almost all Super Tuesday states in early March, recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had supported her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nTrump had been withering in his criticism of Haley, calling her \"Birdbrain\" in speeches to his supporters and questioning her decision to stay in the race.\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach, via her Stand for America PAC, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in African during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\nPalmetto Politics Nikki Haley has a new gig after running for president.

No Trump endorsement is expected", "body": "Haley will appear at events on Monday and Tuesday with about 100 donors in Charleston, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The gathering, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is intended as a \"thank you\" to Haley's supporters.\n\nHaley is not expected to endorse Trump at that time or ask her donors to back any other candidates, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHaley's ability to win a significant share of the vote in some primaries where her name still appears on ballots showcases the division among Republicans as Trump marches toward a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nDespite exiting the race after a near-rout by Trump across the Super Tuesday contests in early March, Haley grabbed more than 21% of the votes in Indiana's primary Tuesday. Two weeks ago, in Pennsylvania, she received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\nBefore she dropped out, Haley won nearly 27% of the votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIndiana has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in either party's primary.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley's support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November as in 2016 and 2020, when he easily won the heavily Republican state.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nHaley, whose name is frequently mentioned already as a contender for the 2028 nomination, as well as potentially as a vice presidential pick for Trump, isn't expected to talk about her own political future at the Charleston events, according to the person with knowledge of her plans.\n\nTrump is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nIn her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had backed her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, when the most delegates are up for grabs of any day in the primary calendar, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nAt least officially, Haley has moved on from this year's campaign. The former U.N. ambassador under Trump recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach via her Stand for America political action committee, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in Africa during a large portion of her primary campaign.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(All vote totals and percentages are from the Associated Press via Google and are current as of time of publication.)\n\nIn Alabama, Haley took 13%. In Oklahoma, 15.9%. In Texas, 17.4%. Tennessee, 19.5%.\n\nREAD MORE: 'This Isn't Justice': Legal Experts Blast Cannon for Postponing Trump Case Indefinitely\n\nBut after Haley dropped out, effectively handing Trump the nomination, Republican primary voters continued to vote for her, and continued to vote for her almost always in double-digit percentages.\n\nIn Arizona, Haley won 17.8% of the primary vote. In Georgia, 13.2%. In Kansas, 16.1%.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Haley won a whopping 43.2% 0f the GOP primary vote.\n\nTuesday night as the Indiana results were still coming in but pretty much solidified, David Nir, publisher of Daily Kos Elections, asked, \"Is Nikki Haley getting *more* popular? Right now, she's at 21.6% in Indiana with more than 70% reporting. If it holds, that would be her best showing since dropping out after Super Tuesday.\"\n\nSarah Longwell, publisher of The Bulwark, replied, \"No. It doesn't have much at all to do with Nikki Haley. It's that the broadest coalition in American politics is the anti-Trump coalition.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Johnson Demands All Trump Prosecutions Cease, Vows to Use Congress 'In Every Possible Way'\n\nAmanda Carpenter, a Republican political commentator who once worked for far-right GOP lawmakers including Senators Ted Cruz and Jim DeMint, agrees with the anti-Trump theory.\n\n\"It's almost as if...more and more Republicans, each day, are rejecting Trump. Perhaps these [Indiana] voters heard what their former congressman and Governor and later Vice President Mike Pence had to say about the president he served?\" she wrote. \"In all seriousness though, this is not a Nikki Haley movement showing up in double digits in multiple states. It's anti-Trump GOP voters. Can you hear them yet? This is real.\"\n\nThe New York Times last month took a look at what is called the \"zombie vote,\" votes for candidates who have already dropped out.\n\nAccording to the Times, the \"zombie vote in this year's Republican primary has actually been low by historical standards. In Democratic and Republican primaries going back to 2000, roughly a quarter of voters picked a candidate other than the eventual nominee even after all the other serious contenders had exited the race.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Trump Threatens to Violate Gag Order and Go to Jail: 'I'll Do That Sacrifice Any Day'\n\n\"For Mr. Trump,\" the Times adds, \"what matters is how many of Ms. Haley's primary voters will rally behind him come November. Polls have shown that her supporters are likely to say they will vote for Mr. Biden. Even so, those same polls often find that many of those voters already supported Mr. Biden in 2020.\"\n\nThe Nation's John Nichols last month pointed to just that, after the Pennsylvania primary:\n\n\"Haley is not campaigning, but she just won almost 158,000 GOP primary votes in the critical state of Pennsylvania. Democrats think they can swing many of them to Biden.\"\n\nLate Tuesday night, pointing to Haley taking more than a third of the vote in some Indiana counties, Nichols concluded, \"These numbers

She left the race in March", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The ghost of Nikki Haley's presidential campaign is ringing up significant support in state primaries despite her withdrawal from the race in March shortly before Donald Trump had clinched the Republican nomination.\n\nThe backing for Haley -- most recently in Indiana, where she grabbed more than 21% of the votes on Tuesday -- signals persistent discontent among party voters with the former president. He is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who qualified for the Indiana ballot before she dropped out two months ago, has not endorsed Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA Haley campaign adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the results.\n\nIndiana Democrats did not have the option to vote \" uncommitted \" in their party primary. Unease about President Joe Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a protest vote movement in some states, raising similar questions about the strength of his support in November.\n\nHaley's support was largest in Indiana's urban and suburban counties. She won 35% of the vote in Indianapolis's Marion County and more than one-third of the vote in suburban Hamilton County. As in other states, she did best in the most Democratic areas of the state.\n\nThe exception was Lake County, home to Gary, just south of Chicago. Haley won only 14% of the vote in Lake County.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Pennsylvania, Haley received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIn late January, Trump said prematurely that Haley did not have enough signatures to make Indiana's primary ballot. While Haley did get the minimum 500 signatures needed in each congressional district to make the ballot, the margin was razor thin in the 7th District, which includes Indianapolis.\n\nHaley's campaign was largely absent from the state even while she was in the race.\n\nIndiana, with its 11 electoral votes, is far from the swing state that Pennsylvania is. Trump won Indiana by 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNonetheless, Haley's support from 1 in 5 Republican voters raises questions about how they will vote in the fall. Before she dropped out, she took nearly 27% of votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nHaley, who ended her campaign after losses to Trump across almost all Super Tuesday states in early March, recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had supported her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nTrump had been withering in his criticism of Haley, calling her \"Birdbrain\" in speeches to his supporters and questioning her decision to stay in the race.\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach, via her Stand for America PAC, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in African during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com",

It's the latest sign that a sizable portion of the GOP's base still does not want to support the MAGA former president.\n\nWhen broken down further, the Indiana Republican primary results showed that the former United Nations ambassador achieved more than 30 percent in several areas, such as Marion Country, where the state capital, Indianapolis, is located, and the affluent suburb of Hamilton Country.\n\nWhile discussing the results Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for President Joe Biden's 2024 campaign team, posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"Nikki Haley dropped out 2 months ago. Tonight she's picking up over 100,000 votes and 22% of the primary vote in *Indiana.* Trump has a GOP base problem.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's office via email for comment.\n\nThe results in Indiana were not an outlier for Haley. The former South Carolina governor, who was seen as a more moderate Republican candidate, managed to achieve between 20 and 40 percent of the votes in several states on Super Tuesday -- including Massachusetts (37 percent), Colorado (34 percent) and Minnesota (29 percent) -- on her way to winning more than two million votes.\n\nEven after she dropped out of the race, Haley still received 16.6 percent of the vote in the key swing state of Pennsylvania on April 23, more than 158,000 ballots.\n\nThe general election results in Pennsylvania in November could help determine who will enter the White House next year.\n\nIn 2020, Trump lost the swing state to Biden by just over 1 percent, or 80,555 votes. Haley achieved nearly double the votes in the GOP primary than the amount Trump lost in 2020, with no guarantee Haley's supporters will go on to support Trump in the 2024 general election\n\nChristopher Borick, a professor of political science and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Newsweek: \"Nikki Haley's significant share of the vote in the GOP primary in Pennsylvania is an absolute warning sign for Trump.\"\n\n\"Her 16 percent share of the vote is quite a signal for the Trump campaign that they have work to do in shoring up the Republican base in a crucial battleground,\" he said.\n\nBorick added that Haley performed best in the suburbs among highly educated and wealthier Republicans who maintain \"significant reservations\" about Trump.\n\n\"In 2020, those Philadelphia suburbs played a pivotal role in propelling Biden to a fairly narrow victory, and the results in the primary indicate a challenging landscape for Trump to navigate this year,\" he said.\n\n\"To be sure, the primary results show Biden with his own struggles maintaining his 2020 coalition, but Trump's weak spots seem to have been highlighted to a greater degree.\"\n\nIn an interview with Lancaster news station WGAL, Trump downplayed the significance of Haley still getting 16 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania as it is a \"very small number\" that he will sweep up come November.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me because, first of all, what's their choice? Biden? He's the worst president in the history of our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\"There's never been a president so bad. He's incompetent. So they're all coming to me. We see it already, they're all coming to me.\"\n\nThe GOP primaries continue with elections in Maryland, Nebraska, and West Virginia on May 14.

Late last month, Haley also nabbed over 150,000 votes in the Pennsylvania GOP primary.\n\nIn her speech announcing the suspension of her campaign, the former South Carolina governor refused to endorse Trump, as other previous candidates had. Instead, she said it would be up to the former president to \"earn the votes\" of her supporters.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him, and I hope he does that,\" Haley said at the time. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away.

No Trump endorsement is expected", "body": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Nikki Haley is meeting next week with donors who supported her now-abandoned Republican presidential campaign, a reentry into public life that comes as the former South Carolina governor keeps drawing notable support in some state primaries despite Donald Trump's status as the presumptive nominee.\n\nHaley will appear at events on Monday and Tuesday with about 100 donors in Charleston, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The gathering, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is intended as a \"thank you\" to Haley's supporters.\n\nHaley is not expected to endorse Trump at that time or ask her donors to back any other candidates, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHaley's ability to win a significant share of the vote in some primaries where her name still appears on ballots showcases the division among Republicans as Trump marches toward a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nDespite exiting the race after a near-rout by Trump across the Super Tuesday contests in early March, Haley grabbed more than 21% of the votes in Indiana's primary Tuesday. Two weeks ago, in Pennsylvania, she received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\nBefore she dropped out, Haley won nearly 27% of the votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIndiana has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in either party's primary.\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley's support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November as in 2016 and 2020, when he easily won the heavily Republican state.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Whataburger pulls request for 24/7 Greenville drive thru, pushes ahead with another Timeline: What happened on the day Mica Miller died?

The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nHaley, whose name is frequently mentioned already as a contender for the 2028 nomination, as well as potentially as a vice presidential pick for Trump, isn't expected to talk about her own political future at the Charleston events, according to the person with knowledge of her plans.\n\nTrump is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nIn her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had backed her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, when the most delegates are up for grabs of any day in the primary calendar, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nAt least officially, Haley has moved on from this year's campaign. The former U.N. ambassador under Trump recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach via her Stand for America political action committee, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in Africa during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "meg_kinnard@postandcourier.com", "name": "Meg Kinnard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_Welcome_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UFO Welcome Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Gemstones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Righteous Gemstones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGAL", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WGAL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Indiana is one of the most Republican friendly states in the nation. There is no way that under normal circumstances a candidate like Haley who dropped out of the race, after Trump clinched the nomination should be getting anything close to 20% of the vote.\n\nThere is a segment of the Republican Party that keeps sending the message over and over again in these primaries that they do not want Donald Trump to be their party's nominee. The polling says that the hush money trial and all of his legal problems don't hurt Trump with Republicans, but the primary results tell a different story.\n\nSomething is harming Trump and causing nearly a quarter of his party to turn against him.There are warning signs flashing all around the Trump campaign that aren't there for Democrats and Joe Biden.

No Trump endorsement is expected", "body": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Nikki Haley is meeting next week with donors who supported her now-abandoned Republican presidential campaign, a reentry into public life that comes as the former South Carolina governor keeps drawing notable support in some state primaries despite Donald Trump's status as the presumptive nominee.\n\nHaley will appear at events on Monday and Tuesday with about 100 donors in Charleston, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The gathering, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is intended as a \"thank you\" to Haley's supporters.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHaley is not expected to endorse Trump at that time or ask her donors to back any other candidates, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHaley's ability to win a significant share of the vote in some primaries where her name still appears on ballots showcases the division among Republicans as Trump marches toward a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nDespite exiting the race after a near-rout by Trump across the Super Tuesday contests in early March, Haley grabbed more than 21% of the votes in Indiana's primary Tuesday. Two weeks ago, in Pennsylvania, she received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after leaving the race.\n\nBefore she dropped out, Haley won nearly 27% of the votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIndiana has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in either party's primary.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Trump campaign claimed without evidence that Haley's support came from Democrats, adding that he would carry Indiana in November as in 2016 and 2020, when he easily won the heavily Republican state.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nHaley, whose name is frequently mentioned already as a contender for the 2028 nomination, as well as potentially as a vice presidential pick for Trump, isn't expected to talk about her own political future at the Charleston events, according to the person with knowledge of her plans.\n\nTrump is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nIn her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had backed her.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, when the most delegates are up for grabs of any day in the primary calendar, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nAt least officially, Haley has moved on from this year's campaign. The former U.N. ambassador under Trump recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach via her Stand for America political action committee, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in Africa during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\nRead more on the U.S.

Yet as has been the pattern throughout the year, Haley showed strength among Indiana suburban and urban voters - demographics throughout the country that historically have been trouble spots for the former president.\n\nThe results in Indiana won't have direct bearing on Trump's Nov. 5 general election matchup with Democratic President Joe Biden. The state leans heavily conservative and will almost certainly back Trump, who won the primary on Tuesday with 78% of the vote.\n\nHowever, the primary results offered the latest signal that some Republicans and independent voters remain wary of Trump.\n\n\"Republicans are using the opportunity to vote for Haley as an easy expression of unhappiness with Trump,\" said Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst with Inside Elections in Washington. \"There's a contingent of Republicans who don't like him and would have rather had another nominee. Voting for Haley communicates that.\"\n\nIndiana allows independents and Democrats to vote in the Republican primary. Those who did likely broke for Haley, as they did in other states such as New Hampshire and Virginia during the primary earlier this year.\n\nTrump has been restricted from robust campaigning since the start last month of his hush money trial, where he is accused of illegally covering up a $130,000 payment to a porn star to keep her quiet in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nOn the day Indiana voters went to the polls, TV screens across the country were filled with images of Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who testified about a tryst she said she had with Trump almost 20 years ago. Trump, the first former U.S. president to face a criminal trial, has pleaded not guilty and denies that he ever had sex with Daniels.\n\nIn Pennsylvania's primary on April 23, Haley scored 20% or more of the vote against Trump mostly in suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia, a region filled with independent and moderate voters. In Arizona's primary in March, she ended up with close to 20% of the vote in that state's largest county, Maricopa.\n\nLikewise, in Tuesday's primary, Haley took more than 30% of the vote in Indianapolis, the city's largest state, and surrounding areas including a county that is home to a major university, Purdue. She drew nearly 22% of the overall primary vote.\n\nSarah Longwell, a Republican pollster who has been critical of Trump, said the result had little to do with Haley, who has largely stayed out of the public eye since dropping out. Instead, Longwell said, it shows that more voters in the country oppose Trump than support him.\n\n\"The broadest coalition in American politics is the anti-Trump coalition,\" Longwell wrote on X.\n\nHow many of those college-educated and other reluctant voters Trump needs to win in November is still a question. Most opinion polls, including Reuters/Ipsos surveys, have the race with Biden essentially even with six months to go.\n\nState polls aggregated by the political site Five Thirty-Eight show Trump with a slight lead in six states that will determine the election: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nRubashkin said while Trump can't afford much slippage in terms of support, the voters who came out for Haley in Indiana won't necessarily pull the lever for a Democrat in November.\n\n\"It's a very different thing to vote for Haley in a primary that doesn't matter than to vote for Biden in a close general election,\" Rubashkin said.\n\n(Reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Alistair Bell)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType":

He is racking up primary victories even as he has been spending much of his time recently in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges involving hush money payments to a porn actor.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Rivian receives $827M state incentive package to expand operations in Normal\n\nHaley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador who qualified for the Indiana ballot before she dropped out two months ago, has not endorsed Trump.\n\nA Haley campaign adviser did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the results.\n\nIndiana Democrats did not have the option to vote \" uncommitted \" in their party primary. Unease about President Joe Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a protest vote movement in some states, raising similar questions about the strength of his support in November.\n\nHaley's support was largest in Indiana's urban and suburban counties. She won 35% of the vote in Indianapolis's Marion County and more than one-third of the vote in suburban Hamilton County. As in other states, she did best in the most Democratic areas of the state.\n\nThe exception was Lake County, home to Gary, just south of Chicago. Haley won only 14% of the vote in Lake County.\n\nBiden's campaign attributed Haley's Indiana showing to Trump's trouble in suburbs and cited similar primary numbers in swing states such as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The president has made an open appeal to Haley supporters to back him in November.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Pennsylvania, Haley received nearly 17% of the primary vote. She earned similar support in Arizona just weeks after her exit.\n\nTrump, who won every Indiana county, brushed off Haley's support in an interview Tuesday with WGAL-TV of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"All of those people are going to come to me,\" he said.\n\nIn late January, Trump said prematurely that Haley did not have enough signatures to make Indiana's primary ballot. While Haley did get the minimum 500 signatures needed in each congressional district to make the ballot, the margin was razor thin in the 7th District, which includes Indianapolis.\n\nHaley's campaign was largely absent from the state even while she was in the race.\n\nIndiana, with its 11 electoral votes, is far from the swing state that Pennsylvania is. Trump won Indiana by 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nNonetheless, Haley's support from 1 in 5 Republican voters raises questions about how they will vote in the fall. Before she dropped out, she took nearly 27% of votes in Michigan. She received 13% of the Georgia GOP vote shortly after her exit.\n\nHaley, who ended her campaign after losses to Trump across almost all Super Tuesday states in early March, recently announced she was joining the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In her farewell speech a day after Trump's big night, Haley declined to directly endorse him. She put the onus on Trump to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who had supported her.\n\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" she said. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nTrump had been withering in his criticism of Haley, calling her \"Birdbrain\" in speeches to his supporters and questioning her decision to stay in the race.\n\nJust before Super Tuesday, Haley said she no longer felt bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party's eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nShe has said little publicly but has continued to utilize her email outreach, via her Stand for America PAC, sending out updates on her Hudson appointment, as well as the return of her husband, Michael, from a South Carolina Army National Guard deployment that saw him stationed in African during a large portion of her primary campaign.\n\nAssociated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

That constituted 21 percent of the Republican vote in the Hoosier State, meaning one in five registered conservatives still preferred Haley over their party's presumptive nominee.\n\nIt's the continuation of an anti-Trump GOP movement that has persisted even as Trump mows down an empty political field. Last month, Haley also managed to pull a significant portion of votes in Pennsylvania's GOP primary -- more than 158,000 votes, or 16.6 percent.\n\nOn her exit from the race, Haley skirted actually endorsing Trump as Trump's other GOP contenders did.

It's the latest sign that a significant portion of the GOP base still doesn't want to support the former MAGA president.\n\nWhen analyzed further, Indiana Republican primary results showed that the former United Nations ambassador received more than 30 percent in several areas, such as Marion Country, where the state capital is located, Indianapolis, and the affluent suburb of Hamilton Country.\n\nWhile discussing the results, Ammar Moussa, spokesperson for President Joe Biden's 2024 campaign team, posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"Nikki Haley dropped out of college 2 months ago. Tonight she garners over 100,000 votes and 22% of the primary vote in *Indiana.* Trump has a GOP base problem.\"\n\nIllustration of the news week.

Photo illustration by Newsweek/Getty Images\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's office via email for comment.\n\nThe results obtained in Indiana are no exception for Haley. The former South Carolina governor, considered a more moderate Republican candidate, managed to get between 20 and 40 percent of the vote in several states on Super Tuesday, including Massachusetts (37 percent), Colorado (34 percent). percent) and Minnesota (29 percent). percent) - on track to win more than two million votes.\n\nEven after dropping out of the race, Haley still received 16.6 percent of the vote in the key swing state of Pennsylvania on April 23, or more than 158,000 ballots cast.\n\nThe results of Pennsylvania's general election in November could help determine who enters the White House next year.\n\nIn 2020, Trump lost the swing state to Biden by just over 1%, or 80,555 votes. Haley received nearly double the number of votes in the Republican primaries compared to the amount Trump lost in 2020, with no guarantee that Haley's supporters will continue to support Trump in the 2024 general election.\n\nChristopher Borick, professor of political science and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, told Newsweek: \"Nikki Haley's significant vote share in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania is an absolute warning sign for Trump. \"\n\n\"His 16 percent vote share is a signal to the Trump campaign that they have work to do to consolidate the Republican base in a crucial battleground,\" he said.\n\nBorick added that Haley performs better in the suburbs among highly educated and wealthier Republicans who maintain \"significant reservations\" about Trump.\n\n\"In 2020, these Philadelphia suburbs played a central role in propelling Biden to a fairly close victory, and the primary results indicate a tough landscape for Trump this year,\" he said.\n\n\"Certainly, early results show Biden struggling to maintain his 2020 coalition, but Trump's weaknesses appear to have been more highlighted.\"\n\nIn an interview with Lancaster news station WGAL, Trump downplayed the fact that Haley still got 16 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania because it was a \"very small number\" that he will win in November.\n\n\"All these people are going to come to me because, first of all, what is their choice? Biden? He's the worst president in the history of our country,\" Trump said.\n\n\"There has never been such a bad president. He is incompetent. So they are all coming to me. We can already see it, they are all coming to me.\"\n\nThe GOP primaries continue with elections in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia on May 14. Trump will likely be confirmed as the 2024 GOP nominee at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nUncommon knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding

But it's not clear whether any of the people currently on his veep shortlist -- mostly MAGA senators and governors -- can capture the voters who want to move on from Trump.\n\nRepublicans floated as possible running mates include Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina and J.D. Vance of Ohio, as well as Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem -- even after Noem was pilloried for describing in a new book how she killed her aggressive hunting dog. None of them is seen as a likely vessel for winning over Haley's staunchest fans.\n\nGOP senators suggested that going after disaffected Haley voters should be a priority for Trump, who is narrowly leading in swing-state polls but fighting legal battles that make his political future uncertain.\n\n\"I think the population we need to be going after is this 17% of people that are not voting for President Trump in a primary even though Nikki is not even in the primary,\" Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said Wednesday, referring to Haley's share of the vote in Pennsylvania's GOP primary last month. \"I think he needs to bring a person that's going to complement him and bring those people to the table.\"\n\nMarshall floated former Kansas congressman and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as someone who could fit those qualifications.\n\n\"I think there's a group of Republicans out there that will play the long game,\" he added. \"They want to know who's going to be the president after President Trump. So whoever he chooses is going to be the betting-odds favorite to be the next president.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) urged the Trump campaign to pay attention to this week's Indiana primary results and \"see what demographic chose Nikki Haley over the president.\"\n\n\"I'd be instructed by that in my solution,\" he added.\n\nIn Indiana on Tuesday, Haley won roughly 1 in 5 GOP primary voters, underscoring the discontent among committed Republican voters with the former president, who faces 88 felony charges. About one-fifth of Republican primary voters in the swing states of Arizona, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania also cast a ballot for someone other than Trump.\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), an anti-Trump Republican, said that the primary results in his home state show how there is \"still a very sizable portion of the Republican Party that's insisting on a candidate who they can be proud of, on account of their character attributes and who promote a policy agenda consistent with basic [President Ronald] Reagan-era principles.\"\n\nHaley, for her part, has shown no sign of getting back on the Trump train anytime soon. Before she dropped out of the race in March, she excoriated her former boss over his conduct in office and his mental state, calling him \"diminished\" and \"unhinged.\" And she has declined to endorse his campaign, leaving Trump to suffer repeated embarrassments in primary contests across the country.\n\nThe people voting for Haley tend to be more affluent, better educated than Trump voters, and active enough in politics to bother casting a ballot in a long-over presidential primary. One recent exit poll found that many are likely to back President Joe Biden over Trump in November. These voters are largely clustered in swing counties surrounding major metro areas -- like the Philadelphia and Detroit suburbs -- where parties battle for the independent voters who decide presidential elections.\n\nAdrian Hemond, a Michigan Democrat who founded a bipartisan political consulting group, said that Trump needs to find a way to reassure skittish Haley voters if he wants to win in the Upper Midwest.\n\n\"These people are still clearly Republicans. They're voting in Republican nominating contests. ... They've just got beef with the former president,\" Hemond said. \"He needs to give them some sort of permission structure to vote for him so they feel like there will be an adult in the room, and there will be someone who can replace him if he's not capable of continuing in office for whatever reason.\"\n\nHemond said Trump would be well advised to pick a running mate who has a record independent of MAGA, like Burgum, who didn't compete against Trump in the primary long enough for things between them to get nasty.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of pressure on the former president not to pick a Republican senator, and at minimum not pick a Republican senator from a state that's at all competitive or a state where the governor cannot appoint a replacement,\" he said.\n\nBut Vance, a top Trump ally who hasn't been shy about expressing his interest in the VP job, rejected the notion that the ex-president needed to worry about the Haley protest vote.\n\n\"Attracting Nikki Haley voters should not be the focus of the vice presidential pick, but certainly you want somebody who's going to broadly appeal as much as possible to the country,\" Vance said. \"You don't want to alienate anybody, but I don't think [the] Nikki Haley bloc is big enough to be the focus.\"\n\nSome pollsters and analysts have backed Vance's analysis, noting that Haley's primary voters make up a relatively small portion of what will be a much larger general electorate and pointing to Trump's advantage with less-engaged voters as a more important factor for November.\n\nIn modern history, presidential campaigns have tended to pick running mates in hopes of broadening a candidate's appeal -- either to a geographic area or a particular group of voters. In the 2016 election, for example, Trump picked then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as a way to curry favor with social conservatives and evangelicals, influential GOP constituencies that initially hesitated to support a thrice-married New York real estate mogul. In 2008, Barack Obama selected Biden, then a veteran senator, in part because of his deep foreign policy experience.\n\nThis time, Trump is being urged to consider candidates who can appeal to wayward Republicans and independent voters turned off by his behavior and obsession with conspiracy theories, including those involving the veracity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Typically, the candidate looks for somebody who will broaden the base of support and appeal, not somebody who is exactly like them or attracts the same constituency,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who is running to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as the top Senate Republican, told HuffPost on Wednesday.\n\nHe added, \"I'd like President Trump to win, and I think the best formula for him to win would be to broaden that base by picking somebody who would bring that to the table.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Marshall_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Marshall (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

And I hope he does that,\" she said at the time. \"At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.\"\n\nWhen presidential hopefuls drop out of the US primaries, it's become quite common for them to endorse whoever takes the top spot to show a unified party front.\n\nMs Haley, however, stopped short of doing that. With her hopes of US leadership dashed, she has since moved on to work for an ultra-conservative think tank called the Hudson Institute.\n\nTwo months after dropping out, has she finally got behind Mr Trump?\n\nIt's less than six months before the US heads to the polls in one of the most tense elections of 2024.\n\nHowever, Ms Haley has refrained from publicly backing Mr Trump for the top spot so far. This tension appears to have stemmed from the bitter war of words the pair exchanged as they were vying for primary votes.\n\nDespite Ms Haley stepping aside, it looks like the politician still won't budge and this may actually hurt Mr Trump during the US election.\n\nEarlier this year, she suggested that Mr Trump was failing to unify the party and attract people back to his policies.\n\n\"Unity is not achieved by simply claiming 'we're united,\" she said as she dropped out. \"Today, in state after state, there remains a large block of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump.\n\n\"That is not the unity our party needs for success.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, there were signs that Mr Trump has done little to win over Republicans who were drawn to Ms Haley's policies.\n\nDespite dropping out, Ms Haley won over 20% of the primary vote in Indiana, suggesting that her supporters are similarly not open to endorsing Trump.\n\nAccording to CNN, a friend of Ms Haley said: \"He knows how to reach her if he wants to make amends and try to start winning over her supporters.\"\n\nMs Haley is the former Governor of South Carolina and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during Mr Trump's presidency.\n\nBorn Nimrata Randhawa to parents from Punjab in India, Ms Haley previously described herself as a \"brown girl in a black and white world\".\n\nHaving been involved in politics for some years, Ms Haley entered the presidential race in 2023 to challenge a predominantly male cohort for the role.\n\nThe 52-year-old conservative politician ran her campaign on the idea of bringing a new generation into leadership.\n\n\"I don't think you need to be 80 years old to go be a leader in DC. I think we need a new generation to come in, step up and really start fixing things,\" she said in 2023, in a swipe at both Joe Biden and Trump.\n\nBut where does she stand on the big issues?\n\nAccording to Newsnation, she is \"pro-life\" but has said in the past that she wasn't going to \"judge anyone for being pro-choice\".\n\nShe is also a staunch supporter of Israel, has a tough stance on immigration, argued that Medicare was unsustainable and supported the expansion of oil and gas drilling.\n\nAlthough she's out of the presidential race, it seems like her influence certainly swayed some public opinion.\n\nWith Mr Trump currently in court in the ongoing hush money trial, it remains to be seen whether Ms Haley's lack of support will have an impact on his chances later this year.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/9f6344c283371f4a96664a6c4a1fdc51", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549281", "eventUri": "eng-9549281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second despite investing significant time and financial resources in a state famous for its independent streak. She's the last major challenger after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential bid over the weekend, allowing her to campaign as the sole alternative to Trump.\n\nTrump's allies ramped up pressure on Haley to leave the race before the polls had closed, but Haley vowed after the results were announced to continue her campaign. Speaking to supporters, she intensified her criticism of the former president, questioning his mental acuity and pitching herself as a unifying candidate who would usher in generational change.\n\n\"This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go,\" Haley said, while some in the crowd cried, \"It's not over!\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, can now boast of being the first Republican presidential candidate to win open races in Iowa and New Hampshire since both states began leading the election calendar in 1976, a striking sign of how rapidly Republicans have rallied around him to make him their nominee for the third consecutive time.\n\nAt his victory party Tuesday night, Trump repeatedly insulted Haley and gave a far angrier speech than after his Iowa victory, when his message was one of Republican unity.\n\n\"Let's not have someone take a victory when she had a very bad night,\" Trump said. He added, \"Just a little note to Nikki: She's not going to win.\"\n\nWith easy wins in both early states, Trump is demonstrating an ability to unite the GOP's factions firmly behind him. He's garnered support from the evangelical conservatives who are influential in Iowa and New Hampshire's more moderate voters, strength he hopes to replicate during the general election.\n\nTrump posted especially strong results in the state's most conservative areas, while Haley won more liberal parts. The only areas in which Haley was leading Trump were in Democratic-leaning cities and towns such as Concord, Keene and Portsmouth.\n\nPat Sheridan, a 63-year-old engineer from Hampton, voted for Trump \"because he did a really good job the first time.\"\n\n\"We need a businessman, not bureaucrats,\" Sheridan said.\n\nAbout half of GOP primary voters said they are very or somewhat concerned that Trump is too extreme to win the general election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the state's electorate. Only about one-third say the same about Haley.\n\nStill, Haley's path to becoming the GOP standard-bearer is narrowing quickly. She won't compete in a contest that awards delegates until South Carolina's Feb. 24 primary, bypassing the Feb. 8 Nevada caucuses that are widely seen as favoring Trump.\n\nAs South Carolina's former governor, Haley is hoping a strong showing there could propel her into the March 5 Super Tuesday contests. But in a deeply conservative state where Trump is exceedingly popular, those ambitions may be tough to realize and a home-state loss could prove politically devastating.\n\n\"This is just the beginning; we've got the rest of the nation,\" said Sandy Adams, 66, an independent from Bow who supported Haley. \"I think we've got a strong candidate, and the first time we have just two candidates, and that's a great thing.\"\n\nOn the Democratic side, Biden won his party's primary but had to do so via a write-in effort. The Democratic National Committee voted to start its primary next month in South Carolina, but New Hampshire pushed ahead with its own contest. Biden didn't campaign or appear on the ballot but topped a series of little-known challengers.\n\nTrump's early sweep through the Republican primary is remarkable considering he faces 91 criminal charges related to everything from seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election to mishandling classified documents and arranging payoffs to a porn actress. He left the White House in 2021 in the grim aftermath of an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol led by his supporters who sought to stop the certification of Biden's win. And Trump was the first president to be impeached twice.\n\nBeyond the political vulnerabilities associated with the criminal cases, Trump faces a logistical challenge in balancing trials and campaigning. He has frequently appeared voluntarily at a New York courtroom where a jury is considering whether he should pay additional damages to a columnist who last year won a $5 million jury award against Trump for sex abuse and defamation. He has turned these appearances into campaign events, holding televised news conferences that give him an opportunity to spread his message to a large audience.\n\nBut Trump has turned those vulnerabilities into an advantage among GOP voters. He has argued that the criminal prosecutions reflect a politicized Justice Department, though there's no evidence that officials there were pressured by Biden or anyone else in the White House to file charges.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly told his supporters that he's being prosecuted on their behalf, an argument that appears to have further strengthened his bond with the GOP base.\n\nAs Trump begins to pivot his attention to Biden and a general election campaign, the question is whether the former president's framing of the legal cases will persuade voters beyond the GOP base. Trump lost the popular vote in the 2016 and 2020 elections and has faced particular struggles in suburban communities from Georgia to Pennsylvania to Arizona that could prove decisive in the fall campaign.\n\nTrump traveled frequently to New Hampshire in the months leading up to the primary but didn't spend as much time in the state as many of his rivals. Rather than the traditional approach of greeting voters personally or in small groups, Trump has staged large rallies. He has spent much of his time complaining about the past -- including the lie that the 2020 election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud.\n\nIf he returns to the White House, the former president has promised to enact a hardline immigration agenda that includes stopping migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and reimposing his first-term travel ban that originally targeted seven Muslim-majority countries. He's also said the rising number of immigrants entering the United States are \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" echoing Adolf Hitler's language.\n\nBiden faces his own challenges. There are widespread concerns about his age at 81 years old. Dissent is also building within his party over Biden's alliance with Israel in its war against Hamas, putting the president's standing at risk in swing states like Michigan. A rally he held in northern Virginia on Tuesday to promote abortion rights -- an issue his party sees as critical to success in November -- was disrupted repeatedly by protests over U.S. military support for Israel. One person shouted \"shame on you!\"\n\nBut he avoided potential embarrassment in New Hampshire even as rivals like Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips compared him in advertising to Bigfoot -- since both were hard to find.\n\nDurwood Sargent, 79, of Bow, cast a write-in vote for Biden and said he wasn't offended that the president kept his name off the ballot.\n\n\"It's not a big deal. They've made a big deal out of it. The president's got a country to run,\" he said.\n\n-- -- --\n\nColvin reported from Nashua, New Hampshire. Weissert reported from Washington.

Most conservatives want to give Trump another chance at beating President Joe Biden despite Trump's 2020 election loss and the 91 felony charges he faces in four separate indictments.\n\nWith voting about to begin in New Hampshire, almost every top Republican has lined up behind Trump. Polls in New Hampshire suggest he leads Haley in a state uniquely suited to her strengths, though his lead is narrower than the 30-point blowout he scored in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nHaley told reporters on Monday that she is expecting a stronger outcome than Iowa.\n\n\"This is a building game for us. This has always been that,\" she said. \"We feel very good about it.\"\n\nTrump held what he said would be his last rally before the election Monday night. He started the day in New York for his defamation trial after an earlier jury determined he had sexually abused a columnist in the 1990s, but the session was canceled due to a juror's illness.\n\nTrump was joined onstage Monday night by three of his former opponents who have now endorsed him: South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. The show of force -- interrupted several times by climate change protesters, who were shouted down and removed -- is part of a broader effort by Trump's team to lock up the primary and demonstrate the party is rallying around him.\n\n\"Every day the Republican Party is becoming more and more unified,\" Trump told several hundred people in a steamy, packed hotel ballroom just hours before the first votes were to be cast. \"Now is the time for the Republican Party to come together. We have to unify.\"\n\nHe alluded to former Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' departure from the race on Sunday but didn't name him.\n\n\"And I think one person will be gone, probably tomorrow,\" he said, alluding to Haley.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake also spoke before Trump took the stage.\n\nOn paper, Trump had seemed more vulnerable in New Hampshire than in any other early voting state on the primary calendar. Though voters here supported him by a wide margin in 2016, the state has long been known for its moderate tradition, including allowing unaffiliated voters to participate in GOP primaries. And Haley had been on the rise, prompting Trump's campaign and its allies to spend millions trying to blunt her momentum.\n\nThalia Floras, a former Democrat who manages retail stores, changed her voter registration to undeclared last fall and plans to vote in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary against Trump. She says she would support Haley over Biden if given the chance, even though she has never before voted for a Republican presidential candidate.\n\nBut she said she was worried the primary was \"a long shot\" with not enough support for Haley among traditional conservatives to beat Trump.\n\n\"What do the Republicans want?\" Floras asked at a packed Haley rally over the weekend. \"Are they diehard Trump or do they want the White House?\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspending his bid turned the state into the one-on-one contest between Trump and Haley that she and a long line of anti-Trump Republicans had said they wanted.\n\nBut some evidence suggests Trump could be better positioned to capitalize on DeSantis' exit than Haley. According to AP VoteCast, DeSantis supporters in Iowa overwhelmingly described themselves as conservative and Trump outperformed Haley 53% to 13% among that group.\n\n\"Be careful what you wish for,\" Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita told The Associated Press about Haley making it to a two-person race.\n\nDeSantis immediately endorsed Trump upon dropping out, saying it was clear to him Republican voters preferred the former president.\n\nNever before has a presidential candidate won primary contests in both Iowa and New Hampshire and failed to secure the party's presidential nomination.\n\n\"If she doesn't win here, there's no path for her whatsoever going forward,\" said James Blair, national field director for the Trump campaign. \"Republicans control the nominating process. They are with Donald Trump, growing every day. We see consolidation all over the place since Iowa.\"\n\nTo help get out the vote, Trump's team says it has amassed a team of 2,000 volunteers, including 250 town captains throughout the state.\n\n\"If it's a double-digit win, then, I mean, that is a New Hampshire blowout of epic proportions, especially given all of the time and money she spent here,\" Blair said.\n\nHaley's campaign has been lowering expectations for New Hampshire after insisting for weeks that an outright victory against Trump was possible.\n\n\"Beating Donald Trump is not easy. He is a juggernaut,\" Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney said at a weekend event hosted by Bloomberg. \"But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We have to continue to show incremental growth and progress. We are the last man -- woman -- standing against him.\"\n\nTrump's confidence comes even as influential Republicans in the state like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu warn of dire political consequences.\n\n\"I'm tired of losing, I'm tired losers and I'm sure as hell tired of Donald Trump!\" Sununu shouted late Sunday at Haley's rally in the town of Exeter.\n\nOn Monday, Haley spoke on \"New Hampshire Today\" with host Chris Ryan and compared Trump to Biden, bringing up how Trump has confused her with former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, mistakenly said he ran against former President Barack Obama, and warned about Biden leading the country into World War II, which was fought between 1939 and 1945.\n\n\"When you have two 80-year-olds running for president, you are going to see decline,\" she said. \"It's natural. It's what happens.\"\n\nStill, the thousands of voters who have packed into Trump's New Hampshire rallies in recent days don't seem to be worried and he makes little effort to lower expectations.\n\nEric Holmstrom, a 43-year-old Republican from Goffstown who supports Trump, said he sees the former president's back-and-forth travel from the courtroom to campaign events as a sign of why he's the best person to be the party's nominee.\n\n\"I mean, this guy's stamina is unmatched. And that's -- we need strength,\" Holmstrom said. \"We need unity. We need strength. And we need stamina. And right now, the unity isn't there but it's happening.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nAdriana Gomez Licon contributed to this report from Miami, and Price reported from Manchester, New Hampshire.", "source":

For any 40-year-old readers, we hope you are in as good a shape as Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, who spent his 40th birthday carrying weights in a physical gauntlet with a YouTube fitness influencer.\n\nUp to Speed\n\nBiden Campaign Courts Minority Voters by Highlighting Health Care\n\nIn a series of upcoming campaign stops and new advertising buys, President Joe Biden will attempt to shore up support from minority groups in battleground states with a focus on health care, campaign officials told reporters Tuesday.\n\nBiden will travel to multiple swing states this month with campaign stops intended to pitch black, Hispanic, and Asian voters. Today, the president is visiting Gateway Technical College in Racine, Wisconsin. On May 19, he will both speak to the Detroit chapter of the NAACP and give the commencement address at Morehouse College, the historically black school in Atlanta.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visited Detroit Monday to promote the administration's economic agenda in front of a \"primarily Black crowd,\" according to the Detroit Free Press. Harris will visit Philadelphia Wednesday, while first lady Jill Biden is also getting in on the battleground travel with a trip to Arizona this week to hold an \"Educators for Biden Harris\" event. In addition, the campaign has held local organizing events in the states Biden is targeting to mobilize the Democratic base.\n\n\"Many of these events have and will continue to focus on health care,\" Biden campaign aide Quentin Fulks said on a call with reporters Tuesday. \"While Donald Trump is trying to rip away health insurance from millions of Americans, President Biden is lowering drug costs. We see that message resonating strongly across the diverse communities that make up the Democratic Party.\"\n\nIn addition to the travel, the campaign has reserved a $14 million ad buy, which includes a seven-figure investment in reaching minority voters. One spot the campaign released Wednesday, titled \"Terminate,\" attacks Trump for his past calls to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Trump last month said he was \"not running to terminate\" the law).\n\n\"Health care should be a basic right, folks,\" Biden says in a clip from a rally included in the ad. \"He's coming for your health care, and we're not gonna let it happen.\"\n\nPart of the campaign's messaging on health care will be to highlight abortion bans in several states, from which Trump has attempted to distance himself. Abortion was the subject of the first two ads of the campaign's buy, premiering last week. One features a Marine and father of three daughters who attacks Trump for his pro-life actions as president. Another highlights the story of a Texas woman who fled the state to get an abortion.\n\nBiden campaign officials on the call contrasted their significant media efforts and sizable ground operation with those of the Trump campaign, which, as they highlighted, has little of either at the moment.\n\n\"The undecided voters who are going to be crucial here require repeated and consistent outreach,\" said Michael Tyler, another Biden campaign aide. \"So, while we're targeting these critical voters and telling a consistent story about Donald Trump's attacks on things like reproductive freedom, his plans to rip away Americans' health care, the Trump team ... is hoping for the best while they spend their free time on a golf course or elsewhere.\"\n\nBiden has thus far consistently outperformed Trump in fundraising, and the Biden campaign officials said on Tuesday's call they possess a $119 million war chest.\n\nOn the other hand, although Biden last month appeared to be cutting into Trump's lead in polling, the former president is leading by 1.2 percentage points nationally in the RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nHaley Voters Are Hanging Around\n\nDonald Trump cruised to victory in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary in Indiana, winning about 78 percent of the vote. But despite suspending her campaign two months ago, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley put up another relatively strong performance against Trump, earning roughly 22 percent of the nearly 590,000 votes in the GOP primary -- her best showing in two months.\n\nThe GOP nominating contest effectively ended March 12, when Trump won primaries in Georgia, Mississippi, and Washington state, securing more than the 1,215 delegates he needed to become the party's presumptive 2024 standard bearer. But Haley has continued to earn a small but significant amount of support. In Pennsylvania's April 30 primary, closed to just registered Republicans, the former South Carolina governor received more than 16 percent of the vote. In fact, since dropping her bid the day after the March 5 Super Tuesday primaries, Haley has won at least 10 percent of the vote in 13 state primaries.\n\nHaley diehards can't take too much solace in her overperformance, since practically every contest since Super Tuesday has distributed delegates on a winner-take-all basis. She's won just two delegates since then (from the Rhode Island primary on April 2) and would have no opportunity to challenge Trump for the nomination at the convention.\n\nBut the small rump of Republican primary voters resistant to Trump this late in the game may be worrisome for the former president. That's particularly true in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia -- crucial states for Trump to win back and where he will need to claw back every available Haley voter into his camp by November. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is trying to seize on the opportunity to scoop up potentially disaffected Haley Republicans.\n\nSince suspending her campaign, Haley has stayed fairly quiet and declined to endorse Trump.\n\nShe has posted about politics and foreign policy periodically on her social media pages, and both Haley and her super PAC have periodically sent out emails to her fundraising list, suggesting she may see a possible future for herself in Republican politics. One email last week from Haley's political action committee, Stand for America PAC, includes a screenshot of an Instagram post in which she criticizes universities for not being more forceful against unlawful demonstrators.\n\n\"Please take one minute to read Nikki's post and tell us what you think,\" reads the email, with a link to her fundraising page.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Today, the president is visiting Gateway Technical College in Racine, Wisconsin. On May 19, he will both speak to the Detroit chapter of the NAACP and give the commencement address at Morehouse College, the historically black school in Atlanta.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visited Detroit Monday to promote the administration's economic agenda in front of a \"primarily Black crowd,\" according to the Detroit Free Press. Harris will visit Philadelphia Wednesday, while first lady Jill Biden is also getting in on the battleground travel with a trip to Arizona this week to hold an \"Educators for Biden Harris\" event. In addition, the campaign has held local organizing events in the states Biden is targeting to mobilize the Democratic base.\n\n\"Many of these events have and will continue to focus on health care,\" Biden campaign aide Quentin Fulks said on a call with reporters Tuesday. \"While Donald Trump is trying to rip away health insurance from millions of Americans, President Biden is lowering drug costs. We see that message resonating strongly across the diverse communities that make up the Democratic Party.\"\n\nIn addition to the travel, the campaign has reserved a $14 million ad buy, which includes a seven-figure investment in reaching minority voters. One spot the campaign released Wednesday, titled \"Terminate,\" attacks Trump for his past calls to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Trump last month said he was \"not running to terminate\" the law).\n\n\"Health care should be a basic right, folks,\" Biden says in a clip from a rally included in the ad. \"He's coming for your health care, and we're not gonna let it happen.\"\n\nPart of the campaign's messaging on health care will be to highlight abortion bans in several states, from which Trump has attempted to distance himself. Abortion was the subject of the first two ads of the campaign's buy, premiering last week. One features a Marine and father of three daughters who attacks Trump for his pro-life actions as president. Another highlights the story of a Texas woman who fled the state to get an abortion.\n\nBiden campaign officials on the call contrasted their significant media efforts and sizable ground operation with those of the Trump campaign, which, as they highlighted, has little of either at the moment.\n\n\"The undecided voters who are going to be crucial here require repeated and consistent outreach,\" said Michael Tyler, another Biden campaign aide. \"So, while we're targeting these critical voters and telling a consistent story about Donald Trump's attacks on things like reproductive freedom, his plans to rip away Americans' health care, the Trump team ... is hoping for the best while they spend their free time on a golf course or elsewhere.\"\n\nBiden has thus far consistently outperformed Trump in fundraising, and the Biden campaign officials said on Tuesday's call they possess a $119 million war chest.\n\nOn the other hand, although Biden last month appeared to be cutting into Trump's lead in polling, the former president is leading by 1.2 percentage points nationally in the RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nDonald Trump cruised to victory in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary in Indiana, winning about 78 percent of the vote. But despite suspending her campaign two months ago, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley put up another relatively strong performance against Trump, earning roughly 22 percent of the nearly 590,000 votes in the GOP primary -- her best showing in two months.\n\nThe GOP nominating contest effectively ended March 12, when Trump won primaries in Georgia, Mississippi, and Washington state, securing more than the 1,215 delegates he needed to become the party's presumptive 2024 standard bearer. But Haley has continued to earn a small but significant amount of support. In Pennsylvania's April 30 primary, closed to just registered Republicans, the former South Carolina governor received more than 16 percent of the vote. In fact, since dropping her bid the day after the March 5 Super Tuesday primaries, Haley has won at least 10 percent of the vote in 13 state primaries.\n\nHaley diehards can't take too much solace in her overperformance, since practically every contest since Super Tuesday has distributed delegates on a winner-take-all basis. She's won just two delegates since then (from the Rhode Island primary on April 2) and would have no opportunity to challenge Trump for the nomination at the convention.\n\nBut the small rump of Republican primary voters resistant to Trump this late in the game may be worrisome for the former president. That's particularly true in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia -- crucial states for Trump to win back and where he will need to claw back every available Haley voter into his camp by November. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is trying to seize on the opportunity to scoop up potentially disaffected Haley Republicans.\n\nSince suspending her campaign, Haley has stayed fairly quiet and declined to endorse Trump.\n\nShe has posted about politics and foreign policy periodically on her social media pages, and both Haley and her super PAC have periodically sent out emails to her fundraising list, suggesting she may see a possible future for herself in Republican politics.

Jean, Tish or Fani who end Trump's political aspirations. It might be a woman named Nikki.\n\nYou remember Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who took on Trump in the Republican primary a million years ago -- or earlier this year?\n\nWell, despite dropping out of the race after Super Tuesday, her ghost continues to haunt Trump in some very significant and, for him, ominous ways.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Indiana Republican primary voters unsurprisingly awarded Trump all 58 of their delegates. But somewhat surprisingly, more than 20% of them voted against him. While he handily won 78.3% of the vote, the 128,000 Republican voters who instead pulled the lever for Nikki Haley sent the presumptive nominee a serious message: \"We are not with you.\"\n\nLest you think that an anomaly, late last month 83.4% of Republicans in Pennsylvania voted for Trump. But significantly, 16.6% -- or roughly 158,000 -- voted for Haley.\n\nThis was all after Haley had officially dropped out of the race.\n\nNeedless to say, Trump should be very concerned.\n\nFor one, there's the bad optics of a former president losing as much as 20% of his base to someone who is no longer running.\n\nBut, obviously, there's also the math. In as tight a general election as this is turning out to be, Trump simply can't afford to lose that much of his base.\n\nIn 2020, the battleground states that determined the fate of the election were decided by even fewer voters than the groups currently going for Haley.\n\nIn Michigan, Joe Biden beat Trump by just 154,188 votes. In Arizona, Biden won by only 10,457 votes. In Georgia, you remember, Trump asked the secretary of state to \"find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,\" in order to overturn the election.\n\nFor Trump those are some tight -- and terrifying -- margins.\n\nThere are likely myriad reasons why a not insignificant number of Republicans are still refusing to back him. Some are sick of the chaos, the trials, the constant drama, distractions, and unseriousness. Others are turned off by Trump's MAGA acolytes in Congress, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert, who consistently embarrass the party.\n\nBut there's evidence a single issue is helping to drive those numbers: abortion.\n\nAccording to a recent Wall Street Journal poll of seven battleground states, 39% of suburban women \"cite abortion as a make-or-break issue for their vote -- making it by far the most motivating issue for the group.\"\n\nAnd, \"nearly three-quarters of them say the procedure should be legal all or most of the time, and a majority thinks Trump's policies are too restrictive.\"\n\nConsidering Trump keeps bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade, it's not likely he can win those voters back.\n\nIt's a question as to whether he's even trying, in fact.\n\nWhile he's attempted to mitigate the blowback from a number of unpopular legislative wins against abortion rights by punting the issue rhetorically to the states, he's explicitly told Haley voters he doesn't want them.\n\nAfter she won 43% of the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary, Trump warned, \"Anybody that makes a 'Contribution' to Birdbrain [Nikki Haley], from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don't want them, and will not accept them...!\"\n\nSo the big question looms: where do these voters go if Trump isn't trying to win them back? Will they stay home? Vote for Biden? RFK Jr?\n\nThey have a plethora of options other than holding their nose and voting for him. Believe it or not, despite dropping out, Nikki Haley might just be the woman standing between Trump and the White House.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "s_e_cupp@nydailynews.com", "name": "S.E.

Wow! That's gotta sting for Trump. That's like a boss telling you, \"Sorry, we're passing you over for the promotion and giving it to Mark, may he rest in peace.\" Haley emerged as a critic of the former president while on the campaign trail.\n\nEven after dropping from her campaign, she has consistently achieved a surprisingly large portion of the vote, such as 16.6% in Pennsylvania. This was even more astonishing as it is a state where the margin was less than 1.2% in 2020. She has not endorsed Trump, but President Joe Biden's campaign has been attempting to attract her supporters.\n\nABC News reported that Haley's presidential bid continues to receive substantial support in state primaries since she withdrew from the race in March. This support for Haley indicates an enduring dissatisfaction among party voters with the former president.\n\nHaley found her strongest support in Indiana's urban and suburban counties, securing 35% of the vote in Marion County, which includes Indianapolis, and over one-third of the vote in Hamilton County, a suburban area. Like in other states, her performance was strongest in the most Democratic-leaning areas of the state.\n\nThe Trump campaign, without providing evidence, suggested that Haley's support primarily came from Democrats and expressed confidence in carrying Indiana in November, as they did in 2016 and 2020. Newsweek also reported Christopher Borick, a professor of political science, who gave his analysis of the situation.\n\nHe said, \"Nikki Haley's significant share of the vote in the GOP primary in Pennsylvania is an absolute warning sign for Trump. Her 16 percent share of the vote is quite a signal for the Trump campaign that they have work to do in shoring up the Republican base in a crucial battleground.\" Borick noted that Haley's strongest support came from suburban areas, particularly among affluent and well-educated Republicans who have considerable reservations about Trump. \"In 2020, those Philadelphia suburbs played a pivotal role in propelling Biden to a fairly narrow victory, and the results in the primary indicate a challenging landscape for Trump to navigate this year,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, despite spending a significant amount of time in a New York courtroom facing state criminal charges, Trump continues to secure victories in primary elections. In other news, Stormy Daniels testified in former President Trump's hush money trial, recounting the night she claims to have had a physical encounter with him, as reported by ABC News. The adult film star, who testified under subpoena, stated that she first met Trump at the Lake Tahoe Golf Tournament in 2006 when she was 27 years old. Trump has consistently denied the alleged affair. Daniels also mentioned in her testimony that Trump proposed she appear on The Apprentice.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Apprentice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/692518/uploads/141bff00-0ddc-11ef-a3d4-7db49ffa4e88_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549281", "eventUri": "eng-9549281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

But he's not sure how far he'll go to support her if she wins the nomination.\n\nAnderson, a 73-year-old independent voter from Jackson, liked what he heard from Nikki Haley at the Mount Washington Hotel. But he disagrees with the former U.N. ambassador's plan to pardon former President Donald Trump if he is convicted of any of the crimes he's been charged with.\n\n\"That bothers me,\" he said. \"I'll still vote for her in the primary, but I'll wait to see if she's still saying that in the general election.\"\n\nHaley's best shot at shaking Trump's grip on the Republican nomination rests with her ability to attract New Hampshire's independent voters -- including some who might not stick with her in November -- without alienating too many conservatives. Other Republicans have hit the right balance here, notably John McCain in two GOP primary victories. But those wins came long before Trump's rise in politics and the Republicans' rightward shifts both in the state and nationally.\n\n\"It's a very difficult needle to thread,\" said Nathan Shrader, an associate professor of politics at New England College, \"because if she makes too much of an overt play for the independent voters, that could be a turnoff for some of the Republicans who we know in the Trump era are more conservative than they might have been a generation ago.\"\n\nDemocrats can't vote in the GOP primary, but voters unaffiliated with a party -- who make up nearly 40% of registered voters in New Hampshire -- can. That makes them a key target, though they aren't a monolith.\n\nA CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Sunday found that a majority of registered Republicans likely to vote in the primary -- 67% -- said they planned to vote for Trump. But a majority of those registered as undeclared -- 58% -- said they support Haley.\n\nThe poll, taken Tuesday through Friday, also found more registered Republicans in the state view Haley unfavorably (47%) than favorably (31%). Trump, meanwhile is viewed favorably by 76% of registered Republicans and unfavorably by just 16%.\n\nHaley was viewed favorably by 42% of people who have registered themselves as undeclared, while 32% viewed her unfavorably. Just 34% of the same group, by contrast, views Trump favorably, compared with 59% unfavorably.\n\nThe poll was published before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race Sunday afternoon.\n\nSome Haley supporters interviewed at her events are left-leaning voters who have little ideological overlap with Haley but are intent on stopping Trump. Others lean Republican and agree with her policies.\n\nCorinne Pullen is a blend of both. Pullen, a retired 68-year-old nurse from Canterbury, said she's impressed with Haley's \"strict and strong\" foreign policies and her plans to decrease federal spending. She considers Trump a \"narcissistic braggadocio buffoon.\"\n\n\"When I compare these two candidates, it is a no-brainer who I would feel comfortable and safe having in the White House,\" she said.\n\nTrump has turned that crossover appeal into an attack line, suggesting that Haley is being propped up by \"radical left Democrats.\" The former president's campaign argues Haley will struggle with conservatives in closed primaries like that of her home-state South Carolina, where the Feb. 24 primary is the next big matchup for her and Trump.\n\n\"Her entire focus at this point in time ... has been about turning out Democrats and behavioral Democrats to hijack the Republican primary in New Hampshire,\" Trump senior advisor Chris LaCivita told reporters this month.\n\nAs if to underscore that point, Trump on Saturday arranged for South Carolina's current governor, lieutenant governor, and several other elected leaders to come to New Hampshire to campaign with him. The day before, he won a rousing endorsement from South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, whom Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor.\n\nHaley, however, dismissed that move.\n\n\"I won South Carolina twice as governor,\" she said recently. \"I think I know what favorable territory is in South Carolina. We are going to South Carolina. We're going to be strong in South Carolina.\" She added: \"The road is never going to stop here in New Hampshire, that's always been the plan.\"\n\nDante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, is skeptical that Haley can pull together a strong and diverse enough coalition to top Trump in Tuesday's primary. Even if she did, \"how do you duplicate that elsewhere?\" he asked. \"The answer is, you don't. I don't think you can pull off that magic trick in state after state.\"\n\nUnlike McCain, who openly appealed to \"Republicans, independents, Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians, all of them,\" Haley doesn't mention independents in her stump speech. But the super PAC backing her is filling its mailboxes with fliers citing her endorsement from New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Trump critic, and her plans on the economy and debt reduction.\n\nHaley described herself to reporters Thursday as \"a conservative that knows how to talk to moderates and independents and not make them feel bad, but make them feel included.\"\n\nAt the same time, she pushed back against criticism from Trump and DeSantis that she isn't conservative enough.\n\n\"Show me where I'm moderate, because I'm not,\" she said.\n\nThat didn't stop Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican who voted for Biden in 2020, from endorsing her on Saturday and urging New Hampshire voters to \"showcase their deep-rooted independent streak.\" And it doesn't bother independent voter Kristen Mansharamani, who described herself as \"further left\" than Haley on abortion, education and other issues but said she believes Haley would be a unifying leader.\n\n\"I told my 12-year-old son that I am looking for the person who I think is going to get rid of some of the standstill and the polarization in politics and I think she can do that better than anyone else out there right now,\" said Mansharamani, 48, of Lincoln.\n\nIn Iowa, Haley was the top candidate for the most anti-Trump Republicans, including those who said the former president did something illegal in one of the pending criminal cases against him, according to data from AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of likely Iowa voters before they entered the caucuses.. Two-thirds of Haley's caucusgoers said they would not ultimately vote for Trump in the general election.\n\nIn New Hampshire, some anti-Trump independents supporting Haley say they aren't sure whether they'd back her in a general election either.\n\nAmy Watson, a 59-year-old oral surgeon from Hollis, praised Haley's tenure as U.N. ambassador and governor but said Haley's views on environmental issues may be a dealbreaker in November.\n\n\"As things transpire, I think I'm going to consider what she has to say,\" she said. \"I'm very much concerned about global warming, so that's one area where she may lose me.\"\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nAP Director of Public Opinion Research Emily Swanson in Washington, Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Joseph Frederick in New Hampshire, and

Ouch. This was Donald Trump's present from Indiana Republicans last night after he managed to survive Stormy Daniels' day in court -- her first. She will return on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nikki Haley's winning streak has continued. She dropped out two months ago but that did not prevent her from pulling 17.8% of the primary vote in Arizona, 13.2% in Georgia and 16.1% in Kansas. And then last night was the real crusher, 21.7% in Indiana. And don't forget 43.2% in New Hampshire. Clearly, there's a pattern and there's a message here:\n\nTuesday night as the Indiana results were still coming in but pretty much solidified, David Nir, publisher of Daily Kos Elections, asked, \"Is Nikki Haley getting *more* popular? Right now, she's at 21.6% in Indiana with more than 70% reporting. If it holds, that would be her best showing since dropping out after Super Tuesday.\"\n\nSarah Longwell, publisher of The Bulwark, replied, \"No. It doesn't have much at all to do with Nikki Haley. It's that the broadest coalition in American politics is the anti-Trump coalition.\"\n\nAmanda Carpenter, a Republican political commentator who once worked for far-right GOP lawmakers including Senators Ted Cruz and Jim DeMint, agrees with the anti-Trump theory.\n\n\"It's almost as if...more and more Republicans, each day, are rejecting Trump. Perhaps these [Indiana] voters heard what their former congressman and Governor and later Vice President Mike Pence had to say about the president he served?\" she wrote. \"In all seriousness though, this is not a Nikki Haley movement showing up in double digits in multiple states. It's anti-Trump GOP voters. Can you hear them yet? This is real.\"\n\nAnd yes, there is nothing new about the \"zombie vote\" which is voting for a candidate that's not in the race. The salient question is, what becomes of those votes that go to the zombie? Do they automatically go to the frontrunner? Or, do people stay home or what? Donald Trump seems to think that 1. There aren't that many Haley voters and 2. They'll fall right into line behind him. Mebbe. Mebbe not. Mebbe they'll vote for Joe Biden.\n\n\"For Mr. Trump,\" the Times adds, \"what matters is how many of Ms. Haley's primary voters will rally behind him come November. Polls have shown that her supporters are likely to say they will vote for Mr. Biden. Even so, those same polls often find that many of those voters already supported Mr. Biden in 2020.\"\n\nHere's the bottom line: If the anti-Trump coalition is as virulent and unswayable as these numbers seem to indicate, then he will be toast in November. Trump needs all the Republican votes and he needs any Independent votes that he can possibly muster. If disillusioned Republicans either stay home or show up and vote for Biden, he's gone. Trump may bluster about winning in a landslide but the numbers bear out the fragmentation in his own party.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ursula_faw@politizoom.com", "name": "Ursula Faw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Longwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Longwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bulwark_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bulwark (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Carpenter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amanda Carpenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_DeMint", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim DeMint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Kos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Kos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://politizoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/anti-Trump.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549281", "eventUri": "eng-9549281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Here's what that means for Trump ahead of the general election.", "body": "Donald Trump is on cruise control to formally win the GOP presidential nomination in Milwaukee. But ex-UN Ambassador Nikki Haley continues to rack up votes despite her March exit from the primary. Across the country, there's been a notable bloc of GOP primary voters who aren't backing Trump.\n\nIndiana, which catapulted the political careers of conservatives like former vice presidents Mike Pence and Dan Quayle, is one of the most Republican states in the country.\n\nSince 1940, the state has voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every election except for 1964 and 2008. And former President Donald Trump is virtually assured of winning the state this November, as he also did in 2016 and 2020.\n\nBut an interesting thing happened on Tuesday: Trump won the GOP presidential primary, but former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley still won over 20 percent of the vote, despite her March exit from the race.\n\nWith nearly all precincts reporting their results, Trump earned 461,663 votes (78.3 percent) to Haley's 128,168 votes (21.7 percent).\n\nSimilar to results in states like Virginia and North Carolina, Trump performed strongly in Indiana's rural counties. However, the former president still has a suburban problem, as evidenced by his numbers in the Indianapolis area, with many moderates and GOP-leaning independents continuing to be leery of his 2024 candidacy.\n\nIn Marion County -- which is consolidated with Indianapolis and is the most populous jurisdiction in the state with more than 965,000 residents -- Trump only beat Haley by 30 points (65 percent to 35 percent).\n\nThat's a significant drop-off from Trump's nearly 57-point statewide margin, and it's especially notable since the former president has been the presumptive nominee for weeks.\n\nAnd in suburban Hamilton County, a longtime GOP stronghold which has seen its Democratic vote share soar in recent years, Trump only won by 32 points (66 percent to 34 percent).\n\nIn the general election, Biden is favored to win Marion, a county that he carried by a 63 percent to 34 percent margin over Trump in 2020. Meanwhile, Hamilton County will be more of a battleground, as Trump only won it by seven points (52 percent to 45 percent) that year.\n\nSo while Trump might see the Indiana victory as a mere formality ahead of the RNC convention in Milwaukee, the national suburban trend is a glaring sign for the former president in an election where the margins are expected to be close in the key battleground states.\n\nWhile Indiana may be safely Republican in November, suburban voters in Hamilton County will likely vote in a similar manner to other marginally-Republican and swing jurisdictions that will decide the election.\n\nTrump has sought to tout his economic message to these sorts of voters, an area where he has found success in poll after poll. But many suburban voters are also concerned about issues like the preservation of democracy, abortion rights, and environmental policy, which all strongly favor Biden.\n\nAnd it could give the ex-president a good deal of trouble, especially if he doesn't court Haley's voters ahead of the fall election.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_l_dorman@businessinsider.nl", "name": "John L.

Todd Young (R-IN), former chairman of Senate Republicans' campaign arm, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) suggested Trump's running mate could become the future of the party and present an opportunity to win over Haley voters.\n\n\"The population we need to be going after is this 17% of people that are not voting for President Trump in a primary even though Nikki Haley is not even in the primary,\" Marshall said. \"There's a group of Republicans out there that will play the long game. They want to know who's going to be the president after President Trump.\"\n\nSince Haley dropped out in early March after losing all but one state in Super Tuesday's primary races, she's still managed to clinch 13%-18% of the GOP electorate in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The results have raised questions about whether her supporters in November will side with Trump or if they're willing to snub the ex-president by voting across party lines or sitting out the presidential contest altogether.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been courting Haley voters, with his campaign cutting ads in places like Pennsylvania that highlight Trump's derogatory nicknames and rhetoric about his former Republican opponent.\n\nDespite warnings from some in the GOP not to treat Haley voters as a foregone conclusion for Trump in the general election, other Republicans -- including potential vice presidential picks -- are banking on her supporters ultimately sticking with the party or playing little role.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Sens. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) -- all names on Trump's vice presidential short list -- downplayed the notion that his running mate will have a significant impact.\n\n\"I know the media is obsessed about this [Haley's primary support], but look at the general election polls, Trump is sweeping,\" Stefanik told the Washington Examiner. \"He has over 90% of support among Republicans when it polls for the general election. ... You see a cratering of support [for Biden] among Democrats.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nVance characterized votes for Haley as \"protest ballots\" from those who were never going to support Trump in a primary and put little stock in the value of recent election results.\n\n\"My personal view is that Donald Trump's going to win no matter who he picks,\" Rubio said. \"He was the president before. People are going to vote based on that, but I think the criteria he said publicly is the right one, which is someone who's ready to be president.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence played a key role in Trump's 2016 victory and helped bolster his standing among evangelical voters with more traditional conservative values that contrasted the former president's more populist and unpolished rhetoric.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a close ally to Trump, said he would approve of any vice presidential candidate who \"understands his agenda\" but who also \"makes him more competitive.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) pleaded for Trump to choose anyone but a GOP senator for fear of handing a seat to Democrats in a special election, such as when Democrat Doug Jones was elected in 2017 to the seat vacated by then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who became Trump's attorney general.\n\nIn addition to Rubio and Vance, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is among Trump's top candidates.\n\nPotential picks outside of Congress include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who went on as senator to twice vote to convict Trump in Senate impeachment trials, has vowed not to vote for him in the election. He predicted Trump has more to lose than gain with his eventual running mate.\n\n\"I think a VP loses votes, perhaps, but doesn't get you new votes,\" Romney told the Washington Examiner. \"I don't think he's going to be looking for a Nikki Haley-type VP.\"\n\nMarisa Schultz contributed to this report.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Todd Young (R-IN), former chairman of Senate Republicans' campaign arm, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) suggested Trump's running mate could become the future of the party and present an opportunity to win over Haley voters.\n\n\"The population we need to be going after is this 17% of people that are not voting for President Trump in a primary even though Nikki Haley is not even in the primary,\" Marshall said. \"There's a group of Republicans out there that will play the long game. They want to know who's going to be the president after President Trump.\"\n\nSince Haley dropped out in early March after losing all but one state in Super Tuesday's primary races, she's still managed to clinch 13%-18% of the GOP electorate in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The results have raised questions about whether her supporters in November will side with Trump or if they're willing to snub the ex-president by voting across party lines or sitting out the presidential contest altogether.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been courting Haley voters, with his campaign cutting ads in places like Pennsylvania that highlight Trump's derogatory nicknames and rhetoric about his former Republican opponent.\n\nDespite warnings from some in the GOP not to treat Haley voters as a foregone conclusion for Trump in the general election, other Republicans -- including potential vice presidential picks -- are banking on her supporters ultimately sticking with the party or playing little role.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Sens. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) -- all names on Trump's vice presidential short list -- downplayed the notion that his running mate will have a significant impact.\n\n\"I know the media is obsessed about this [Haley's primary support], but look at the general election polls, Trump is sweeping,\" Stefanik told the Washington Examiner. \"He has over 90% of support among Republicans when it polls for the general election. ... You see a cratering of support [for Biden] among Democrats.\"\n\nVance characterized votes for Haley as \"protest ballots\" from those who were never going to support Trump in a primary and put little stock in the value of recent election results.\n\n\"My personal view is that Donald Trump's going to win no matter who he picks,\" Rubio said. \"He was the president before. People are going to vote based on that, but I think the criteria he said publicly is the right one, which is someone who's ready to be president.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence played a key role in Trump's 2016 victory and helped bolster his standing among evangelical voters with more traditional conservative values that contrasted the former president's more populist and unpolished rhetoric.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a close ally to Trump, said he would approve of any vice presidential candidate who \"understands his agenda\" but who also \"makes him more competitive.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) pleaded for Trump to choose anyone but a GOP senator for fear of handing a seat to Democrats in a special election, such as when Democrat Doug Jones was elected in 2017 to the seat vacated by then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who became Trump's attorney general.\n\nIn addition to Rubio and Vance, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is among Trump's top candidates.\n\nPotential picks outside of Congress include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who went on as senator to twice vote to convict Trump in Senate impeachment trials, has vowed not to vote for him in the election. He predicted Trump has more to lose than gain with his eventual running mate.\n\n\"I think a VP loses votes, perhaps, but doesn't get you new votes,\" Romney told the Washington Examiner. \"I don't think he's going to be looking for a Nikki Haley-type VP.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramsey_touchberry@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ramsey Touchberry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Marshall_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Marshall (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Republican_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House Republican Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

While 78 percent is a resounding victory in most elections, in Tuesday's Indiana primary, it's less impressive considering that Mr. Trump is running unopposed. Ms. Haley received more than 100,000 votes -- about 22 percent of the vote -- in the Indiana Republican primary, even though she dropped out of the race in early March.\n\nMs. Haley's campaign, which has been conspicuously active on social media even after she dropped out, touted the results in a post, saying, \"Thank you, Indiana\" and noting she received \"significant voter share in the Indiana suburbs.\"\n\nFormer staffers for the Haley campaign, like the campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, also remarked on the results, with Ms. Ankney posting: \"I remember people claiming that Nikki wouldn't even be on the ballot in Indiana.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign reacted similarly, posting a montage of voters who once supported Ms. Haley indicating that they plan to vote for Mr. Biden, with one voter saying, \"I can't associate myself with the Republican Party under Donald Trump.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who is often quick to celebrate a victory, has been so far silent on the primary results, though he has been active on Truth Social since the results came in. He may, though, get the chance to weigh in on future results similar to those in Indiana, despite the limited number of Republican nominating competitions left on the calendar.\n\nThe next primaries will be held on May 15 in Maryland, Nebraska, and West Virginia. While there's been no primary polling in Nebraska and West Virginia, anti-Trump Republican primary voters could come out in force in Maryland. A survey from early April by OpinionWorks, the Baltimore Sun, and the University of Baltimore found that Ms. Haley enjoyed 18 percent support in the state compared to Mr. Trump's 74 percent.\n\nA week after the Maryland primary, Republicans in Kentucky and Oregon will go to the polls and, though there's been no data out of Oregon of late, a Morning Consult survey showed significant support for Ms. Haley, 16 percent, in early February.\n\nThe final set of presidential primaries set to be held on June 4 includes Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota. While Ms. Haley's campaign never got a foothold in Montana, and there's been no data out of New Mexico, Ms. Haley could garner support in the other states.\n\nA New Jersey Morning Consult survey from early February found that Mr. Trump enjoyed 82 percent support to Ms. Haley's 17 percent.\n\nA Victory Insights survey of South Dakota Republicans found Mr. Trump enjoyed just 52 percent support earlier this year. It was the only survey of the state this year, and it's not clear how voter's opinions there have changed since it was conducted in early January.\n\nWhile there might be a few more rounds of unfavorable headlines for Mr. Trump's campaign left in the primaries, the bigger question is how Ms. Haley's supporters will vote in November.\n\nThe problem with 2024's uncompetitive primaries is that they have left analysts with little data to parse, including on the topic of how Ms. Haley's supporters are planning to vote in the general election.\n\nExit polling from Ohio found that nearly half of Ms. Haley's supporters, 47 percent, said they'd back Mr. Biden and another 32 percent said they wouldn't vote in the presidential election.\n\nThe exit polls found that a full 18 percent of Republican primary voters said they wouldn't support Mr. Trump if he were the nominee, with 10 percent saying they'd back Mr. Biden and 8 percent saying they'd sit out the election.\n\nWhile that's significantly higher than the 6 percent of Republicans who backed Mr. Biden in 2020, it's only one state, and, given that there was little exit polling conducted this year, it's not clear how it compares to other states.\n\nThere are also comparisons to be drawn between the continued support for Ms. Haley and the \"uncommitted\" vote in the Democratic primaries. The \"uncommitted\" vote, largely organized to protest Mr. Biden's policies in the Middle East, reached its apex in Minnesota, where 19 percent of Democratic primary voters voted \"uncommitted\" in protest against Mr. Biden.\n\nSimilar to the situation with Ms. Haley's supporters, it's unclear how most \"uncommitted\" voters plan to vote in November, as there hasn't been the usual robust exit polling to shine light on this subsection of Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_payne@nysun.com", "name":

Ambassador Nikki Haley, will be able to eat into his margin -- or pull off an upset outright. Haley has dedicated significant time and financial resources to New Hampshire, hoping to appeal to its famously independent-minded electorate.\n\nTrump won New Hampshire's Republican primary big during his first run for president in 2016, but some of his allies lost key races during the midterms two years ago. Haley also has to contend with an opponent who has a deep bond with the GOP base and has concentrated on winning the state decisively enough that it would effectively end the competitive phase of the Republican primary.\n\nIf successful, Trump would be the first Republican presidential candidate to win open races in Iowa and New Hampshire since both states began leading the election calendar in 1976 -- a clear sign of his continued grip on the party's most-loyal voters.\n\nTrump's allies are already pressuring Haley to leave the race and those calls will intensify if he wins New Hampshire easily. Were she to drop out, that would effectively decide the GOP primary on its second stop, well before the vast majority of Republican voters across the country have been able to vote.\n\nHaley has been campaigning with New Hampshire's popular Republican governor, Chris Sununu, a Trump critic. She insists she's in the race for the long run, telling supporters at a VFW hall in Franklin on Monday that \"America does not do coronations.\"\n\n\"This is about, do you have more of the same, or do you want someone who's going to take us forward with new solutions,\" Haley told reporters, also saying that, \"We can either do the whole thing that we've always done and live in that chaos world that we've had, or we can go forward with no drama, no vendettas and some results for the American people.\"\n\n\"This is a two-person race,\" she added.\n\nHaley and Trump were both hoping to capitalize on high-profile recent departures from the race. Haley could get a lift from some supporters of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who campaigned around decrying Trump but ended his bid shortly before Iowa's caucus last week. Trump, meanwhile, may be able to consolidate support from conservative voters who were supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dropped his White House bid on Sunday.\n\nTrump, who appeared at a pre-primary rally in Laconia with one of his former primary rivals, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, was already looking ahead to being the race's last Republican candidate. Asked during a Monday interview with Newsmax about Haley possibly abandoning her campaign after New Hampshire, the former president said he'd never call on her to do that but added, \"Maybe she'll be dropping out Tuesday.\"\n\nScot Stebbins Sr., who attended Trump's rally in a Make America Great Again baseball cap, called him \"the greatest president we've had since Abraham Lincoln\" adding that Trump \"has done nothing but good for our nation.\"\n\nStebbins said he thought the four criminal cases and 91 felony counts Trump is facing constituted \"a witch hunt\" and said Trump would \"get rid of all the corrupt politicians who have been in there too long that are getting paid off.\"\n\n\"He can't be bought,\" Stebbins said. \"He's a true American. He always has been.\"\n\nDemocrats were also holding a primary Tuesday, but it was unlike any in recent memory.\n\nBiden championed new Democratic National Committee rules that have the party's 2024 primary process beginning on Feb. 3 in South Carolina, rather than in Iowa or New Hampshire. He argued that Black voters, the party's most reliable constituency and a critical part of his win in South Carolina that revived his 2020 primary campaign after three opening loses, should have a larger and earlier role in determining its nominee.\n\nNew Hampshire's Democrats, citing state laws dictating that their state hold the nation's first primary after Iowa's caucus, defied the revamped order and pushed ahead with their primary as scheduled.\n\nBiden didn't campaign here and his name won't be on the ballot, meaning the state's Democrats can vote for the president's two little-known major primary challengers, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson. Still, many of New Hampshire's top Democrats backed a write-in campaign that they expect Biden to handily win.\n\nSome voters who might otherwise back Democrats could also vote in the more-competitive Republican primary if they are undeclared.\n\nKaren Padgett is an undeclared voter who saw Haley on Monday. She said she'd voted for Trump in the last two elections but didn't plan to do so again but also is \"really annoyed with Joe Biden that he kind of wrote New Hampshire off.\"\n\n\"Her statement is everybody's so old there, they're so entrenched,\" Padgett said of Haley's promises to shake up Washington in ways that Trump pledged to, but never did. \"Let's get some new people in there.\"\n\nInstead of focusing on New Hampshire, Biden was joining Vice President Kamala in northern Virginia for a rally in defense of abortion rights, which Democrats see as a winning issue for them across the country in November.\n\nThere's nonetheless a growing sense of inevitability around November being a reprisal of Biden versus Trump. Both men have been criticized by their opponents over age -- Biden is 81, Trump 77 -- and each has painted the other as woefully unfit for another White House term.\n\nPublic opinion polls suggest most Americans oppose a rematch. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll in December found that 56% of U.S. adults would be very or somewhat dissatisfied with Biden as the Democratic nominee -- and 58% felt the same about Trump as the GOP pick.\n\nSome New Hampshire voters expressed similar frustration.\n\nJeff Caira, 66, a Republican from Sanbornton, said he was undecided in the primary but that he wanted a candidate who will tackle \"the issues, rather than address the baggage that the other two candidates seem to have.\"\n\nHe said he was \"disappointed\" that as large as the U.S. is, \"the two front-runners are the best we have to offer.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nWeissert reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Joseph Frederick in Franklin, New Hampshire, Mike Pesoli in Laconia, New Hampshire, and Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n-- -- --\n\nFollow the AP's

However, the former president still has a suburban problem, as evidenced by his numbers in the Indianapolis area, with many moderates and GOP-leaning independents continuing to be leery of his 2024 candidacy.\n\nIn Marion County -- which is consolidated with Indianapolis and is the most populous jurisdiction in the state with more than 965,000 residents -- Trump only beat Haley by 30 points (65 percent to 35 percent).\n\nThat's a significant drop-off from Trump's nearly 57-point statewide margin, and it's especially notable since the former president has been the presumptive nominee for weeks.\n\nAnd in suburban Hamilton County, a longtime GOP stronghold which has seen its Democratic vote share soar in recent years, Trump only won by 32 points (66 percent to 34 percent).\n\nIn the general election, Biden is favored to win Marion, a county that he carried by a 63 percent to 34 percent margin over Trump in 2020. Meanwhile, Hamilton County will be more of a battleground, as Trump only won it by seven points (52 percent to 45 percent) that year.\n\nSo while Trump might see the Indiana victory as a mere formality ahead of the RNC convention in Milwaukee, the national suburban trend is a glaring sign for the former president in an election where the margins are expected to be close in the key battleground states.\n\nWhile Indiana may be safely Republican in November, suburban voters in Hamilton County will likely vote in a similar manner to other marginally-Republican and swing jurisdictions that will decide the election.\n\nTrump has sought to tout his economic message to these sorts of voters, an area where he has found success in poll after poll. But many suburban voters are also concerned about issues like the preservation of democracy, abortion rights, and environmental policy, which all strongly favor Biden.\n\nAnd it could give the ex-president a good deal of trouble, especially if he doesn't court Haley's voters ahead of the fall election.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Trump's 2016 primary win helped cement his front-runner status, and he boasts support from all of the state's top elected leaders and all but one of its congressional Republicans.\n\nBut Haley has maintained that her ability to stick it out in the race, having outlasted a dozen also-ran candidates, means that she's in it for the long haul. Her amped-up fundraising could keep her going despite her earlier losses to Trump.\n\nPart of Haley's argument is her continued showcase of her foreign policy knowhow, having served as Trump's United Nations ambassador for two years, as more and more of her campaign appearances feature areas in which she says she would have acted differently than her former boss.\n\n\"I will absolutely put the hammer on our NATO countries that they do have to carry their weight, but you do that behind closed doors,\" Haley said Sunday during a town hall on Fox News with John Roberts, broadcast from a venue in downtown Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nIt was a reference to Trump's warning to NATO allies during a campaign rally earlier this month that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to countries that are \"delinquent\" -- nations that in his view are not doing their part in that alliance. NATO's leader said Trump's attacks on long-standing international alliances and foreign aid could undermine security and put American and European forces at risk.\n\n\"We should make sure we tell our partners it's in their best interest to hold their own weight,\" Haley said Sunday. She said \"Trump did it by saying he was going to encourage Putin to invade our allies. That's the wrong way.\"\n\nShe sharpened those comments during a Monday morning campaign stop in the central South Carolina city of Sumter, home to an Air Force base as well as many military veterans. She said Trump is \"siding with a thug\" in Vladimir Putin, whom she called \"a dictator who killed his political opponents.\"\n\nIt's an argument she makes in a new television ad, part of a $6 million advertising flurry Haley has released in the final weeks of the campaign across her state.\n\nIn \"Unite,\" which begins airing Monday and was shared before its launch with The Associated Press, Haley argues she is the only choice among the remaining candidates who can handle disputes with foreign leaders in a way that will keep America on solid footing abroad.\n\n\"When your enemies think you're weak, your leader must be strong,\" a narrator says, over images of foreign leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin. \"When your country is divided, your president must unite us.\"\n\nThe ad argues that Haley \"provided moral clarity during our darkest hours,\" over headlines from coverage of the racist slaying of nine Black parishioners at a Charleston church in 2015, during Haley's second term as South Carolina governor. \"What's next? That's up to you.\"\n\nSaying Sunday -- as she has throughout her campaign -- that she's \"OK being the underdog now,\" Haley has been firm in saying that she has never lost a race and believes voters will see her as the right choice to shift away from the \"chaos\" she says follows Trump. She also frequently notes that, while Trump has won the earliest contests, she has been ascendant, pointing to the shrinking margins between her totals and Trump's in the Iowa and New Hampshire contests.\n\nBut over the weekend, Haley also began making an appeal to South Carolinians who typically vote in Democratic primaries, for Saturday's vote, a message she also echoed during campaign events on Monday.\n\nShe noted that anyone who didn't vote in the Feb. 3 Democratic primary -- which attracted under 5% of eligible voters statewide -- can vote in this one, as she bid for crossover support from people who want to cast a vote against Trump.\n\n-- -- --\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news",

But New Hampshire has a more moderate political tradition and primary rules that allow unaffiliated voters to participate in the race. Trump-backed MAGA candidates have struggled here in recent years.\n\nHaley, the former U.N. ambassador and onetime South Carolina governor, is hoping to capitalize on those vulnerabilities, especially now that she is the only major candidate left in the GOP primary aiming to defeat Trump outright. DeSantis, even before dropping out altogether, had effectively surrendered New Hampshire to focus instead on South Carolina's Feb. 24 primary. But he did have supporters in New Hampshire who now must decide what to do.\n\nA Haley victory would usher in a more competitive phase of a primary that Trump has so far dominated. A Trump win, however, could create a sense of inevitability that he would become the GOP nominee for the third consecutive time.\n\nDon't forget Democrats have a primary, too. President Joe Biden is not on the ballot, having made South Carolina the first formal stop on the Democratic primary calendar. But New Hampshire is sticking to tradition and hosting its own Democratic primary anyway.\n\nIf Haley can't beat him in New Hampshire, she may not be able to stop him anywhere else, even in her home state of South Carolina.\n\nThe one-on-one fight between Trump and Haley is exactly what Trump's Republican critics have been clamoring for. Haley appears competitive and enjoys support among moderate voters and independents. She's also earned the backing of popular New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu.\n\nStill, Trump remains the favorite.\n\nSensing a knock-out blow, the former president has called in his growing army of prominent supporters in recent days to help demonstrate his strength. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Trump's former opponent, endorsed Trump at a New Hampshire rally over the weekend. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Ohio Sen. JD Vance stumped for Trump on Saturday before an appearance from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.\n\nA significant number of New Hampshire Republicans insist they will never support Trump. And without a competitive Democratic primary in the way, many left-leaning unaffiliated voters could decide to support Haley. But that doesn't change the fact that Republican primary elections are typically decided by Republicans, and Trump's grip on the base appears stronger than ever.\n\nStill, New Hampshire loves a comeback story (just ask Bill Clinton), so we wouldn't rule anything out.\n\nWHERE DO DESANTIS SUPPORTERS GO?\n\nDeSantis was seen as a distant third-place finisher in New Hampshire even before ending his campaign Sunday.\n\nThe Florida governor visited the state for the first time as a major 2024 primary candidate in June. After his 30-point drubbing in Iowa, where DeSantis had committed most of his time and resources, he surrendered New Hampshire before a single vote was cast. DeSantis actually spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina, which hosts its primary election in five weeks.\n\nBut dismal poll numbers don't mean DeSantis had no support at all in New Hampshire. With him having aimed for the most conservative factions in the GOP coalition and then endorsing Trump, it's possible his formal departure adds votes to the former president's vote totals. Could that be the difference between Trump managing a narrow victory over Haley or garnering a clear majority that he then uses to declare the nomination a done deal before Haley gets her home-state shot at him?\n\nHOW MUCH DOES ELECTABILITY REALLY MATTER?\n\nPublicly and privately, Democratic leaders have repeatedly acknowledged that they fear Haley much more than Trump in a prospective general election matchup against Biden. We're about to find out whether Republican primary voters agree.\n\nHaley has spent months telling voters that, without Trump's chaos and political baggage, she would be better positioned to defeat Biden in November. That argument didn't help her much in Iowa, where she finished just behind DeSantis.\n\nShe's betting that voters in swing-state New Hampshire will place more value on her longer-term political appeal. Sununu, New Hampshire's popular GOP governor, has been at Haley's side for weeks reminding voters of Trump's dismal record in national elections ever since he entered the White House.\n\nIt's unclear if the message has resonated.\n\nIf it doesn't, it'll be because Trump has effectively convinced Republican voters that he -- not Haley -- is the most electable general election candidate. That's a risky bet, given his extraordinary legal problems, the attack he inspired on the U.S. Capitol and his demonstrated record of alienating suburban voters in successive elections.\n\nBiden's unpopularity is no doubt muddying the issue.\n\nStill, New Hampshire voters have an opportunity to cast a strategic vote Tuesday based on the one issue that seems to matter more than all else in today's politics: the ability to beat the other side.\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT\n\nThe end result may be tied most to who actually shows up to vote on Tuesday.\n\nIowa saw one of its lowest turnouts in recent history in last week's caucuses. Low turnout elections typically favor the candidate with the strongest support among the party's base. And in 2024, that's Trump.\n\nBut Haley, with arguments about Trumpian chaos and electability, has been trying to appeal to independents and less-ideological moderate Republicans and independents.\n\nNew Hampshire law allows unaffiliated voters to participate in either party's nomination contest. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the GOP primary, although voters had an opportunity to change their registration before an October deadline.\n\nHaley needs a large turnout, driven by those unaffiliated voters, to have a chance.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State David M. Scanlan predicted that 322,000 voters would participate in the GOP primary, which would be a record high. On the Democratic side, he's expecting just 88,000 given there's virtually no competition.\n\nA PRESIDENTIAL EMBARRASSMENT?\n\nIt may not be the headline, but New Hampshire Democrats are voting for their presidential nominee as well. As much as Biden's team wants you to think they don't care about the outcome, they're paying attention.\n\nBiden won't be on New Hampshire ballot, of course.\n\nHe's avoiding New Hampshire altogether after pushing the Democratic National Committee to award the nation's opening primary to South Carolina, a much more diverse state that's set to vote on Feb. 3. Furious about Biden's decision, the \"Live Free or Die\" state ignored the president's wishes and will host an unsanctioned Democratic primary anyway.\n\nThere are several lesser-known Democrats on the ballot, including Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and progressive activist Marianne Williamson. Eager to demonstrate Biden's strength despite his absence, the president's allies in the state have been encouraging voters to write in Biden's name.\n\nThe outcome will have no bearing on the number of delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination. But an underwhelming finish, even in a write-in campaign, would represent an unwanted embarrassment as Biden tries to improve his political standing heading into the fall campaign.\n\n-- --

Nikki Haley or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to be his running mate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn an interview on NewsNation's \"Elizabeth Vargas Reports,\" Kelly noted that Trump is \"not that popular\" among a significant share of the Republican base, pointing to his recent poor showing in the Indiana GOP presidential primary, where he got 78 percent of the vote, despite being the only candidate left in the race. Haley ended her campaign two months ago, but still got 22 percent.\n\n\"Well, you may not have heard that Trump is not that popular with a core segment of the Republican Party,\" Kelly said, responding to the results of the Indiana primary returns.\n\nShe recognized Trump is unlikely to pick Haley or DeSantis - his chief opponents in the 2024 primary race - but she encouraged the former president to pick a vice presidential candidate with similar appeal.\n\n\"He should pick a running mate that will represent that faction of the party, that is not core MAGA, that's a little bit more establishment,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"That's the truth about most Republicans now,\" she continued. \"While they would still vote for Trump, most are not core MAGA.\"\n\nKelly said Trump \"should get a DeSantis type\" of candidate, adding, \"I realize he is probably not going to pick Haley, but he should get somebody like that for his VP pick.\"\n\nThe race to be Trump's running mate has been heating up in recent weeks, as Trump has used the audition process to launch an army of surrogates flooding the airwaves to defend him and echo his talking points as he remains tied up in a Manhattan courtroom.\n\nTrump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, has maintained a growing shortlist of potential vice presidential candidates that includes Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R), Sen. J.D.Vance (R-Ohio), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), among others.\n\nHaley and DeSantis are both absent from the list after a bitter primary battle. Haley did not endorse Trump when she suspended her campaign for president, and DeSantis gave a lukewarm endorsement of the former president.\n\n\"It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,\" the governor said in his speech ending his campaign. \"While I have had disagreements with Donald Trump such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden.

And Nikki Haley, who dropped out one million years ago, still managed to pull 17 percent of the vote.\n\nThis has been pretty consistent, Haley winning 14 or 18 percent, even after she dropped out. But at this point, she dropped out a LONG TIME AGO.\n\nAnd in Indiana last night, Nikki Haley won 20 percent. Bad news for Joe Biden and RFK's literal brain worm! (It can't be bad news for Trump because nothing is ever.)\n\nOh wait, did we say 20 percent? That must be because we typed that before we read the most updated count. We meant she's sitting at 21.8 percent with more than 95 percent of the vote counted.\n\nJK, we'd say Donald Trump has a problem. Maybe a bunch of voters like candidates who aren't perennial losers who are currently charged with one million felonies, and with one criminal trial that's (miraculously, it turns out) actually begun.\n\nIf you take a closer look at the results in Indiana, you notice that Haley's vote is much bigger in the central counties where humans outnumber cows. In some of those areas, she's pulling in fully 35 percent of the vote. So that's just more evidence of the urban/rural divide in the US, and the fact that MAGA is mostly a rural white nationalist movement. (Politico notes that the two counties in question -- Marion, where Indianapolis is, and Hamilton, the northern Indy suburbs -- are places where Joe Biden really upped the Democratic numbers in 2020.)\n\nOverall, over 128,000 people came out in Indiana's Republican primary -- long after the primary was sewn up -- to say fuck Donald Trump.\n\nAnd yes, Indiana is what's known as a \"partially open\" primary state, but any MAGA Republican placing their hopes in the idea that this result came about because of Democrats who put in the effort to vote in the Republican primary yesterday is what's known as an idiot.\n\nI have profiles those other places but I think I forgot how to log on.", "source": {"uri": "wonkette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonkette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_hurst@wonkette.com", "name": "Evan Hurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Have an account? Log in.\n\nBut an interesting thing happened on Tuesday: Trump won the GOP presidential primary, but former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley still won over 20 percent of the vote, despite her March exit from the race.\n\nWith nearly all precincts reporting their results, Trump earned 461,663 votes (78.3 percent) to Haley's 128,168 votes (21.7 percent).\n\nSimilar to results in states like Virginia and North Carolina, Trump performed strongly in Indiana's rural counties. However, the former president still has a suburban problem, as evidenced by his numbers in the Indianapolis area, with many moderates and GOP-leaning independents continuing to be leery of his 2024 candidacy.\n\nIn Marion County -- which is consolidated with Indianapolis and is the most populous jurisdiction in the state with more than 965,000 residents -- Trump only beat Haley by 30 points (65 percent to 35 percent).\n\nThat's a significant drop-off from Trump's nearly 57-point statewide margin, and it's especially notable since the former president has been the presumptive nominee for weeks.\n\nAnd in suburban Hamilton County, a longtime GOP stronghold which has seen its Democratic vote share soar in recent years, Trump only won by 32 points (66 percent to 34 percent).\n\nIn the general election, Biden is favored to win Marion, a county that he carried by a 63 percent to 34 percent margin over Trump in 2020. Meanwhile, Hamilton County will be more of a battleground, as Trump only won it by seven points (52 percent to 45 percent) that year.\n\nSo while Trump might see the Indiana victory as a mere formality ahead of the RNC convention in Milwaukee, the national suburban trend is a glaring sign for the former president in an election where the margins are expected to be close in the key battleground states.\n\nWhile Indiana may be safely Republican in November, suburban voters in Hamilton County will likely vote in a similar manner to other marginally-Republican and swing jurisdictions that will decide the election.\n\nTrump has sought to tout his economic message to these sorts of voters, an area where he has found success in poll after poll.

Traitor Tot sewed up the nomination in March, and the last viable challenger, Nikki Haley dropped out nine weeks ago. Trump is on the glide path to the nomination.\n\nSo why, with all of those other factors already known, dud 1 out of every 5 Hoosiers still go into the booth and pull the lever for Nikki Haley? That's right, Haley got 20% of the vote. Hell, in some GOP suburban strongholds, her haul was as high as 32-35%. And it isn't just Indiana, Haley's haul has been consistent throughout the ptimaries, even after she dropped out.\n\nLook, right now 10-12% of Biden primary voters are voting undeclared instead. But there's a reason for that. They're not saying that they won't vote for Biden in November, they're trying to light a fire under the administration's ass to change their policy on Israel and Gaza. They're making a statement. But Traitor Tot has no admini9stration, and no policies or governance plans. The Haley protest voters are not trying to make a point. What they're doing is flipping Trump double barrel birds. They're done, and he's toast.\n\nAnd El Pendejo Presidente has nobody to blame but himself. After all, Familiarity breeds contempt. For the last nine long years, there is no more contemptable of a pig that not just the United States, but the entire world has become so familiar with. And that's because Trump's gigantic ego requires that he and he alone be under the brightest spotlight. Trump's ego and thirst for glory were so overpowering that he almost immediately stomped all over his few accomplishments by trampling everybody else out of the way. And his never ending scandals really were never ending, since his imbecilic attempts at damage control only kept diging the holes bigger.\n\nPersonally, I wrote Trump's political epitaph shortly after the 2020 election was called for Biden, and I haven't changed my mind. For one simple reason. Most informed voters cast their ballots for two reasons in some kind of a blend. They vote for a combination of their own self interest, and in order to make a point.\n\nWhich brings us to 2018. In 2016, Russian help notwithstanding, Il Douche was powered by a bloc of low propensity democratic, GOP, and Independent voters who took a chance on change. By 2018 they were already long gone, victims of trump fatigue, and sick of the juvenile drama queen bullsh*t.\n\nWhich left the moderate GOP base, especially white suburban women voters and their spouses. And in 2018 they sent a message, and the message was Enough of the racist, sexist, nihilistic misogynistic bullsh*t! They empowered a 40 seat blue tsunami in the House that ensured that Trump spent his last two lame duck years fighting off impeachment hearings and trials. One would think the message was received.\n\nIf so, then how do you explain 2020. Trump was back on the ballot. But the soft Democratic, GOP, and Independent voters either sat this one out, or voted for Biden. But white suburban women GOP voters came out in force with another message, NO MORE TRUMP! They voted for more traditional GOP down ballot races, but either voted for Biden, or left the top slot blank. As a result Trump lost by more than double his losing margin in 2016.\n\nIn 2022, Glorious Bleater was a memory, although still already running for the 2024 nomination. So another message had to be sent, and this time the white suburban women voters were putting the GOP on notice. The Democrats kept the Senate, and the GOP garnered such a puny majority in the House they would be incapable of governing. The message was twofold, NO MORE TRUMP, and BIPARTISANSHIP! What the hell, Biden and the Democrats with an identical or smaller margin did it for two years.\n\nI am struck by the last two lines of the iconic Don McLean ballad Vincent, They would not listen, they're not listening still. Perhaps they never will. How many damn times do the same voters have to keep sending the same damn message. The soft Democratic, GOP, and Independent Trump voters of 2016 were gone by 2018, and they're sure as hell not coming back now. Moderate suburban white GOP women voters warned the GOP in 2018, bounced Trump's sorry ass to the curb in 2022, and issued another stern warning to the GOP in 2022. NO MORE TRUMP! It's time to start the reclamation project that Reince Priebus wanted to begin with the 2012 Autopsy report in 2013.\n\nMost analysts and pundits claim that this election more than most others will be decided by the thinnest of margins in that narrow mushy middle in a handful of swing states. I respectfully disagree. from where I'm sitting, and what I see, the battle for 2024 has already been fought, and trump lost it.\n\nIn 2024 Trump has his worst nightmare, Nikki Haley. Haley is the GOP's 2024 version of Bernie Sanders in 2016. In 2016, the younger, more progressive voters were sick to death of voting for the same old white dudes every four years, they demanded a younger, more progressive power structure in the party itself. And while Bernie Sanders was another old white dude, he was the farthest left progressive the party had, so he became their rallying point for change. And while once it was decided Sanders went balls-to-the-wall for Clinton, some never stopped blaming the whiny Bernie Bro's for the loss.\n\nHaley had a built in advantage, since she isn't an old white dude.Instead she's the highly successful two term Governor of a deep red southern state, and the former US Ambassador to the United Nations. But here's the critical difference. While Haley was never in a realistic position to actually win the 2024 primaries, she was in the [refect position to do exactly what she's done, and continues to do. send yet another message with her solid 20% vote share, The current iteration and ideology of the GOP is incapable of winning a national election. The days of the old guard are coming to a rapid end.\n\nHaley is making a purely political calculation, and I think she's nailing it. 2024 is out of reach, but it's a necessary coupe de grace for the MAGA wing of the party. And by being the only moderate to go toe-to-toe with Trump and openly criticize him, she has earned a solid 20% and put herself in place as the face of the new moderate wing of the updated GOP. Especially if Traitor Tot gets clobbered in November, Haley ois looking towards a new presidential field filled with people like herself, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Will Hurd. Watch for a qhole slew of new memoirs coming to a bookseller near you soon.\n\nHere's why I say that the 2024 election is likely already over. It is true that most elections are decided in critical swing states and districts within the margin of error. But this is not a normal election cycle. Popularity polls show Trump running far behind Biden, he isn't just unpopular, he's hated by the majority of the country. Biden has his flaws, but people don't tend to actively hate him.\n\nThe rest is a simple matter of math and numbers. Nikki Haley has a rock solid 20% base, and they're not going anywhere, otherwise why vote for her in the first place. Even if half of them come home in November, that's still 10% of the GOP voting base either sitting out, or voting for RFK Jr. or Biden, and that's fatal in a razor thin race.\n\nBut there's more. In November, in the critical swing states of Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida, you have abortion rights initiatives on the ballot. Pro abortion initiatives have run the table since the Supreme court overturned Roe. Add to that the fact that there are a slew of pro MAGA retreads on statewide and national races in those states. With the expected surge in pro choice voters hitting the ballot boxes, the last tihng and the GOP can afford is to have even 10% of those Haley voters either sitting out or voting democratic. Personally, properly funded by the national party and grassroots fundraising, I'm not ready to take either Ohio or Florida off of the board this early.\n\nespecially Florida, and here's why. Florida already has a law on the books that requires that citizen ballot initiatives receive 60% of the vote to pass. This could be a death knell for the GOP for two reasons. First, the organizers are already well aware of that extra 10% hurdle, and will be beating the bushes to scrape out every last YES vote. The Haley bloc could be critical there. Second, several years ago, with the 60% law in p-lace, there was an initiative to restore voting rights to non violent criminals who had completed their sentences, parole, and/or probation. It passed with 73% approval. Wi9th the human Skeletor Rick Scott in a dogfight, I'm not giving up on Florida yet either.\n\nWgat goes around comes around. In 2013 Reunce Priebus eagerly wanted to put the Autopsy Report plan into motion, using exactly the disaffected 20% Haley vote to anchor the new party while it disengaged from the Klansmen and refried Jesus wheezers. It was estimated that it would take two federal election cycles to complete the transition. Instead they settled for Trump. And now any transition can't start until at least 2025, and will likely take even longer as they fumigate the remaining MAGA members.

Nikki Haley claimed in the Indiana primary Wednesday night.\n\nHaley dropped out of the 2024 presidential race two months earlier, but that didn't stop one out of five Indiana Republican primary voters from throwing their support behind her, reports show.\n\nThis isn't the first time the former United Nations ambassador took a chunk of votes away from Trump, having claimed 17.8 percent of the

Obviously, this is a state that's reliably red and there's little question about how it will vote in November, regardless of who the nominee is, but Nikki Haley, whose presidential campaign has been effectively dead since the end of March, pulled off her best performance since she suspended her campaign, bringing in nearly 22% of the vote.\n\nShe overperformed with 30-point margins in the suburbs of Hamilton County and Marion County near Indianapolis, where Democrats overperformed their margins in 2020 even with Joe Biden losing the state, indicating that Donald Trump still very much has a suburban problem that isn't clearing up anytime soon, losing areas where the GOP was once very much dominant.\n\nWith 99% of the vote in, Haley will easily clear 100,000 votes, which is actually more support than the winning Republican candidate for lieutenant governor won in the state.

His competitors, meanwhile, were asked by Fox Business moderators at the Ronald Reagan library in California to participate in a reality show-style game where they would write who else onstage they would vote \"off the island.\" They refused.\n\nThe debate's tone was far removed from a campaign that's been driven by Trump's attacks on his rivals and democratic institutions as well as his grievances about a litany of criminal indictments and civil cases targeting him and his businesses. The moderators did not ask about the indictments or why the people onstage were better qualified than Trump, instead posing questions about issues including education, economic policy and the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe candidates often went after Trump on their own, hoping to distinguish themselves at a critical moment with less than four months before the Iowa caucuses launch the presidential nomination process. Trump has continued to dominate the field even as he faces a range of vulnerabilities, including four criminal cases that raise the prospect of decades in prison.\n\n\"He should be on this stage tonight,\" said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is attempting to establish himself as the leading Trump alternative despite recent struggles to break out from the rest of the pack. \"He owes it to you to defend his record where they added $7.8 trillion to the debt. That set the stage for the inflation we have now.\"\n\nSeveral others blistered Trump for not showing up, a departure from the first debate, when the field mostly lined up behind former president. DeSantis said just a few minutes in that President Joe Biden was \"completely missing in action from leadership. And you know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action.\"\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has built his campaign around criticizing Trump, said the former president \"hides behind the walls of his golf clubs and won't show up here to answer questions like all the rest of us are up here to answer.\"\n\nEven Vivek Ramaswamy, the entrepreneur who has declared Trump to be the \"best president of the 21st century,\" distanced himself and argued he was a natural successor.\n\n\"Yes, I will respect Donald Trump and his legacy because it's the right thing to do,\" he said. \"But we will unite this country to take the America First agenda to the next level. And that will take a different generation to do it.\"\n\nTrump gave a lengthy prime-time speech in suburban Detroit that continued into the start of the debate. The crowd booed when he referenced the debate. He joked, \"We're competing with the job candidates,\" and poked fun at his rivals for not drawing crowds as large as his.\n\nEven hours before the debate began in Simi Valley, about 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, the first group of supporters for any campaign to arrive waved Trump flags and put up a banner reading \"Trump, our last hope for America and the world.\"\n\nHis rivals seemed to sense his command over the field on Wednesday and did their best to change the direction of the race.\n\n\"Donald, I know you're watching. You can't help yourself,\" Christie said. \"You're ducking these things. And let me tell you what's going to happen. You keep doing that, no one here's going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're going to call you Donald Duck.\"\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, drew larger crowds and new interest after the first debate. Her team raised expectations prior to Wednesday's debate ahead of an expected campaign swing in Iowa.\n\nHaley didn't single out Trump but instead picked multiple fights with Ramaswamy, as she did in August. She assailed him for creating a campaign account on TikTok, the social media app that many Republicans criticize as a possible spy tool for China.\n\n\"Honestly, every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say,\" Haley said.\n\nHaley also fought with Sen. Tim Scott, her fellow South Carolinian and once her pick to fill the state's open Senate seat. As Scott accused Haley of backing a gas tax as South Carolina governor and upgrading the curtains in her office as United Nations ambassador, Haley responded, \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nAfter a first debate in which he assailed rivals and derided the rest of the field as \"bought and paid for,\" Ramaswamy tried to show a softer side when Haley and others went after him. After Haley's attack on his use of TikTok, Ramaswamy said, \"I think we would be better served as a Republican Party if we're not sitting here hurling personal insults.\"\n\nDeSantis sniped at Ramaswamy and so did Pence, suggesting that he'd failed to vote in many past elections. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum steered clear of Ramaswamy, but repeatedly jumped in to answer questions he wasn't asked to get himself more screen time in the debate's early going. He repeatedly shouted for attention from the left end of the stage, leading a moderator to threaten to cut his microphone.\n\nIn one awkward exchange, two candidates made references to sex in talking about teachers unions. \"When you have the president of the United States sleeping with a member of the teachers union, there is no chance that you can take the stranglehold away from the teachers union,\" Christie said at one point, referencing first lady Jill Biden's teaching career and longtime membership in the National Education Association.\n\nA short time later, Pence turned to Christie: \"I've been sleeping with a teacher for 38 years. Full disclosure.\" His wife, Karen, is a teacher.\n\nThe night concluded with the moderators noting that it was unlikely a divided field could stop Trump, but then asking candidates to say who they would vote off the island, an apparent reference to the \"Survivor\" reality show. The proposed game didn't get far as DeSantis suggested it was insulting.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson was the only candidate not on the second debate's stage after qualifying for the first one. He too headed to suburban Detroit, saying, \"Donald Trump is here in Detroit tonight because he wants to avoid a debate.\"\n\nWednesday's site was symbolic given that Reagan has long been a Republican icon whose words and key moments still shape GOP politics today.\n\nBut in addition to fighting with the library's leaders, Trump has reshaped the party and pushed it away from Reagan. The second debate's participants were largely respectful of all that Reagan stood for -- but also didn't distance themselves much from Trump's major policy beliefs.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, argued the debate didn't matter. Biden was in California at the same time, raising money in the San Francisco Bay Area for his reelection campaign, which at the moment is likely to be a rematch with Trump.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom was in Simi Valley representing the Biden campaign and offering zingers to reporters about the debate, saying it was like a junior varsity or minor league game.\n\n\"This is a sideshow by any objective measure,\" Newsom said in an interview.", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Garden Island"}, "authors": [{"uri":

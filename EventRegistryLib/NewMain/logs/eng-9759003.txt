She is also an attractive woman who dated men before she married Doug Emhoff in 2014. This is the big character assassination plot of the Republican Party: Kamala Harris dated men, she was hot stuff in the 1990s and she's a stepmother. Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance has been particularly focused on Kamala Harris's lack of biological children for several years now, and he's referred to her as a \"childless cat lady\" several times.\n\nSen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, said in 2021 that Vice President Kamala Harris is one of the \"childless cat ladies\" who is \"miserable\" with her life and has no direct stake in America because she is not a mom.\n\nIn a speech at an Intercollegiate Studies Institute conference, Vance specifically named Harris in a tirade against the \"childless left\" who have \"no physical commitment to the future of this country.\" He lumped the vice president in with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\"Why is this just a normal fact of ... life, for the leaders of our country to be people who don't have a personal and direct stake in it via their own offspring?\" Vance said.\n\nDays later, the Ohio Republican doubled down on his attacks on childless Democrats in an interview with then-Fox News' Tucker Carlson.\n\n\"We're effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance said.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact: You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" he said. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people that don't have a direct stake in it.\"\n\n[From HuffPo]\n\nThere are millions of Americans, both men and women, who are childfree by choice or by circumstance and we vote. We have the time to vote. We have the disposable income to donate to the Democratic Party. As a childfree woman with cats, I loathe the suggestion that I don't have a \"personal stake\" in the future of the country. I have fewer rights as a woman than my mother, and that's because of Donald Trump and his MAGA cult, and as a woman... I want to ensure that girls and women have their reproductive rights restored so they are not handmaidens in the Confederacy of Trumplandia.

Anyway, Vance's comments have been making the rounds again because Trump picked Vance as his running mate. Trump's team barely vetted Vance, and Vance has gone down poorly in MAGA world and beyond. Those particular comments about \"childless cat ladies\" have become a real pop culture moment this week, so much so that Jennifer Aniston - a childfree dog mom - decided to chime in:\n\nJennifer Aniston is hitting back at comments about politicians who are \"childless cat ladies\" made by Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, which have recently gone viral.\n\n\"The Morning Show\" star, 55, on Wednesday took to her Instagram Stories and posted a screenshot of a social media post in which Ron Filipkowski, editor-in-chief of the MeidasTouch Network, shared a 2021 \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" interview clip with Vance.\n\n\"JD Vance says women who haven't given birth like Kamala Harris are 'childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives,' and have 'no direct stake' in America,\" Filipkowski wrote alongside the 28-second clip.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" Aniston wrote. \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\n[From USA Today]\n\nThis wasn't even as hard as Aniston could have gone on Vance, given her own personal story. Aniston has been the subject of decades of womb-speculation, and Aniston has very strong opinions on men with opinions on her childfree status.\n\nMeanwhile, this whole \"childless cat lady\" issue is a ticking time bomb for Republicans and I'm not sure they even know how bad it's going to get. Taylor Swift's fans are just waiting for her much-anticipated endorsement so they can unleash hell on Trump and Vance.

Vance Once Called Kamala Harris a 'Childless Cat Lady.' Now Real-Life 'Cat Ladies' Have Thoughts", "body": "Virginia Chamlee is a Politics Writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE for three years. Her work has previously appeared in The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Eater, and other outlets.\n\nComments made by Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance in a 2021 interview are now resurfacing -- and stirring conversation among people who either don't want, or can't have, children.\n\nYears before he was selected as Donald Trump's running mate, Vance gave an interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson in July 2021. During the conversation, Vance said the U.S. was being run, under Democratic leadership, by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. \"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance, 39, told Carlson. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nVance went on to say that those who \"actually have kids\" are \"the people who have a more direct stake in the future of this country.\"\n\nThat Vance, who has three children with wife Usha Chilukuri Vance, called out three \"childless\" Democrats by name is particularly noteworthy -- in part, because it's not true. One of them, Harris, became a stepmom to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children in August 2014. Now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Harris has for years spoken openly about her close relationship with her stepchildren, who refer to her as \"Momala.\"\n\nButtigieg, meanwhile, now the Secretary of Transportation, does have children: twins he adopted with husband Chasten in September 2021, just weeks after Vance's interview aired.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, does not have children. But as critics of Vance's comments have weighed in: so what?\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nFlorida state Rep. Anna Eskamani chided Vance for his comments in a post on X, writing, \"As a childless cat lady I have a huge stake in America and am not miserable but thanks for your concern, Vance.\"\n\nFormer Sec. of State Hillary Clinton, who ran for the presidency against Trump in 2016, wrote sarcastically: \"What a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms,\"\n\nOthers have expressed similar thoughts, questioning why someone without biological children is less invested in the good of the country than someone with children.\n\n\"Calling step-mom Kamala Harris a childless cat lady is going to enrage not just single women but all the parents of step-kids who are having their parenting denigrated,\" one user on X wrote. \" Vance's history of misogyny is just an endless wellspring of hate to highlight.\"\n\nAnother offered a more sarcastic assessment of the Republican's comments, asking: \"Should really help win over women voters, huh?\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Kaitlan Collins this week, Buttigieg noted that the comments directed at him came at a time when he and his husband \"had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.\"\n\n\"[Vance] couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg added.\n\nAnd many others have seized on a very famous cat-owner without kids -- Taylor Swift, sharing photos of her 2023 TIME Person of the Year (on which she appeared alongside one of her cats) in response to Vance's comments.\n\nAs Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi wrote, though, it is possible Vance didn't actually mean what he said back in 2021, especially considering his track record (though now Trump's running mate, he previously called the former president \"America's Hitler\" and called himself \"a never Trump guy.\"\n\nMahdawi cites data that shows that many women who are unmarried and childless aren't unhappy in the slightest -- in fact, the opposite, often ranking higher in terms of health and happiness than those with children.\n\nOthers have simply taken Vance's comments and run with them, espousing Vance's comments as something of a rallying cry.

Vance's daughter to slam his childless women comments", "body": "Jennifer Aniston isn't holding back when it comes to addressing J.D. Vance's resurfaced comments about the misery of childless women, saying she hopes his own daughter will never struggle with infertility or with trying to get pregnant via in vitro fertilization, a procedure that Donald Trump's running mate has voted against making more accessible.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" the \"Friends\" alum wrote on her Instagram Story Wednesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"All I can say is ... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\"\n\nAniston has opened up in the past about trying to conceive via IVF and about dealing with media gossip about her not having children. She continued to cite Vance's 2-year-old daughter Mirabel as she blasted the incendiary comments he made in 2021, when the father of three said that miserable \"cat ladies\" are running the Democratic Party and that people without children have no stake in the country's future.\n\nAniston said: \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" The \"Friends\" alum is referring to Vance, an Ohio senator, joining other Senate Republicans in June to vote down a bill that would have established a nationwide right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology, and would have made these procedures more affordable and accessible.\n\nIn her post, Aniston shared a screenshot of a tweet, which featured Vance's July 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. In the clip, the conservative former venture capitalist can be heard saying the United States was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable in their own lives and with the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance continued, referencing U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York City, in the interview. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nIn his diatribe, Vance falsely characterized Harris and Buttigieg's status as parents. Vice President Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is the stepmother to her husband's son and daughter, while Transportation Secretary Buttigieg and his husband adopted twin newborns in November 2021.\n\nAniston's comments come a week after Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, picked Vance as his vice president at the Republican National Convention ahead of the 2024 election. Vance and his wife Usha share three children, Miracle, 2, Vivek, 4, and Ewan, 6.\n\nThe Emmy-winning actress has previously addressed false rumors that she's dealt with her entire career -- reports that she's pregnant, trying to get pregnant or that she prioritized her career over having children. She told Allure in 2022 that it was \"really hard\" to see the fake reports, while revealing that she had tried to conceive through IVF.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation ... It was really hard,\" Aniston said at the time. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would have given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it.\"\n\nBefore that, she wrote an essay for the Huffington Post in 2016, saying she was completely \"fed up\" with the way that women often face scrutiny if they don't have children after a certain point.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone,\" Aniston wrote. \"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.

She is known to have several cats, including two Scottish Folds named Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey and a Ragdoll cat named Benjamin Button.\n\nAn X post with an image of Swift with a cat is captioned, \"hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate\". Many users took to the comment section, with one of them saying, \"A lot of cat ladies are gonna be mad\". \"So sick of the \"baby factory\" misogyny,\" one user said, while another wrote, \"I hope @taylorswift13 comes out for Kamala and against all these sexist comments from the Trumplican party and Trump himself.\"\n\n\"Do they think that childless single people don't vote?!\" one user wrote, while another said, \"News flash, JD, not all men want kids either. My husband didn't, thank God. We have had lots of cats over the years though. And we're quite happy.\" \"They will go absolutely mad when Swift endorses VP Harris. Just a matter of time. @taylorswift13, how about some concerts in your native PA and also MI, AZ, NC and GA?\" one user wrote.\n\nThe resurfaced clip came after Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. Harris is married to longtime entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff, and has two step-children named Ella and Cole Emhoff.\n\nDuring the conversation with Carlson, Vance also suggested that \"if we want a healthy ruling class in this country, we should invest more, we should vote more, we should support more people who actually have kids. Because those are the people who ultimately have a more direct stake in the future of this country.\"\n\nOn facing backlash for his comments, Vance had said that he believes he \"struck a nerve.\" \"I mean, these people recognize that they're unhappy. They're living in one-bedroom apartments in New York City. They've played their entire lives to win a status game. They're obsessed with their jobs,\" he said, suggesting that they \"hate normal Americans for choosing family.\" Vance also said that these people would be \"happier coming home to a smiling kid\" than \"worrying about their crappy job.\"\n\nHarris, however, has appeared to be perfectly happy in her personal life. She wrote in Elle in 2019, \"I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in.\"\n\n\"A few years later when Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom.'

Vance, who was then running for US Senate in Ohio, said the country was run by Democrats whom he called \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\n\"The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance said, targeting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Vice President Kamala Harris in his comment. \"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" (When Harris married Douglas Emhoff in 2014, she became stepmother to his two children.)\n\nThe attacks from Vance about \"people who don't have children\" -- which he has made publicly more than once -- have reverberated with politicians, media figures, and everyday Americans who've denounced the statements as \"hurtful and mean.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Aniston, who has previously spoken about her fertility struggles, took issue with Vance's comments.\n\n\"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,\" said Aniston, referring to the push by some Republicans to ban access to in vitro fertilization. Her comments came one day before World IVF Day, which recognizes the advancement of the fertility treatment.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Allure, Aniston discussed the difficulties she faced trying to become pregnant, amid constant speculation by the tabloids.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it,\" she said. \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nMeghan McCain, a conservative commentator and the daughter of the late Senator John McCain, also called Vance out for his comments.\n\n\"One of my best friends did rounds and rounds of unsuccessful IVF wanting to have a child. It is still painful to talk about,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"This 'childless women' comment by JD Vance has made so many waves with so many different friends of mine for it's insensitivity and cruelty to women.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/kmGRPGTWfaanwxIotgJN593yEEc=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/4Q7B7OEUIRIOXIJSAKNSMM5W6Q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday night, the Friends actress reshared a video of Vance saying something truly shocking about women that should have us ALL incredibly concerned.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump 'S**tting His Pants' Now That Biden Dropped Out, Say Critics!\n\nAniston took to her Instagram Stories account to share the clip -- and comment on it, too. The video itself was from a 2021 interview Vance did on Fox News with then-anchor Tucker Carlson. During that interview, which took place while Vance was running for Senate, the current VP candidate slammed Democrat politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. The charge? Being childless!\n\nIn that old clip, Vance moaned about how \"childless cat ladies\" are controlling the Democrats, and thus, controlling the country. He said in part to Carlson:\n\n\"It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAnd he went on:\n\n\"[They are] a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nYeesh!\n\nThe 55-year-old sitcom star couldn't abide by that, though. And she used IG to fight back! Sharing a clip of the offensive quote on Wednesday evening, she first wrote above it:\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\"\n\nThen, below the video, Aniston added this particularly poignant follow-up:\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her too\"\n\nWow. Very powerful! And VERY true!! See the post for yourself (below):\n\nHere's the original video of Vance saying those awful words, BTW:\n\nNow, for one, Harris actually does have kids: she's the stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children -- son Cole, 29, and daughter Ella, 25. But oooooookay, JD!\n\nAs for Aniston, the child chat and pregnancy discussion no doubt hits home. She's been plagued by pregnancy rumors throughout her career, and has also tried to bring children into this world, but it never happened for her. Back in November of 2022, she recalled to Allure how difficult it was for her to try to have a baby while with ex-husband Brad Pitt and at other points in her younger years:\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would have given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it.\"\n\nShe also followed up with that outlet at the time:\n\n\"Here I am today. The ship has sailed... I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I?'

Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\"\n\nThe actress, 55, shared a clip of Donald Trump's running mate making the controversial remarks to Tucker Carlson on Fox News in 2021 alongside the post.\n\nIn the interview, Mr Vance describes the Democrats as \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too\".\n\nHe then goes on to name Ms Harris as an example of the party being \"controlled by people without children\". Ms Harris has two step-children with her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nIn the post criticising Mr Vance, Aniston added: \"I hope your daughter will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nAniston's comments appear to be in reference to Mr Vance's voting with senate Republicans to block legislation that would have established a national right to IVF last month.\n\nAniston has previously discussed how she unsuccessfully tried to have children through IVF.\n\n\"It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" the Friends star told Allure in 2022. \"All the years and years of speculation... it was really hard.

He followed the speech with an incendiary interview on Fox News in which he specifically mentioned Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Harris.\n\n\"We're effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance, now a U.S. senator from Ohio, said at the time.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact: You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" he said. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people that don't have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nThe remarks drew wider attention after Trump named Vance as his running mate last week.\n\nIn case anyone missed it, on Thursday the Harris campaign posted a clip of the interview to its 1 million followers on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. And in an email heralding World IVF Day, the Harris campaign said Vance \"is driving away voters in droves, insulting couples struggling with infertility who are sounding off on his disparaging comments about 'childless' women.\"\n\nIn vitro fertilization emerged as a major political issue this year after an Alabama Supreme Court decision put IVF procedures on shaky legal footing. The decision followed the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, the federal right to an abortion, and put Republicans on the defensive. Trump has insisted his would defend IVF if he's elected president.\n\nButtigieg and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, both potential vice presidential picks for Harris, also piped up about the \"cat ladies\" comment on Wednesday.\n\n\"Go ahead and continue to denigrate people. My God, they went after cat people. Good luck with that,\" Walz said on MSNBC. \"Turn on the internet and see what cat people do when you go after them.\"\n\nButtigieg, for his part, told CNN that Vance listed him as a \"childless cat lady\" at a time when he and his husband had had a \"heartbreaking setback\" in their efforts to adopt children.

If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nHarris, who has two stepchildren, is now running for president after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, has adopted twins.\n\nVance went on to say in the clip that he believes people \"who go home at night and see the face of a smiling kid, whatever their profession, I think they're happier, I think they're healthier, and they're going to be better prepared to actually lead this country.\"\n\nAniston also called out Vance over his far-right stance on reproductive rights.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston wrote. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nThe actor told Allure in 2022 that she tried to get pregnant for many years but \"it was a challenging road\" for her.\n\n\"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it,\" she said. \"I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nAniston, 55, said the constant media scrutiny and false claims that she didn't want children because she was \"selfish\" were hurtful.\n\nWhile the actor did not officially back Harris, the Instagram post comes as many in Hollywood have begun publicly broadcasting their enthusiasm for the vice president's campaign.\n\nJosh Gad, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Barbra Streisand and Kerry Washington were among the flood of actors to voice their support. A handful of artists, including Lil Nas X and John Legend, also shared posts on social media backing Harris.\n\nAnd Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who was among the first Democratic donors to publicly urge Biden to step aside, donated $7 million to a super PAC supporting Harris' run, The Information reported.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

She revealed to Allure magazine in 2022 that she had undergone IVF to try to have children when she was in her 30s and 40s, but the attempts did not result in any pregnancies.\n\nThe actress, who is still best known for her role as Rachel Green in Friends, is currently starring in The Morning Show on Apple TV+.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "casey_cooper_fiske@independent.ie", "name": "Casey Cooper-Fiske", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Morning Show (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Audio_and_Video_Clips", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Audio and Video Clips", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/7o18YDGjpzEIPSUppOO5jO4LFS4=/0x616:3552x2984/629x0/prod-mh-ireland/730004fa-d48d-4c00-8637-7609474a22fb/c3b53902-e31d-4773-8dfa-8057af25df50/2.48016389.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Vance's daughter to slam his childless women comments", "body": "Aniston makes it personal while blasting the GOP vice presidential candidate for disparaging women who don't have children and for opposing legislation that would have made IVF more affordable and accessible\n\nJennifer Aniston isn't holding back when it comes to addressing J.D. Vance's resurfaced comments about the misery of childless women, saying she hopes his own daughter will never struggle with infertility or with trying to get pregnant via in vitro fertilization, a procedure that Donald Trump's running mate has voted against making more accessible.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" the \"Friends\" alum wrote on her Instagram Story Wednesday, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"All I can say is ... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\"\n\nAniston has opened up in the past about trying to conceive via IVF and about dealing with media gossip about her not having children. She continued to cite Vance's 2-year-old daughter Mirabel as she blasted the incendiary comments he made in 2021, when the father of three said that miserable \"cat ladies\" are running the Democratic Party and that people without children have no stake in the country's future.\n\nAniston said: \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" The \"Friends\" alum is referring to Vance, an Ohio senator, joining other Senate Republicans in June to vote down a bill that would have established a nationwide right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology, and would have made these procedures more affordable and accessible.\n\nIn her post, Aniston shared a screenshot of a tweet, which featured Vance's July 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. In the clip, the conservative former venture capitalist can be heard saying the United States was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable in their own lives and with the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance continued, referencing U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York City, in the interview. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nIn his diatribe, Vance falsely characterized Harris and Buttigieg's status as parents. Vice President Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is the stepmother to her husband's son and daughter, while Transportation Secretary Buttigieg and his husband adopted twin newborns in November 2021.\n\nAniston's comments come a week after Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, picked Vance as his vice president at the Republican National Convention ahead of the 2024 election. Vance and his wife Usha share three children, Miracle, 2, Vivek, 4, and Ewan, 6.\n\nThe Emmy-winning actress has previously addressed false rumors that she's dealt with her entire career -- reports that she's pregnant, trying to get pregnant or that she prioritized her career over having children. She told Allure in 2022 that it was \"really hard\" to see the fake reports, while revealing that she had tried to conceive through IVF.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation ... It was really hard,\" Aniston said at the time. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would have given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it.\"\n\nBefore that, she wrote an essay for the Huffington Post in 2016, saying she was completely \"fed up\" with the way that women often face scrutiny if they don't have children after a certain point.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone,\" Aniston wrote. \"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@mercurynews.com", "name": "Martha Ross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance Once Called Kamala Harris a 'Childless Cat Lady.' Now Real-Life 'Cat Ladies' Have Thoughts", "body": "Comments made by the Republican vice presidential nominee in a 2021 interview are resurfacing\n\nComments made by Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance in a 2021 interview are now resurfacing -- and stirring conversation among people who either don't want, or can't have, children.\n\nYears before he was selected as Donald Trump's running mate, Vance gave an interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson in July 2021. During the conversation, Vance said the U.S. was being run, under Democratic leadership, by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. \"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance, 39, told Carlson. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nRelated: J.D. Vance Isn't the Bridge-Building VP That Moderates Wanted: What He's Said About Women, Voting and Project 2025\n\nVance went on to say that those who \"actually have kids\" are \"the people who have a more direct stake in the future of this country.\"\n\nThat Vance, who has three children with wife Usha Chilukuri Vance, called out three \"childless\" Democrats by name is particularly noteworthy -- in part, because it's not true. One of them, Harris, became a stepmom to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children in August 2014. Now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Harris has for years spoken openly about her close relationship with her stepchildren, who refer to her as \"Momala.\"\n\nButtigieg, meanwhile, now the Secretary of Transportation, does have children: twins he adopted with husband Chasten in September 2021, just weeks after Vance's interview aired.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, does not have children. But as critics of Vance's comments have weighed in: so what?\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nFlorida state Rep. Anna Eskamani chided Vance for his comments in a post on X, writing, \"As a childless cat lady I have a huge stake in America and am not miserable but thanks for your concern, Vance.\"\n\nFormer Sec. of State Hillary Clinton, who ran for the presidency against Trump in 2016, wrote sarcastically: \"What a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms,\"\n\nOthers have expressed similar thoughts, questioning why someone without biological children is less invested in the good of the country than someone with children.\n\n\"Calling step-mom Kamala Harris a childless cat lady is going to enrage not just single women but all the parents of step-kids who are having their parenting denigrated,\" one user on X wrote. \" Vance's history of misogyny is just an endless wellspring of hate to highlight.\"\n\nRelated: Kamala Harris on Her Marriage, What Keeps Her Up at Night and the Beyonc\u00e9 Song She Calls Her Anthem (Exclusive)\n\nAnother offered a more sarcastic assessment of the Republican's comments, asking: \"Should really help win over women voters, huh?\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Kaitlan Collins this week, Buttigieg noted that the comments directed at him came at a time when he and his husband \"had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.\"\n\n\"[Vance] couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg added.\n\nAnd many others have seized on a very famous cat-owner without kids -- Taylor Swift, sharing photos of her 2023 TIME Person of the Year (on which she appeared alongside one of her cats) in response to Vance's comments.\n\nAs Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi wrote, though, it is possible Vance didn't actually mean what he said back in 2021, especially considering his track record (though now Trump's running mate, he previously called the former president \"America's Hitler\" and called himself \"a never Trump guy.\"\n\nMahdawi cites data that shows that many women who are unmarried and childless aren't unhappy in the slightest -- in fact, the opposite, often ranking higher in terms of health and happiness than those with children.\n\nOthers have simply taken Vance's comments and run with them, espousing Vance's comments as something of a rallying cry. As one social media user put it, the \"childless cat ladies\" might just have their claws out.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nLast month, Vance, along with other Senate Republicans, voted to block Democrat-proposed legislation to guarantee access to IVF nationwide. And during his Senate bid, he lent his support to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and for Texas's ban on abortion.\n\nIn 2022, Aniston shared with Allure magazine that she tried to get pregnant for several years and underwent unsuccessful rounds of IVF.\n\n\"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today,\" she told the magazine, adding that years of speculation from the public and press made it that much more difficult.\n\n\"The ship has sailed.\"\n\nAnd it's not just Aniston who is hitting back at Vance over his past judgments about childless adults - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was criticized by Vance in the clip, addressed the comments earlier this week, speaking about the twins he adopted in 2021 with his husband, Chasten.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg told CNN's The Source.\n\n\"He couldn't have known that -- but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"\n\nOne of Harris's stepchildren (she has two with husband Doug Emhoff) also blasted Vance on Instagram.\n\n\"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I?\" Ella Emhoff, 25, wrote on her Instagram story Thursday, referring to her 29-year-old brother, Cole Emhoff.\n\nShe also shared a screenshotted quote from her mother, Kerstin Emhoff, in which she defended Harris against Vance's controversial comments.\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" Kerstin told CNN Wednesday, calling the Hillbilly Elegy author's comments \"baseless attacks\" on Harris.\n\n\"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective and always present,\" Kerstin continued. \"I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Morning Show (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oligarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nAs you can see above, Aniston included a screenshot of a tweet from Vance's old interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nIn the exchange, the 39-year old said this nation was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nVance even went on to cite Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez... the former of whom is now running for president after Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance told Carlson, adding at the time:\n\n\"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nFor the record, Buttigieg is now the father of two-year old twins.\n\nHarris is also the step-mother of husband Doug Emhoff's two biological kids, Ella and Cole.\n\n\"These are baseless attacks,\" Emhoff's' ex-wife said in a statement to CNN this week.\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nAniston, for her part, told Allure in November 2022 it was \"really hard\" to see the pregnancy rumors that plagued her throughout her career.\n\nAlso, in 2016, misguided pregnancy speculation inspired Aniston to write an essay for the Huffington Post about how irritated she was with them and what they say about those who spread them.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone,\" Aniston wrote back then.\n\n\"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples.\n\n\"Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.\n\n\"We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kay_d_rhodes@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Kay D.

And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nThe comments from Senator Vance, who has four children, did not appear to have been challenged by Carlson, who left Fox News in April 2023 after he apparently angered Rupert Murdoch, who at the time was still the chair of Fox News.\n\nDemocrats have now leapt on the discovery of the video to criticise Senator Vance, and claim he is not suitable to be America's vice president.\n\n\"What a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms,\" Hillary Clinton, who lost the presidential election to Mr Trump in 2016, wrote sarcastically on X.\n\nSenator Vance, a social conservative who was elected to the Senate from Ohio in 2022, has supported a national ban on abortion and positioned himself to the right of Mr Trump.\n\nAs the resurfaced video of Senator Vance emerged, commentators pointed out Ms Harris has two step-children with her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, announced in the summer of 2021 they had adopted twins.\n\nWhen Senator Vance first made his comments, Ms Ocasio-Cortez attacked him, and referred to him having previously worked in venture capital with billionaire Republican Peter Thiel.\n\nShe said: \"When you accidentally let your billionaire funder-talk slip out on TV, you say things like 'a healthy ruling class'\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_buncombe@yahoo.com",

You see, he seemingly thinks very little of women who don't have children.\n\nBack in 2021, Vance gave an interview on Fox News (where else?) and felt the need to call Democrats \"a bunch of childless cat ladies.\" These women are, according to him, \"miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nHe told Tucker Carlson, \"Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandra Ocasio Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nStatements such as these are leveled against female and gay politicians constantly, and it's disheartening and frustrating. It's also inaccurate, because Harris is a parent -- she's a step-parent. She shares two kids with her husband Douglas Emhoff. Just because her children are not her biological children, that doesn't make her \"childless.\"\n\nAnd, speaking as a childless person myself, not having children also doesn't mean you have no direct stake in the future. That's an absurd thing to say. People should, and usually do (I suspect Vance himself is an exception), want to leave behind a better world for future generations, regardless of whether those people share their bloodline or not.\n\nMany people have slammed Vance for his comments (including Pete Buttigieg, who is also now a parent via adoption), but one of the loudest voices has been that of actress Jennifer Aniston.\n\nThere was a time in the not-so-distant past when the media seemed just plain obsessed with Aniston's fertility. Rumors spread that Brad Pitt, her most high-profile ex, left her because she didn't want children ... but this unsurprisingly turned out to be misinformation. Aniston actually did try to become pregnant with IVF in her thirties and again in her forties, but in the end she could not.\n\nAniston wrote a post on Instagram Stories directed at Vance. It read, \"All I can say is ... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nYep ... Vance voted against the Right to IVF Act last month. If you're trying to wrap your head around how he can simultaneously criticize a woman for having no children and also take steps to prevent her from having them, rest assured that I am, too.\n\nAniston also wrote in her post, \"I truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" and many, many people on social media share those same sentiments. Many people have pointed out in response to Vance's comments that first American president George Washington also had no biological children.\n\nAniston has had a long and difficult journey where countless people have seemingly felt entitled to comment on her choices. However, she told Allure magazine in 2022 that she had \"no regrets\" about where she ended up in life. \"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_barrett@themarysue.com", "name": "Sarah Barrett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/jennifer-aniston.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Setting aside for a moment the fact that Buttigieg actually does have kids and that Harris is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children, vice presidential candidate Vance seems to be saying here that women should only be granted power if they have given birth.\n\nAniston, who has had her womb more publicly scrutinized than possibly any other person in Hollywood, had a thing or two to say to that.\n\nIn an Instagram Story posted on July 24, the Friends actor wrote, \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.\" Under a screenshot from the viral video, Jennifer Aniston addressed JD Vance directly, continuing, \"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.

Since he became Trump's running mate, Vance's profile has been significantly enhanced, and several controversial past comments made by the politician have surfaced on social media.\n\nIn one clip, which is from a Fox News interview in 2021, Vance spoke derogatorily about female politicians in America, claiming they are frustrated by not having children, and use politics as a tool to bring others down.\n\nHe said during the broadcast: \"We're effectively run in this country by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nVance continued: \"Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nSince President Biden pulled out of the electoral race, Vice President Kamala Harris has become the favourite to replace him, and Republicans have begun politicising her decision not to have children, which has led to Vance's comments resurfacing.\n\nNow, Jennifer Aniston, who also doesn't have children, has criticised Vance for the remark and expressed her fears about him potentially becoming Vice President following the election in November.\n\nDespite Aniston's desire to have children and attempts at IVF, pregnancy never materialised, which is why she's using her platform to speak for those also in her position.\n\nAniston shared the clip of Vince on Instagram and fearfully wrote: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\"\n\nThe Hollywood star also expressed her worries for Vance's daughter, adding, \"All I can say is... Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nIn 2022, during an interview with Allure, Aniston admitted that \"the ship had sailed\" for having children, and admitted, \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today.\"\n\nEarlier this year, IVF treatment has been under heavy scrutiny in Alabama following a ruling made by the Alabama Supreme Court, which has potentially jeopardised the future of the treatment in the state.\n\nIn the wake of the news, Trump revealed that he's fully supportive of the treatment, and isn't considering a ban, writing on Truth Social, \"Under my leadership, the Republican Party will always support the creation of strong, thriving, healthy American families. We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder!\"\n\nHowever, last month, Vance, voted to block regulation by the Democratic Party which would have guaranteed nationwide access to IVF treatment for women.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/07/Jennifer-Anniston-Actress-2024-Far-Out-Magazine-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 137, "textEnd": 146}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Vance's 'childless cat lady' comment", "body": "Right-wingers online are miffed Jennifer Aniston criticized Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance for claiming in 2021 that the U.S. was being run by \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nAniston weighed in on a re-circulating Fox News clip from 2021 where Vance complained that \"we're effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nVance -- who at the time was running for Senate -- specifically called out Vice President Kamala Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) for not having children.\n\n\"And it's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance said. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nHarris does not have biological children but has been a stepmother for nearly ten years. Buttigieg, at the time of Vance's remarks, was in the process of trying to adopt. The Buttigiegs announced the birth of their adopted twins in September 2021.\n\nThe Friends star wrote on her Instagram story Wednesday: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" she continued. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nIn June, Vance, along with the vast majority of Republican senators, blocked The Right to IVF Act, which would have codified the right to in vitro fertilization and lowered its cost.\n\nRepublicans criticized the bill as an election-year stunt, though Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Katie Britt (R-Ala.) did introduce a competing bill. That bill did not move forward due to opposition by one of The Right to IVF Act's sponsors, who argued it would create burdensome requirements that would force IVF clinics to close.\n\nAniston does not have any children but previously spoke out in a 2022 cover story for Allure about undergoing multiple rounds of IVF.\n\n\"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" Aniston said.\n\nShe added: \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nIn the wake of Aniston's criticism, fans of Vance are hitting back hard -- and some are even targeting the actress for lacking children.\n\n\"Jennifer Aniston is 55 years old, childless, and miserable,\" wrote one X account.\n\n\"LMAO Jennifer Aniston should've found someone when she was in her prime,\" sniped another. \"Too bad so sad.. Have fun with your cats.\"\n\n\"Jennifer Aniston is an attractive woman. She's also got psychological & personality problems,\" someone else asserted. \"That's why every man she's ever entered a relationship with left her & never looked back. Her opinion of Trump & Vance isn't worth shit.\"\n\nRight-wing commentator Ian Miles Cheong took a swipe at Aniston too, saying, \"Oh no, the cat ladies are offended.\"\n\nBut many others did not hesitate to defend Aniston and echo her criticism.\n\n\"Jennifer Aniston has dogs. Not cats,\" quipped one person.\n\n\"I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know - these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends,\" said Meghan McCain. \"These comments have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are.\"\n\nEchoed someone else: \"Childless cat lady rhetoric and going against IVF might just pave the way to lose the elections.

For context, Vance -- who joined Trump's ticket earlier this month -- copped some well-deserved backlash after a video of his interview on Fox News resurfaced overnight.\n\nDuring the interview -- which took place on Tucker Carlson Tonight and dates back to July 2021 -- Vance has some choice words aimed at Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\nVance told Carlson that Democrats including Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are like \"a bunch of childless cat ladies.\" He went on to say that Harris and the like are \"miserable [about] choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nVance concluded the attack by declaring that childless people \"don't really have a direct stake in\" the direction of the country. Just this week, Vance attacked Harris again, saying at a rally in Virginia that she is \"a million times worse\" than Biden.\n\nSetting aside the fact that Harris does, in fact, have two step-children with her entertainment lawyer husband Douglas Emhoff, the unearthed comments were enough to inflame Swift fans, since the singer is famous for her feline friends and is herself a self-described \"cat lady\". Oh, she also starred in the remake of Cats, but we'd prefer to forget that film even exists.\n\nNaturally, Vance's comments prompted a swathe of Swifties to assemble in a fashion akin to The Avengers, warning Vance of the inevitable fallout that now awaits him. \"All the Trump campaign can do is brace for impact,\" one user wrote on X, accompanied by an image of Swift's Time Magazine cover with her cat, Benjamin Button.\n\n\"JD Vance really effed this one up,\" another user quipped, \"The Armageddon is coming for him.\" If there's any group more effective in uniting against a common enemy than Swifties, it's cat ladies themselves. Indeed, Vance's comments also caught the ire of those who simply own a cat, with one pet parent declaring the Ohio senator \"wouldn't be such a miserable jerk\" if he had a furry friend of his own.\n\nVance's anti-cat stance is probably inconsequential for Swift herself since she likely wouldn't have endorsed the Trump campaign, anyway. In 2020, she shared her support for the Biden-Harris ticket, and it's thought she'll rally behind the presumptive nominee once again this year.\n\nWhile she's yet to make any official announcement, the X page Swifties for Harris was launched in the wake of Biden's announcement and has since gained 38,000 followers (none of whom are cats).", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_disalvo@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Tom Disalvo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swift County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Swift County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Taylor-Swift-cat-aldy-JD-Vance-Swifties.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Vance Called Kamala Harris a \"Childless Cat Lady\"?", "body": "Now that U.S. President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the presidential race, his Vice President Kamala Harris appears to be the Democrats' presidential nominee next month at its convention. Being a woman and Black-Indian, she has an uphill battle against arrogant and racist White men like Donald Trump and apparently J.D. Vance, the Republicans choice as president and VP, even though he is married to an Indian woman. But since Harris previously was a prosecutor, and both an attorney general and senator of California, she appears to be more than qualified to answer the loose lip of the likes of Trump and Vance.\n\nHarris gave her first apparent campaign speech yesterday. She hinted at Trump's alleged crimes by declaring, \"I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type.\" Wow! I think Trump should fear this woman. No wonder he says he won't debate her. He's scared of her. So much for the Republicans' braggadocia about debating.\n\nIt now appears that another hurdle for Harris against the Trump-Vance ticket will be her childlessness. It is being reported today that back in 2022, Vance said of Harris on a Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson, \"We're effectively run in this country -- via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs -- by a bunch of childless cat ladies, who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It's just a basic fact.\" Social media is now having a heyday with Vance's \"childless cat ladies.\" And what about all those single women about there who couldn't have kids?\n\nI thought Vance was supposed to be a Christian. What about men who don't have kids? Jesus obviously chose to not marry and thus have children. In Vance's vocabulary, did that make Jesus a \"childless cat man\"? Same with his cousin and forerunner -- John the Baptist. And what about Abraham and his wife Sarah? They would not have had children if it had not been for God supernaturally intervening when they were 100 and 85 years old, respectively, thus too old for Sarah to bear children. Abraham is the original source of the Judeo-Christian faith, and Jesus is Savior and Lord to Christians. Looks like Vance needs to brush up on his biblical history. Would he have called Sarah a \"childless cat lady\" before God came along?", "source": {"uri": "patheos.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Patheos - Seek.

You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning's edition of CNN This Morning, anchor Kasie Hunt led her panel in roasting Vance on a spit over the remarks, with his lone defender immediately surrendering and changing the subject:", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_This_Morning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN This Morning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasie_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kasie Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CNN-Morning-Crew-Beats-Up-On-Trump-And-VP-Pick-Vance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Vance's comments on 'childless cat ladies'", "body": "Jennifer Aniston was critical of remarks made by Sen. J.D. Vance over 'childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives' while speaking about Vice President Kamala Harris in 2021. Aniston, 55, took to Instagram Stories on Wednesday with sharp words for Vance, who is running as Donald Trump 's vice presidential candidate, atop a clip of him speaking with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.\n\n'I truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,' the Friends star said on the social media platform. 'All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. 'I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.'\n\nThe comments Vance made in 2021 questioning Vice President Harris\u00b4 leadership because she did not have biological children resurfaced in recent days, testing the young conservative senator in his early days campaigning as part of the Republicans' presidential ticket. During Vance's bid for the Senate in Ohio , he said in a Fox News interview that 'we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats,' and referred to them as 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u00b4ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.'\n\nHe said that included Harris, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a New York Democrat . Vance said to Carlson in the interview, 'It's just a basic fact - you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC - the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?' Vance, 39, and wife Usha Vance, 38, have three kids - sons Ewan, six, and Vivek, four, and daughter Mirabel, two. Harris became stepmother to two children - Cole, 29, and daughter Ella, 25 - when she married entertainment lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014. Buttigieg announced he and his husband adopted infant twins in September 2021, more than a month before Vance made those comments.\n\nAniston, who can currently be seen on Apple TV+'s The Morning Show, has been candid about her issues with fertility and trying to have a child over the years. Aniston, who was previously in marriages with Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux, chat with the publication Allure in December of 2022 about how she had past sought to have children more than a decade back. Aniston told the publication , 'I would say my late 30s, 40s, I'd gone through really hard [expletive], and if it wasn't for going through that, I would've never become who I was meant to be. 'That's why I have such gratitude for all those [expletive] things. Otherwise, I would've been stuck being this person that was so fearful, so nervous, so unsure of who they were. And now, I don't [expletive] care.'\n\nShe expounded on her feelings, saying she 'was trying to get pregnant' during that timeframe. 'It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,' Aniston said. 'All the years and years and years of speculation ... it was really hard.' Aniston opened up about the multiple methods she explored in her attempts to become pregnant. 'I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it,' Aniston said. 'I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, \"Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.\" You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.' Aniston said things were 'really hard' for her emotionally in the years there were rumors she was pregnant; and the insinuations that she chose her show business career over having children were 'absolute lies.' She said in the 2022 interview: 'I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, \"Can I?\" I don't have to think about that anymore.'\n\nIn November of 2022, an insider told People that the A-list actress remained 'at peace' and 'very happy in her life,' adding, 'She's in a great place, and she knows that ... kids or no kids, it didn't change her.' Aniston in July of 2016 penned a piece for Huffington Post in which she stated her views on the years of speculation over her having kids, and how she felt validated regardless of if she's a parent or not. 'Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child,' Aniston said. 'We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone.' She added: 'Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples ... we don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own \"happily ever after\" for ourselves.' The 2021 clip of Vance has spread online, with former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sharing it in a Tuesday post on X and adding sarcastically 'what a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn\u00b4t hate women having freedoms.'\n\nThe recirculated comment may be a sign of the GOP ticket\u00b4s troubles appealing to women voters, and on the issue of reproductive rights. It follows the explosive entrance in the race of Harris, who secured the support of enough delegates to become the official nominee in less than 32 hours after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid. It also lays out some of the fears expressed by strategists that Trump took a political risk in picking a running mate who has been in Congress less than two years and is largely untested on a bigger stage. Trump liked Vance\u00b4s telegenic qualities and said he reminded him of 'a young Abraham Lincoln.' The Harris campaign contested Vance\u00b4s stance, saying 'every single American has a stake in this country\u00b4s future.' 'Ugly, personal attacks from J.D. Vance and Donald Trump are in line with their dangerous Project 2025 agenda to ban abortion, decimate our democracy, and gut Social Security,' said James Singer, a Harris campaign spokesman, referring to a policy and personnel plan for a second Trump term that was crafted by a host of former administration officials.\n\nTrump has been trying to distance himself from it. Project 2025 says the Department of Health and Human Services should 'pursue a robust agenda' to protect 'the fundamental right to life.' However, the document contains no proposals to cut Social Security, though the Heritage Foundation that oversaw it has long pushed for changes to the entitlement. The plan outlines a dramatic expansion of presidential power and a plan to fire as many as 50,000 government workers. Vance\u00b4s spokesperson said the Harris campaign is lying about Vance's views, noting her record is 'littered with countless failures and disasters. 'It's well known that Senator Vance found success in life due in large part to the influence of strong female role models like his grandmother,' spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said.\n\nVance is a former Marine and businessman who was first elected to public office in 2022. He wrote the 2016 bestseller Hillbilly Elegy, and developed a strong rapport with Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and leading MAGA figures with his personal story of growing up in Appalachia in poverty with a mother battling drug addiction could resonate with voters. One of the major questions Vance is facing is on his abortion stance. Vance previously said he would support a federal bill to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but believes in certain exceptions.\n\nIn 2021, Vance floated an idea to allow parents to cast ballots on behalf of their children, saying during a speech at the conservative nonprofit Intercollegiate Studies Institute in Virginia that people who don't have children 'don\u00b4t have as much of an investment in the future of the country.' 'When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an availability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don\u00b4t have kids,' he said. 'Doesn\u00b4t this mean that non parents don\u00b4t have as much of a voice as parents?' he said critics would then ask. 'Doesn\u00b4t this mean that parents get a bigger say in how a democracy functions? Yes, absolutely.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Vance's 'Childless Cat Ladies' Comment", "body": "Celebrities, Taylor Swift fans, and politicians have slammed Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance for comments he made in a 2021 interview that have recently resurfaced, when he said that the country is being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies.\"\n\nThe controversy stems from a 2021 Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson, while Vance was running for the Ohio senate seat he later won. \"We're effectively run in this country -- via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs -- by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance, who has a wife and three children, told Carlson. \"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nIn the interview, Vance named Vice President Kamala Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as examples of \"people without children\" in the Democratic Party. Harris, who is now the likely Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, has two stepchildren with her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. Buttigieg and his husband Chasten adopted twins soon after Vance's interview aired in 2021.\n\nAs the interview clip resurfaced this week, many people shared their outrage over Vance's comments. Actress Jennifer Aniston responded to the remarks on her Instagram story on Wednesday, writing, \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\"\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,\" the actress continued.\n\nAniston has been vocal in the past about her fertility struggles and her experience with in vitro fertilization (IVF). IVF has become the latest frontier in the fight over reproductive rights, after an Alabama state supreme court ruling classified frozen embryos as children -- a decision that infertility specialists and legal experts worried could have serious ramifications for the widely-used fertility treatment method. Vance has previously voted against protections for fertility treatments like IVF.\n\nVance hasn't commented on the controversy stemming from his 2021 remarks and his campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead More: Why Trump Chose J.D. Vance\n\nWhile Swift herself hasn't publicly addressed Vance's comments, her fans -- known as \"Swifties\" -- took to social media to condemn them. Swift, who isn't married and doesn't have children, has three cats -- one of which she brought to the photoshoot for the cover of TIME when she was named the 2023 Person of the Year.\n\nSeveral Swifties posted the TIME cover on TikTok in response to Vance's remarks. One user posted the cover with Swift's song, Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?, playing in the background, writing, \"What was it that JD Vance said about childless women with cats?\"\n\n\"When it hits you that Taylor Swift is childless and has cats...\" one person posted on X. \"JD Vance really effed this one up. The armageddon is coming for him.\"\n\n\"Hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate,\" another person posted on X.\n\nFeminist writer Caitlin Moran joined the Swifties, saying in a post on X: \"It's bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on 'childless cat ladies' when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is TAYLOR SWIFT.\"\n\nHarris' family also jumped to the Vice President's defense. Kerstin Emhoff, the ex-wife of Doug Emhoff, called criticisms about Harris' lack of biological children \"baseless attacks.\"\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" Emhoff said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nHarris's stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, 25, praised her mother's statement on her Instagram story on Thursday, saying, \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I.\"\n\n\"I love my three parents,\" she added.\n\nVice President Harris hasn't commented on Vance's remarks, and her campaign declined to comment.\n\nButtigieg addressed the issue in a CNN interview on Tuesday, saying that the comments came after he and his husband had been through \"a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.\"\n\n\"[Vance] couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg said. \"It's not about his kids, or my kids, or the Vice President's family. It's about your family. People's families whose well-being will depend on whether we go into a future led by somebody like Kamala Harris who is focused on expanding the prosperity, the freedom, the well-being of our families.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chantelle_lee@time.com", "name": "Chantelle Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

In the wake of the Supreme Count overturning Roe v. Wade two years ago, this block came about as reproductive rights have become a hot button political issue throughout the nation. Kamala Harris, who now stands as the likely Democratic pick for the 2024 election, even directly criticized Vance on his IVF stance shortly after Trump announced his VP pick.\n\n\"Understand, this is a fellow who -- in the United States Senate -- participated in blocking protections for IVF, this is an individual who has made every indication that he is for a national abortion ban,\" Harris said during a campaign stop on July 17.\n\nAniston has been outspoken about her struggles with in vitro fertilization. In 2022, the A-lister opened up to Allure about her reproductive journey. The treatments ultimately didn't take. \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today.

And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAniston shared a screenshot of the clip to her Instagram Story on Wednesday, writing, \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\"\n\nShe also blasted Vance's extreme political stance on reproductive rights. \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston wrote. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nAs a senator Vance voted against the Right to IVF Act, which seeks to protect access to IVF services nationwide. In November 2022, Aniston shared her own fertility journey in an Allure cover story, revealing that she did IVF in her 30s and 40s without success -- all while tabloids were breathlessly tracking her pregnancy status. \"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" Aniston said. \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.\" In the end, Aniston said, she made peace with her inability to conceive: \"The ship has sailed.\"\n\nIn the Allure interview, Aniston also railed against the societal pressure on women to procreate. \"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she said.\n\nSince the clip resurfaced, Vance has faced a barrage of criticism from commentators who have taken issue with the premise of his remarks and noted that Harris actually is a parent (she is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children). Buttigieg has also responded publicly to Vance's attack. \"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" the Transportation Secretary told CNN Tuesday. Buttigieg and his husband adopted newborn twins in September of 2021. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66a24ae41099e2cd4bf5e2bd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1933853774?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Vance's 'Childless Cat Ladies' Quote Has Us Applauding", "body": "What's Cyberchondria? Hailey Bieber Spotlights the Common Condition You've Probably Experienced Too\n\nJennifer Aniston has had it with vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance's views on IVF and \"childless\" people, and she's not the only one.\n\nThe Friends alum took to her Instagram Stories on July 24 to share a clip from a 2021 interview in which Vance, then a US Senate candidate, goes on a rant about \"childless cat ladies\" and how leaders without children -- specifically calling out Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- care less about the country.\n\n\"We're effectively run, in this country... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance says in the Fox News clip. \"It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAniston put Donald Trump's pick for Vice President on blast, writing, \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" she wrote in an Instagram Story. \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her too.\"\n\nAnd she's right. Vance voted against a bill that would protect the right to IVF, which was debated in Congress last month following the Alabama court case that put the common fertility treatment under threat. Vance has also voiced support for a national abortion ban, saying in a 2022 debate, \"My view on this is, generally speaking, Ohio's gonna wanna have different abortion laws than California, than Texas, and I think Ohio should have that right. But some minimum national standard is totally fine with me.\" (Note: a \"minimum national standard\" would by definition be a national ban.)\n\nFor Aniston, the IVF question hits home. Speaking to Allure in 2022, the actress said enduring \"all the years and years and years of [pregnancy] speculation... was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would have given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it.\" She also spoke on those rumors in a 2016 essay for the Huffington Post, writing, \"We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child... We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.\"\n\nCan you hear us applauding? The assertion that you have to have biological children to have a \"direct stake\" in your country is absurd. And as a reminder, Harris is a step-mom to two and Buttigieg and his husband Chasten adopted two children in 2021. (In an interview on CNN, Buttigieg noted that \"the really sad thing is, [Vance] said that after Chasten and I had been through fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey. He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\")\n\nFor her part, Aniston doesn't comment on politics often, though she has become more outspoken in recent years -- especially when it comes to reproductive rights. In 2020, she posted a photo on Instagram showing her slipping her ballot into a drop-off box, writing that she voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. \"I voted for them because right now this country is more divided than ever,\" the Friends alum wrote in the lengthy caption. \"Right now, a few men in power are deciding what women can and can't do with their own bodies. Our current President has decided that racism is a non-issue. He has repeatedly and publicly ignored science... too many people have died.\"\n\nNow, in 2024, Aniston appears to feel the same way. Beyond her comments on Vance, the actress also shared a reel on her Instagram story showing Harris questioning now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his confirmation hearings, a clip originally posted by actress Allison Janney. \"Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\" asks the former prosecutor, as Kavanaugh struggles to answer.\n\nAniston also went on to share a blunt and powerful cartoon from the New Yorker, in which an annoyed child yells at their parents, \"So I can't tell a lie but the Supreme Court gets to do whatever the fuck it wants?\" -- a possible allusion to the Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nOne thing is clear: Aniston's coming out swinging this election season, and we're applauding her empowering takes on reproductive rights.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_ryan@sheknows.com", "name": "Maggie Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

In the interview, the Republican from Ohio, 39, said the U.S. was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nLast month, Vance voted to block Democrat-proposed legislation to guarantee access to IVF nationwide.\n\nVance and his wife Usha are parents to three children, sons Ewan, 6, and Vivek, 4, and daughter Mirabel, 2.\n\nAniston, who has touched on her IVF struggles, told Allure in November 2022 it was \"really hard\" to see the pregnancy rumors that plagued her throughout her career.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard,\" she said. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would have given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it.\"\n\nIn 2016, false pregnancy reports inspired Aniston to write an essay for the Huffington Post about how \"fed up\" she was with them and what they say about those who spread them.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies.

Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option.

However, old comments about her resurfaced, with Friends icon Jennifer admitting she couldn't 'believe' Vance would say something like that.\n\nIn 2021, he described childless women like Harris as 'miserable cat ladies'. Responding to his comments, Jennifer took to her Instagram page to slam him and wrote: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States. All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,' she continued, referencing her own struggles with IVF.\n\n\"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" She wrote the caption over a video of Vance's July 2021 interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The shocking interview saw the Republican hit out at the Democrats, claiming the leadership was dominated by a 'bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made'.\n\nHe also said that 'they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too'. He named the likes of VP Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pete Buttigieg.\n\nVance added: \"It's just a basic fact- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC - the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nActress Jennifer previously discussed her struggles trying to get pregnant and her unsuccessful rounds of IVF. She said to Allure in 2022: \"My late 30s, 40s, I'd gone through really hard s**t, and if it wasn't for going through that, I would've never become who I was meant to be. I was trying to get pregnant.\"\n\nShe added: \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nJennifer met Brad Putt in 1998 before marrying him in 2000. However, their relationship came to a swift end when Brad fell in love with Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith. By January 2005, Brad and Jen announced their split. It didn't take long before the Meet Joe Black actor was seen on multiple outings with Angelina.\n\nIn an unearthed interview with Vanity Fair from September that year, Jen, then 36, expressed her shock and upset over rumours that Angelina was already pregnant - just two months before her divorce was even finalised.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zara_woodcock@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zara Woodcock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishstar.com/incoming/article33322785.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_jen-an.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-01-", "textStart": 2622, "textEnd": 2634}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Vance made during a news interview a few years ago when he was running for a seat in the Senate.\n\nAniston shared a post on Instagram that includes video of the segment, showing Vance talking to then-FOX News host Tucker Carlson. In the video, Vance said women who haven't given birth are \"childless cat ladies\" and don't have \"a direct stake\" in the U.S.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" Aniston wrote in an Instagram story Wednesday. \"All I can say is...Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nAniston, 55, has been vocal about her fertility struggles. In 2022, she told Allure she faced several challenges while trying to conceive, including \"intense media scrutiny\" and unsuccessful in vitro fertilization, or IVF.\n\n\"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it,\" she told the media outlet. \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nThe video of Vance resurfaced on social media after former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term, announced Vance would be his running mate. President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, with Vice President Kamala Harris pursuing the Democratic party's nomination.\n\n\"It doesn't make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it,\" Vance previously told Carlson. \"We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childish cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it's just a basic fact. If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without have children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAniston then shared a clip of Harris at the 2018 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Harris asks Kavanaugh if he can \"think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\"\n\nKavanaugh responds, \"I am not thinking of any right now.\"\n\nNext, Aniston posted a cartoon from The New Yorker that shows a child upset with his mother.\n\n\"So, I can't tell a lie but the Supreme Court gets to do whatever the f*** it wants?\" the child says to his mom.\n\n***WARNING: The following image contains graphic content. Viewer discretion is advised.***\n\nAniston rose to fame for her role as Rachel Green on NBC's hit sitcom \"Friends,\" which aired from 1994 to 2004. She earned multiple awards for the role, including an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a Screen Actors Guild award.\n\nShe has also starred in movies such as \"Office Space,\" \"Rock Star,\" and \"Marley & Me,\" just to name a few. More recently, she has starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in the Apple TV+ series \"The Morning Show.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgxa.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGXA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_a_botelho@wgxa.tv", "name": "Jessica A.

Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\" She added that she hopes Vance's daughter \"will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" Harris called attention to a similar point last week, when she described Vance as \"an individual who has made every indication that he is for a national abortion ban\" and \"participated in blocking protections for IVF\" during a speech in Michigan. Aniston, who doesn't have children, has talked about undergoing IVF and previously said that women \"are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child.\" Online, child-free women have rallied behind Harris and backed up Aniston. Some reminded Vance that a certain influential blonde pop star with no children and three cats has yet to endorse a candidate.\n\nWhile some Republicans have taken issue with the fact that Harris hasn't given birth to children, it's not accurate that she's childless: the vice-president is the stepmother of Doug Emhoff's two children, Ella and Cole. Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, also chimed in, telling the New York Times on Wednesday that the criticisms of Harris not having her own children \"are baseless attacks.\" She added: \"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present.

You look at [Vice President] Kamala Harris, [U.S. Transportation Secretary] Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance, a father of three, said in the clip. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it.\"\n\nVance's remarks to Carlson have resurfaced and gone viral in the wake of former President Donald Trump choosing Vance as his 2024 vice presidential running mate, and Harris becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nOn Instagram, Aniston, who does not have any biological children, issued a strong rebuke, writing above a social media post showing Vance's remarks, \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.\"\n\n\"All I can say is ...,\" she continued. \"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her too.\"\n\nABC News has reached out to Vance for comment.\n\nAniston has spoken publicly about the struggles she faced while trying to get pregnant in her late 30s and early 40s, telling Allure magazine in 2022 that she went through in-vitro fertilization and was \"throwing everything\" at trying to become pregnant.\n\n\"It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" said \"The Morning Show\" actress. \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.\"\n\nDespite the difficulties she faced, Aniston said she has \"zero regrets\" about how her journey turned out.\n\n\"I have zero regrets,\" she told Allure. \"I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.' I don't have to think about that anymore.\"\n\nIn the interview, Aniston also responded to what she described as the \"narrative\" that she was \"selfish\" or just cared about her career when it came to not having kids, saying, \"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child.\"\n\nVance's resurfaced remarks have angered some women, like Aniston, who do not have kids of their own, as well as people who are stepparents or who have become parents through nontraditional means, including adoption.\n\nHarris is a stepmom to two children, Cole Emhoff and Ella Emhoff, through her marriage to Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\nIn the wake of the resurfaced clip of Vance, Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, the biological mother of his two children, defended Harris against what she described as \"baseless attacks.\"\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" Kerstin Emhoff said Thursday in a statement. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nElla Emhoff posted on her story on Instagram, \"I love my three parents,\" while highlighting her mom's statement.

Throughout her career, she has been subjected to excessive tabloid coverage, which has repeatedly prodded into her relationships over the years and questioned why she does not have children.\n\nIn her Allure interview, Aniston said the media's narrative that she \"was just selfish\" and \"just cared about my career\" was painful.\n\n\"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she said in 2022. \"And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Aniston also appeared to give her endorsement to Harris by reposting a 2018 video of Harris pushing then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on abortion rights.\n\n(The video Aniston reposted was shared by actress Allison Janney.)\n\nReproductive health will be a key issue this election. Many women in Hollywood have spoken out about reproductive rights and will align with Harris, who has been the Biden administration's leading voice on abortion and female healthcare.\n\nCNN has reached out to Aniston's representative for further comment on her post about Vance and her apparent endorsement of Harris.", "source": {"uri": "abc7ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_Janney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allison Janney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15094600_jennifer-anniston-ap.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

In a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson, Vance claimed, \"We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it's just a basic fact if you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC...\"\n\nHe further continued, \"The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it. If we want a healthy ruling class in this country, we should invest more, we should vote more, we should support more people who actually have kids. Because those are the people who ultimately have a more direct stake in the future of this country.\"\n\nThe comments have ignited outrage across social media, with many calling out Vance's misogynistic undertone. One user wrote, \"Generalizing a person shows weaknesses of leadership and that's MAGA as a whole.\" In agreement, someone else remarked, \"JD Vance called Kamala Harris a \"childless cat lady\" despite her being married with two stepchildren because he's a misogynistic garbage fire. Women only have value to the GOP as broodmares.\" Someone else chimed in, \"Cats are great judges of character - that's why JD is frightened by them.\"\n\nOne user echoed a similar sentiment and wrote, \"This should be career-ending. JD Vance has contempt for the millions of Americans who don't have children -- by choice or because they can't. I'm old enough to remember when the media went nuts because Hillary Clinton rightfully called Trumpers \"deplorable.\" Where's the outrage?\" Someone else slammed Vance and wrote, \"Her stepkids call her \"Momala\" btw & she writes about the \"endless love and joy\" they bring her. But I guess if you're a step kid or a step-parent your relationship doesn't count and you're not \"real\" to JD Vance.\" One user quipped, \"Oh man, being a childless cat lady is great, I love it! He is just jealous of us.\"\n\nAs per The Independent, President Joe Biden had just announced his decision not to seek re-election, endorsing Harris as his successor. Harris, who has already faced a barrage of sexist and racist attacks from Republicans, responded to Biden's endorsement by reaffirming her commitment to running for the Democratic nomination. Talking about her personal life, in 2019, she wrote, \"I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in. A few years later when Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom.'\"\n\nShe added, \"Instead they came up with the name 'Momala,' Our time as a family is Sunday dinner. We come together, all of us around the table, and over time we've fallen into our roles. Cole sets the table and picks the music, Ella makes beautiful desserts, Doug acts as my sous-chef, and I cook.\"\n\nAs per Today, when criticized, Vance doubled down, asserting, \"I mean, these people recognize that they're unhappy. They're living in one-bedroom apartments in New York City. They've played their entire lives to win a status game. They're obsessed with their jobs...(they) hate normal Americans for choosing family.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/707016/uploads/6f3d30b0-49c9-11ef-9fd6-43529646ec54_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road.\"\n\nShe added that while the world was speculating, she was trying every means possible to conceive a child.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it,\" she shared. \"I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nSince moving on from trying to have a biological child of her own, Aniston said it's a relief.\n\n\"I have zero regrets,\" she shared. \"I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I?

All I can say is ... Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day\".\n\nAniston was responding to recently resurfaced 2021 comments by Vance, who told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the US was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAniston has been increasingly vocal about her own struggles with fertility, including failed attempts at aided conception.\n\nAniston added to her post that she hoped Vance's own daughter \"will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nVance, who has three children has been vocal about his opposition to abortion and even fertility treatment.\n\nSpeaking last week at a campaign speech in Michigan, Harris drew attention to the stances adopted on women's rights by Trump's new running-mate.\n\n\"Understand, this is a fellow who - in the United States Senate - participated in blocking protections for IVF,\" she said. \"This is an individual who has made every indication that he is for a national abortion ban.\"\n\nIn 2016, Aniston wrote an essay for the then Huffington Post about enduring many years of tabloid gossip and speculation over whether she wanted or could have children.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child,\" she wrote. \"We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone.\n\n\"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves.\"\n\nIn 2022, she told Allure such fixation had been made more difficult to handle as she had undergone IVF, without success.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation ... It was really hard,\" she said. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.\"\n\nShe added: \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nKamala Harris is stepmother to husband Doug Emhoff's son Cole, 29, and daughter Ella, 25.\n\nOn Wednesday, their mother, Kerstin Emhoff, joined those expressing outrage over Vance's comments.\n\n\"These are baseless attacks,\" she said. \"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Buttigieg also has children with his husband, Chasten. Responding to Vance's comments, he said that they had been made after \"a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey. He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"\n\nMajor US celebrities have already exerted considerable leverage in this year's election,

Vance, the running mate of her stepmom's rival Donald Trump, calling Harris a 'childless cat lady', she said it was 'upsetting'.\n\nShe defended her 'Momala' on Instagram with the post: 'How can you be \"childless\" when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I' along with the thinking emoji.\n\n'I love my three parents,' Emhoff wrote.\n\nHer post came in response to a resurfaced clip of Vance from 2021 criticizing Harris during a Fox News interview which has now gone viral.\n\nIn the clip, Vance told former host Tucker Carlson the U.S. was being run by 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.'\n\nVance, 39, specifically named Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is also from the Big Apple.\n\n'The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,' Vance said. 'How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?'\n\nThe video started being recirculated as Vance was named Trump's pick for vice president and Harris secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee with Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday.\n\nWhile Harris has not given birth to children, she helped raise her two stepkids, Ella and Cole, 30, who are the children of her husband Doug Emhoff and his ex-wife Kerstin. Harris married Doug in 2014.\n\nDoug Emhoff's ex, Kerstin, also came to Harris' defense with her own scathing response to the criticism.\n\n'These are baseless attacks,' she said in a statement. 'For over ten years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective and always present.'\n\n'I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it,' she continued.\n\nKerstin Emhoff has also posted numerous times in support of Harris' candidacy for president.\n\nThe video of Vance has also received backlash from others including actress Jennifer Aniston.\n\nAniston, 55, took to Instagram Stories on Wednesday with harsh words for Vance.\n\n'I truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,' the Friends star wrote. 'All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.'\n\n'I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option.

I love my three parents.\"\n\nDoug Emhoff's ex-wife Kerstin Emhoff told NBC News: \"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I.\n\n\"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present.

I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas -- you name it. I was throwing everything at it,\" Aniston told Allure.\n\n\"I would have given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today.

JD Vance smeared Vice President Kamala Harris as a \"childless cat lady,\" has resurfaced since he became the Republican vice presidential nominee, sparking widespread anger.\n\nIn the clip, Vance questioned Democrats -- including Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- for not having biological children.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance said.\n\n\"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" he asked.\n\nThe 2021 interview began circulating widely after Hillary Clinton shared the clip on X. \"What a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms,\" she wrote.\n\nVance did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nThough Harris does not have biological children, she does have two stepchildren -- Cole and Ella Emhoff -- who have lovingly referred to her as \"Momala.\"\n\nKerstin Emhoff -- second gentleman Doug Emhoff's ex-wife, and mother to Cole and Ella Emhoff -- has been a vocal supporter of Harris, and defended her against attacks about her parental status.\n\n\"These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" she said. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nElla Emhoff shared her mother's statement on Instagram, writing, \"I love my three parents.\"\n\n\"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?\" she added.\n\nButtigieg also hit back against Vance's comments, saying in a CNN interview that Vance should not speak about other people's children.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg said. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children, and it's not about his kids or my kids or the vice president's family. It's about your family, people's families whose well-being will depend on whether we go into a future led by somebody like Kamala Harris, who is focused on expanding the prosperity, the freedom, the well-being of our families.\n\nActress Jennifer Aniston, who has spoken about her struggles with fertility, made a post on Instagram slamming Vance, who has voted against establishing federal protections for in vitro fertilization.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" Aniston wrote. \"All I can say is ... Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her too.\"\n\nVance's comments have even struck a nerve with some prominent conservative women.\n\n\"One of my best friends did rounds and rounds of unsuccessful IVF wanting to have a child. It is still painful to talk about,\" Meghan McCain said in an X post. \"This 'childless women' comment by JD Vance has made so many waves with so many different friends of mine for its insensitivity and cruelty to women.\"\n\nBeverly Hallberg, a fellow with the conservative nonprofit Independent Women's Forum, replied to McCain's post.\n\n\"I'm childless on earth, but I have a baby in heaven due to an ectopic pregnancy,\" Hallberg said. \"Not all women who don't have children are childless by choice. It adds insult to injury, to put it mildly, when these comments are said.\"\n\nCorie Whalen, media relations director at a Republican think tank and former congressional staffer, said on X she was disgusted by Vance's comments.\n\n\"I'm a right-leaning woman who agrees with almost nothing the Biden-Harris administration has done, but the primal hatred and disgust Vance stokes in me transcends politics,\" she wrote. \"I suspect I am not the only woman of my vintage, so to speak, who feels this way.\"\n\nThe head of a major infertility nonprofit also spoke out against Vance, calling his comments \"painful and tone-deaf.\"\n\n\"People are childfree for many reasons -- from grieving the pain of miscarriage to experiencing failed adoptions or rounds of fertility treatments to making their own choice not to have children,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.\n\n\"For some, living without children doesn't feel like a choice that they made, but a choice that they live with, despite trying to grow their families,\" Collura added. \"Under no circumstances, should living childfree be weaponized in a way that degrades people or their value to society.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News at the American Teachers Federation Conference in Houston, Briget Rein -- a former Brooklyn teacher, who wore a pink shirt that said \"Cats Against Trump\" -- proudly identified herself as a \"cat lady\" and said she thought Vance's remarks were \"stupid.\"\n\n\"Vance also is unprepared to be a vice president, he's not prepared. Because he's busy looking at the surface. He's not looking at the full picture,\" she said.\"You know, this cat lady went to college.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, speaks at a campaign rally at Radford University on Monday in Radford, Va. Julia Nikhinson/Associated Press\n\nThree years ago, well before JD Vance was selected as Donald Trump's running mate, he suggested in a TV interview that some Democrats including Vice President Harris are \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable.\"\n\nThose 2021 comments are resurfacing on social media now that Harris is the likely Democratic nominee, sparking a fresh wave of anger from women who say it's offensive to those struggling with fertility issues - and inaccurate that people without children \"don't really have a direct stake\" in the country's future.\n\nAt the same time, many on social media are embracing and owning the \"childless cat lady\" label as a point of pride, with many even pointing to reported billionaire Taylor Swift as a prime example of a highly successful one - seen even on her 2023 Time \"Person of the Year\" cover with her fluffy rag doll wrapped around her neck.\n\n\"There's a movement,\" declared Nikki Barnes, a previous member of the Democratic National Committee from Florida, accompanied by a \"Childless cat ladies for Harris 2024\" image quickly amassing nearly 2 million views. On TikTok, people are snapping up \"Cat ladies for Harris 2024\" stickers.\n\nThe vociferous response to the resurfaced Vance comments - which have been shared widely and amassed nearly 28 million views on an X post shared Monday - only underscores how female reproductive rights including access to abortion, birth control and in vitro fertilization will be major drivers in the 2024 race. Gender and racial attacks like the ones she experienced as a primary candidate in the 2020 race are poised to accelerate now that she's the likely nominee.\n\nFor the record, Harris, 59, became a stepmom of two when she married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 and has been deeply involved in the lives of stepchildren Ella and Cole. And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom Vance also named in his comments describing how \"the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" became a parent of adopted twins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris spokesman Ammar Moussa said that \"unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance, Vice President Harris understands that every single American has a stake in this country's future.\"\n\nBIOLOGICAL CHILDREN AREN'T ALWAYS AN OPTION\n\nVance's campaign is pointing to a different speech from July 2021 in which he targeted the \"childless left\" but added a caveat: that \"there are people, of course, for biological reasons, medical reasons that can't have children. The target of these remarks is not them.\"\n\nYet many women remind Vance that there are plenty of reasons why they may not have children.\n\nJennifer Aniston arrives at a screening of \"The Morning Show\" during PaleyFest on April 12, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Richard Shotwell/Invision via Associated Press file\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" actress Jennifer Aniston wrote Wednesday, slamming Vance in an Instagram story. \"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" wrote the \"Friends\" star.\n\n\"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" (While Trump has declared support for in vitro fertilization, Senate Republicans last month blocked consideration of a bill to protect IVF access - and the issue erupted in February when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people and that a person could be liable for destroying them.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReproductive health issues, especially conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis can impact women's ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy. Female fertility declines with age and lack of adequate health-care services or child support services can also be factors influencing the decision to have a child.\n\nAniston has previously been candid about the challenges of trying to get pregnant - and has previously written about how \"we don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.\"\n\n'The View\" host Whoopi Goldberg also weighed in on the show Wednesday: \"Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you. You never had a baby; your wife had a baby ... you know nothing about this.\"\n\nMeghan McCain, talk show host and daughter of the late GOP senator John McCain of Arizona, posted on X that \"I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know - these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump-supporting friends.\" The remarks \"have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are,\" she said.\n\nButtigieg in a CNN interview, said Vance's remarks came on the heels of their difficult journey to adoption. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n'CHILDLESS CAT LADIES' EMBRACING SOCIAL MEDIA LABEL\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVance, in his 2021 comments, called out \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" Women online blasted the assumption that those who are without children are unhappy.\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea I was miserable,\" actor Liz Vassey, known for her role on \"CSI,\" wrote on X. \"Thank God there was a man around to tell me.\"\n\nVance's comments came as more Americans are choosing not to have children. A Pew Research Survey in 2021 found that the number of childless U.S. adults aged 18 to 49 who said they were unlikely to ever have children rose by 7 percentage points in the previous three years to 44%. About 56% said they did not want children, 19% stated a medical reason for not having kids, and financial reasons stopped another 17% from becoming a parent.\n\nAs some on social media put it: Childless cat ladies vote, too - and some, even, are cultural icons. \"It's bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on 'childless cat ladies' when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is TAYLOR SWIFT,\" author Caitlin Moran posted. Swift, 34, has three cats and has described them as some of her biggest influences.\n\nSure enough, Swifties were entering the chat in droves. One TikToker added Swift's Time cover to the soundtrack of \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\"\n\nAnother posted a video of Swift riding a giant rendering of her cat Olivia dressed as a unicorn, with the text: \"Childless cat ladies riding to polls in November to vote for Harris.\"\n\nLegal fellow and Lawfare correspondent Anna Bower pointed out on X: \"hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines JD Vance leads Trump's push to win key 'blue wall' states\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nMainers are filling in as extras in the opera 'Aida.'

JD Vance smeared Vice President Kamala Harris as one of a group of \"childless cat ladies,\" has resurfaced since he became the Republican vice presidential nominee, sparking widespread anger.\n\nIn the clip, Vance questioned Democrats -- including Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- for not having biological children.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance said.\n\nMORE: Kamala Harris is a stepmom of 2: What to know about her family\n\n\"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" he asked.\n\nThe 2021 interview began circulating widely after Hillary Clinton shared the clip on X. \"What a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms,\" she wrote.\n\nVance did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nThough Harris does not have biological children, she does have two stepchildren -- Cole and Ella Emhoff -- who have lovingly referred to her as \"Momala.\"\n\nKerstin Emhoff -- second gentleman Doug Emhoff's ex-wife, and mother to Cole and Ella Emhoff -- has been a vocal supporter of Harris, and defended her against attacks about her parental status.\n\n\"These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" she said. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nElla Emhoff shared her mother's statement on Instagram, writing, \"I love my three parents.\"\n\nMORE: Vance years ago expressed support for Iraq War, despite current criticism\n\n\"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?\" she added.\n\nButtigieg also hit back against Vance's comments, saying in a CNN interview that Vance should not speak about other people's children.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg said. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children, and it's not about his kids or my kids or the vice president's family. It's about your family, people's families whose well-being will depend on whether we go into a future led by somebody like Kamala Harris, who is focused on expanding the prosperity, the freedom, the well-being of our families.\n\nActress Jennifer Aniston, who has spoken about her struggles with fertility, made a post on Instagram slamming Vance, who has voted against establishing federal protections for in vitro fertilization.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" Aniston wrote. \"All I can say is ... Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her too.\"\n\nVance's comments have even struck a nerve with some prominent conservative women.\n\n\"One of my best friends did rounds and rounds of unsuccessful IVF wanting to have a child. It is still painful to talk about,\" Meghan McCain said in an X post. \"This 'childless women' comment by JD Vance has made so many waves with so many different friends of mine for its insensitivity and cruelty to women.\"\n\nBeverly Hallberg, a fellow with the conservative nonprofit Independent Women's Forum, replied to McCain's post.\n\n\"I'm childless on earth, but I have a baby in heaven due to an ectopic pregnancy,\" Hallberg said. \"Not all women who don't have children are childless by choice. It adds insult to injury, to put it mildly, when these comments are said.\"\n\nMORE: 'Kamala IS brat': How Kamala Harris' campaign is embracing the memes\n\nCorie Whalen, media relations director at a Republican think tank and former congressional staffer, said on X she was disgusted by Vance's comments.\n\n\"I'm a right-leaning woman who agrees with almost nothing the Biden-Harris administration has done, but the primal hatred and disgust Vance stokes in me transcends politics,\" she wrote. \"I suspect I am not the only woman of my vintage, so to speak, who feels this way.\"\n\nThe head of a major infertility nonprofit also spoke out against Vance, calling his comments \"painful and tone-deaf.\"\n\n\"People are childfree for many reasons -- from grieving the pain of miscarriage to experiencing failed adoptions or rounds of fertility treatments to making their own choice not to have children,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.\n\n\"For some, living without children doesn't feel like a choice that they made, but a choice that they live with, despite trying to grow their families,\" Collura added. \"Under no circumstances, should living childfree be weaponized in a way that degrades people or their value to society.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News at the American Teachers Federation Conference in Houston, Briget Rein -- a former Brooklyn teacher, who wore a pink shirt that said \"Cats Against Trump\" -- proudly identified herself as a \"cat lady\" and said she thought Vance's remarks were \"stupid.\"\n\n\"Vance also is unprepared to be a vice president, he's not prepared. Because he's busy looking at the surface. He's not looking at the full picture,\" she said.\"You know, this cat lady went to college. This cat lady went to work ... but he's busy talking about cat ladies, and talking about women in a very derogatory fashion.\"\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., argued that even small attacks on Harris -- even if Harris and her campaign embrace the incoming and try to make light of it -- could undermine her, pointing to the 2021 video of the comments from Vance.\n\n\"It's really undermining her, and the fact that we get fixated on it and repeat it, and even though we just do memes and try to make it funny, we're literally talking about that she's a cat owner,\" Gillibrand said Wednesday night after a screening of a documentary on Geraldine Ferraro. \"It's absurd. She's running for president the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Because you are trying to take that away from her too.\"\n\nAniston followed the post with a video of Vice President Kamala Harris asking US Supreme Court associate justice Brett Kavanaugh if he could \"think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\".\n\nAniston, who was previously married to actor Brad Pitt, does not have any children.

Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,\" she wrote. \"Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nVance made the comments during a 2021 interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, when he questioned Vice President Kamala Harris' leadership because she does not have biological children.\n\nVance said in the clip that the country was run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too\".\n\n\"Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance said. \"How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nThe video has gone viral again in the build-up to the presidential election in November, with many women without children branding Vance's comments as sexist, misogynistic and fulfilling a historical stereotype that women who choose not to have children are lonely and unloved.\n\nAmerican actor Liz Vassey, known for her roles on All My Children and on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, sarcastically replied to Vance's comments on social media: \"I had absolutely no idea I was miserable. Thank God there was a man around to tell me.\"\n\nAnother X/Twitter user wrote: \"As a non-birth giver, I've heard judgments about this since my 20s, but this thing about having no stake in society unless you produce young is very sinister to me.\"\n\n\"I choose not to have kids and I've never regretted it. I'm not lacking anything and my life is quite full, thank you very much,\" a third woman wrote.\n\nOther women on social media pointed out that the comments were insensitive towards women who cannot conceive due to health reasons.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Harris, one of the politicians Vance dubbed a \"childless cat lady\", spoke about Vance's stances on IVF and abortion in a campaign speech last week in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n\"Understand, this is a fellow who -- in the United States Senate -- participated in blocking protections for IVF. This is an individual who has made every indication that he is for a national abortion ban,\" said Harris.\n\nIn June, Vance voted to block the Right to IVF Act, which would have protected the accessibility of IVF services nationwide.\n\nAniston, who does not have any children, has been open about her own experience with IVF in the past.\n\nThe We're The Millers actor has long been critical of the stereotype that women who choose not to have children, or cannot have them, have failed in some way.\n\nIn an essay written for Huffington Post in 2016, Aniston wrote that women don't need to be \"married or mothers to be complete\".\n\n\"We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone,\" she wrote in the essay. \"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Children", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All My Children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/25/08/jennifer1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 14, "textEnd": 21}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

On TikTok, people are snapping up \"Cat ladies for Harris 2024\" stickers.\n\nThe vociferous response to the resurfaced Vance comments - which have been shared widely and amassed nearly 28 million views on an X post shared Monday - only underscores how female reproductive rights including access to abortion, birth control and in vitro fertilization will be a major drivers in the 2024 race. Gender and racial attacks like the ones she experienced as a primary candidate in the 2020 race are poised to accelerate now that she's the likely nominee.\n\nFor the record, Harris, 59, became a stepmom of two when she married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 and has been deeply involved in the lives of stepchildren Ella and Cole. And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom Vance also named in his comments describing how \"the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" became a parent of adopted twins.\n\nHarris spokesman Ammar Moussa said that \"unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance, Vice President Harris understands that every single American has a stake in this country's future.\"\n\nVance's campaign is pointing to a different speech from the July 2021 in which he targeted the \"childless left\" but added a caveat: that \"there are people, of course, for biological reasons, medical reasons that can't have children. The target of these remarks is not them.\"\n\nYet many women are reminding Vance that there are plenty of reasons they may not have children.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" actress Jennifer Aniston wrote Wednesday, slamming Vance in an Instagram story. \"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" wrote the \"Friends\" star.\n\n\"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" (While Trump has declared support for in vitro fertilization, Senate Republicans last month blocked consideration of a bill to protect IVF access - and the issue erupted in February when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people and that a person could be liable for destroying them.)\n\nReproductive health issues, especially conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis can impact women's ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy. Female fertility declines with age and lack of adequate health-care services or child support services can also be factors influencing the decision to have a child.\n\nAniston has previously been candid about the challenges of trying to get pregnant - and has previously written about how \"we don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.\"\n\n'The View\" host Whoopi Goldberg also weighed in on the show Wednesday: \"Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you. You never had a baby; your wife had a baby ... you know nothing about this.\"\n\nMeghan McCain, talk show host and daughter of the late GOP senator John McCain of Arizona, posted on X that \"I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know - these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.\" The remarks \"have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are,\" she said.\n\nButtigieg in a CNN interview, said Vance's remarks came on the heels of their difficult journey to adoption. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nVance, in his 2021 comments, called out \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" Women online blasted the assumption that those who are without children are unhappy.\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea I was miserable,\" actor Liz Vassey, known for her role on \"CSI,\" wrote on X. \"Thank God there was a man around to tell me.\"\n\nVance's comments came as more Americans are choosing not to have children. A Pew Research Survey in 2021 found that the childless U.S. adults aged 18 to 49 who said they were unlikely to ever have children rose by 7 percentage points in the previous three years to 44 percent. About 56 percent said they did not want children, 19 percent stated a medical reason for not having kids, and financial reasons stopped another 17 percent from becoming a parent.\n\nAs some on social media put it: Childless cat ladies vote, too - and some, even, are cultural icons. \"It's bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on 'childless cat ladies' when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is TAYLOR SWIFT,\" author Caitlin Moran posted. Swift, 34, has three cats and has described them as some of her biggest influences.\n\nSure enough, Swifties were entering the chat in droves. One TikToker added Swift's Time cover to the soundtrack of \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\"\n\nAnother posted a video of Swift riding a giant rendering of her cat Olivia dressed as a unicorn, with the text: \"Childless cat ladies riding to polls in November to vote for Harris.\"\n\nLegal fellow and Lawfare correspondent Anna Bower pointed out on X: \"hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it.\"\n\nSince Vance's comments resurfaced, conservative women have spoken out against them, suggesting the remarks could damaged Trump's 2024 election hopes, given how important the female vote is to the GOP ticket.\n\nCorie Whalen, a onetime communications director for former Michigan Representative Justin Amash, a Republican, posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"I'm a right-leaning woman who agrees with almost nothing the Biden-Harris administration has done, but the primal hatred and disgust Vance stokes in me transcends politics.\n\n\"I suspect I am not the only woman of my vintage, so to speak, who feels this way.\"\n\nBeverly Hallberg, the president of District Media Group and a Fox News contributor, wrote on X: \"I'm childless on earth, but I have a baby in heaven due to an ectopic pregnancy. Not all women who don't have children are childless by choice. It adds insult to injury, to put it mildly, when these comments are said.\"\n\nIn a follow-up post, Hallberg added: \"Even if a politician is talking only about childless women who choose not to have kids (even tho that wasn't stated), it puts women who desire motherhood in the difficult position of having to explain that they aren't a liberal feminist, even though they are childless.\n\n\"It's not helpful to women, including conservative women like myself, and it's an unforced messaging error by a politician.\"\n\nMeghan McCain, a former host of The View and the daughter of late Arizona Senator John McCain, wrote on X: \"One of my best friends did rounds and rounds of unsuccessful IVF wanting to have a child. It is still painful to talk about.\n\n\"This 'childless women' comment by JD Vance has made so many waves with so many different friends of mine for its insensitivity and cruelty to women.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Vance's office for comment via email.\n\nElsewhere, actress Jennifer Aniston also condemned Vance over his remarks. The Friends star has previously spoken out about trying to have children through in vitro fertilization.\n\n\"All I can say is ... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston wrote on her Instagram stories. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nIn June, Vance voted against the Right to IVF Act, which would have protected accessibility and affordability of IVF services across the U.S.\n\nVance has also expressed support for a national abortion ban, including in the case of rape or incest.\n\n\"It's not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term. It's whether a child should be allowed to live, even though the circumstances of that child's birth are somehow inconvenient or a problem to the society,\" Vance said in 2021. \"The question really, to me, is about the baby.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Vance accused the Democrats of misquoting his views that a pregnancy from rape or incest was \"inconvenient.\"\n\n\"The Democrats have completely twisted my words,\" Vance said. \"What I did say is that we sometimes in this society see babies as inconveniences, and I absolutely want us to

On TikTok, people are snapping up \"Cat ladies for Harris 2024\" stickers.\n\nThe vociferous response to the resurfaced Vance comments - which have been shared widely and amassed nearly 28 million views on an X post shared Monday - only underscores how female reproductive rights including access to abortion, birth control and in vitro fertilization will be a major drivers in the 2024 race. Gender and racial attacks like the ones she experienced as a primary candidate in the 2020 race are poised to accelerate now that she's the likely nominee.\n\nFor the record, Harris, 59, became a stepmom of two when she married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 and has been deeply involved in the lives of stepchildren Ella and Cole. And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom Vance also named in his comments describing how \"the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" became a parent of adopted twins.\n\nHarris spokesman Ammar Moussa said that \"unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance, Vice President Harris understands that every single American has a stake in this country's future.\"\n\nBiological children are not always an option, women remind Vance\n\nVance's campaign is pointing to a different speech from the July 2021 in which he targeted the \"childless left\" but added a caveat: that \"there are people, of course, for biological reasons, medical reasons that can't have children. The target of these remarks is not them.\"\n\nYet many women are reminding Vance that there are plenty of reasons they may not have children.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" actress Jennifer Aniston wrote Wednesday, slamming Vance in an Instagram story. \"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" wrote the \"Friends\" star.\n\n\"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" (While Trump has declared support for in vitro fertilization, Senate Republicans last month blocked consideration of a bill to protect IVF access - and the issue erupted in February when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are people and that a person could be liable for destroying them.)\n\nReproductive health issues, especially conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis can impact women's ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy. Female fertility declines with age and lack of adequate health-care services or child support services can also be factors influencing the decision to have a child.\n\nAniston has previously been candid about the challenges of trying to get pregnant - and has previously written about how \"we don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.\"\n\n'The View\" host Whoopi Goldberg also weighed in on the show Wednesday: \"Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you. You never had a baby; your wife had a baby ... you know nothing about this.\"\n\nMeghan McCain, talk show host and daughter of the late GOP senator John McCain of Arizona, posted on X that \"I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know - these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.\" The remarks \"have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are,\" she said.\n\nButtigieg in a CNN interview, said Vance's remarks came on the heels of their difficult journey to adoption. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n'Childless cat ladies' are embracing the label on social media\n\nVance, in his 2021 comments, called out \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" Women online blasted the assumption that those who are without children are unhappy.\n\n\"I had absolutely no idea I was miserable,\" actor Liz Vassey, known for her role on \"CSI,\" wrote on X. \"Thank God there was a man around to tell me.\"\n\nVance's comments came as more Americans are choosing not to have children. A Pew Research Survey in 2021 found that the childless U.S. adults aged 18 to 49 who said they were unlikely to ever have children rose by 7 percentage points in the previous three years to 44 percent. About 56 percent said they did not want children, 19 percent stated a medical reason for not having kids, and financial reasons stopped another 17 percent from becoming a parent.\n\nAs some on social media put it: Childless cat ladies vote, too - and some, even, are cultural icons. \"It's bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on 'childless cat ladies' when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is TAYLOR SWIFT,\" author Caitlin Moran posted. Swift, 34, has three cats and has described them as some of her biggest influences.\n\nSure enough, Swifties were entering the chat in droves. One TikToker added Swift's Time cover to the soundtrack of \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\"\n\nAnother posted a video of Swift riding a giant rendering of her cat Olivia dressed as a unicorn, with the text: \"Childless cat ladies riding to polls in November to vote for Harris.\"\n\nLegal fellow and Lawfare correspondent Anna Bower pointed out on X: \"hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Vance's recent comments about \"childless\" women, completely slamming Donald Trump's running mate.\n\nJ.D. Vance's comment has received backlash from many, including Jennifer Aniston, who has struggled with fertility.\n\nIn a recently resurfaced video from a 2021 episode of Tucker Carlson's former Fox News show, J.D. Vance, who, at the time, was a candidate for the Ohio Senate, made a striking statement.\n\nVance claimed that the United States was being governed by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable with their own lives and the choices they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nHe also said, \"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAfter seeing the resurfaced clip, Jennifer Aniston took to her Instagram Stories to express her opinions.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" the actress wrote on her Instagram stories. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option.\"\n\n\"Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,\" she added.\n\nThis comes two years after Aniston revealed that she struggled with her fertility and underwent IVF.\n\n\"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" Aniston told Allure, recalling the struggles she faced during her 30s and 40s. \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.\"\n\n\"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it,\" she continued. \"So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\n\"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she also said in 2022. \"And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies.\"\n\nThe comment regarding \"childless\" women is, by far, the only comment that has gotten Vance in some trouble.\n\nAfter Donald Trump named J.D. Vance as his running mate, another clip has resurfaced, this one regarding his comments on \"violent\" marriages.\n\n\"This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is the idea that like, 'Well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy,\" he said, per NewsWeek. \"And so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that's going to make people happier in the long term.'\n\n\"And maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I'm skeptical. But it really didn't work out for the kids of those marriages,\" Vance added.\n\nWhen asked about the comments, Trump's running mate later said, \"I reject the premise of your bogus question. As anyone who studies these issues knows: domestic violence has skyrocketed in recent years and is much higher among non-married couples. \"\n\n\"That's the 'trick' I reference: that domestic violence would somehow go down if progressives got what they want, when in fact modern society's war on families has made our domestic violence situation much worse,\" he said. \"Any fair person would recognize I was criticizing the progressive frame on this issue, not embracing it.\"\n\n\"But I can see that you are not a fair person, so rather than answer your loaded and baseless question, let me offer the following: I'm an actual victim of domestic violence.

Vance made during a news interview a few years ago when he was running for a seat in the Senate.\n\nAniston shared a post on Instagram that includes video of the segment, showing Vance talking to then-FOX News host Tucker Carlson. In the video, Vance said women who haven't given birth are \"childless cat ladies\" and don't have \"a direct stake\" in the U.S.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" Aniston wrote in an Instagram story Wednesday. \"All I can say is...Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nAniston, 55, has been vocal about her fertility struggles. In 2022, she told Allure she faced several challenges while trying to conceive, including \"intense media scrutiny\" and unsuccessful in vitro fertilization, or IVF.\n\n\"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it,\" she told the media outlet. \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nThe video of Vance resurfaced on social media after former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term, announced Vance would be his running mate. President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, with Vice President Kamala Harris pursuing the Democratic party's nomination.\n\nHarris, who is married to Doug Emhoff, is the step-mother to two children.\n\n\"It doesn't make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it,\" Vance previously told Carlson. \"We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childish cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it's just a basic fact. If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without have children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAniston then shared a clip of Harris at the 2018 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Harris asks Kavanaugh if he can \"think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\"\n\nKavanaugh responds, \"I am not thinking of any right now.\"\n\nNext, Aniston posted a cartoon from The New Yorker that shows a child upset with his mother.\n\n\"So, I can't tell a lie but the Supreme Court gets to do whatever the f*** it wants?\" the child says to his mom.\n\nAccording to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, few Americans fully endorse the idea that a fertilized egg should have the same rights as a pregnant woman.\n\nThe new survey comes as questions grow around reproductive health access in the continued fallout from the decision by the Supreme Court to end federal abortion protections. The poll found that a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban as a rising number support access to abortions for any reason.\n\nPro-life advocates are increasingly pushing for broader measures that would give rights and protections to embryos and fetuses, which could have massive implications for fertility treatments and other areas of health care.\n\nAniston rose to fame for her role as Rachel Green on NBC's hit sitcom \"Friends,\" which aired from 1994 to 2004. She earned multiple awards for the role, including an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a Screen Actors Guild award.\n\nShe has also starred in movies such as \"Office Space,\" \"Rock Star,\" and \"Marley & Me,\" just to name a few. More recently, she has starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in the Apple TV+ series \"The Morning Show.\"", "source": {"uri": "turnto10.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WJAR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_a_botelho@turnto10.com", "name": "Jessica A.

Vance over 'cat lady' attack on Kamala Harris", "body": "The Friends star, who has struggled with infertility, took aim at comments by Trump\u2019s running mate on people who don\u2019t have children\n\nJennifer Aniston has entered the 2024 election news cycle to call out former US president Donald Trump\u2019s running mate \u2013 Hillbilly Elegy author and Ohio Senator J.D. Vance \u2013 over his remarks about people who haven\u2019t borne children.\n\nThe Emmy-winning Friends star on Wednesday shared her disbelief over a resurfaced clip of the Republican nominee for US vice-president, who in 2021 likened Democrats like Vice-President Kamala Harris to \u201cchildless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made\u201d.\n\nVance said: \u201cThey want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\u201d\n\nPosting a tweet about the clip on her Instagram story, the actor wrote: \u201cI truly can\u2019t believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Morning Show star, who opened up about her infertility struggles in 2022, then directed her comments to Vance himself while alluding to the Republican Party\u2019s support of personhood laws that would affect access to abortion, in vitro fertilisation procedures and certain types of contraception.\n\nJD Vance says women who haven\u2019t given birth like Kamala Harris are \u201cchildless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives,\u201d and have \u201cno direct stake\u201d in America. pic.twitter.com/3DJY3pQTGe\n\n\u2014 Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) July 22, 2024\n\n\u201cAll I can say is \u2026 Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Aniston did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe senator from Ohio, 39, was a candidate for the US Congress when he made the remarks in 2021 on former Fox News host Tucker Carlson\u2019s show, but the clip has made the rounds on social media recently in the wake of Trump tapping his one-time critic as his running mate at the Republican National Convention last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a basic fact \u2013 you look at Kamala Harris, [Transport Secretary] Pete Buttigieg, AOC [congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] \u2013 the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we\u2019ve turned our country over to people who don\u2019t really have a direct stake in it?\u201d Vance told Carlson.\n\nAfter taking aim at Vance, Aniston, 55, appeared to endorse Harris, who stepped into the race Sunday after US President Joe Biden heeded widespread calls to drop out of the election. She reposted a 2018 video from fellow actor Allison Janney showing the former prosecutor and senator grilling Justice Brett Kavanaugh, then a US Supreme Court nominee, on abortion rights.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Aniston provided rare insight into her attempts at parenthood and how the media scrutinised her about not having children during her high-profile marriages to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux.\n\n\u201cI was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\u201d she told Allure. \u201cAll the years and years and years of speculation \u2026 It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would\u2019ve given anything if someone had said to me, \u2018Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.\u2019 You just don\u2019t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\u201d\n\nAniston said that the media painfully labelled her as \u201cselfish\u201d and someone who \u201cjust cared about her career\u201d.\n\n\u201cGod forbid a woman is successful and doesn\u2019t have a child,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn\u2019t give him a kid. It was absolute lies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Harris\u2019 stepdaughter Ella Emhoff and Ella\u2019s mother, Kerstin Emhoff, came to Harris\u2019 defence.\n\nElla Emhoff posted a statement her mother had given to CNN on her Instagram story on Thursday. In it, Kerstin Emhoff called the \u201cchildless\u201d claims against Harris \u201cbaseless\u201d and praised Harris as a \u201cco-parent\u201d to her two children with second gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\n\u201cShe is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present,\u201d the statement said.\n\nElla Emhoff added: \u201cHow can you be \u2018childless\u2019 when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I. @kemhoff say it louder for the people in the back \u2026 I love my three parents.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The man who is former President Donald Trump running mate for the 2024 election had previously called Kamala Harris a \"miserable cat lady\".\n\nKamala is now set to take on Donald Trump in November's election after Joe Biden withdrew, but that has led to a series of comments aimed at the current VP. One old interview from JD Vance led to an impassioned response from Friends icon Jennifer, reports the Mirror.\n\nIn 2021, Senator Vance claimed that childless women like Kamala Harris were \"miserable cat ladies\". The comments resurfaced this week, prompting Jennifer to hit back, saying: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States. All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\"\n\nREAD MORE: James Bond star George Lazenby issues emotional life update\n\nThe comments have been viewed by many at Jennifer's own struggles with having children and subsequent troubles with IVF. She hit back at Senator Vance, saying: \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nJD Vance's comments came within a wider interview with Fox News where he slammed VP Harris' Democratic party, claiming it was overrun by a \"bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made\". He even claimed that these women \"want to make the rest of the country miserable too\".\n\nJennifer's reaction prompted many online to look back on her documented struggles with becoming a mother. The Friends actor told Allure magazine earlier this year about her conception issues.\n\nShe said: \"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road. My late 30s, 40s, I'd gone through really hard [stuff], and if it wasn't for going through that, I would've never become who I was meant to be.

JD Vance smeared Vice President Kamala Harris as a \"childless cat lady,\" has resurfaced since he became the Republican vice presidential nominee, sparking widespread anger.\n\nIn the clip, Vance questioned Democrats -- including Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- for not having biological children.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance said.\n\n\"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" he asked.\n\nThe 2021 interview began circulating widely after Hillary Clinton shared the clip on X. \"What a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms,\" she wrote.\n\nVance did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nThough Harris does not have biological children, she does have two stepchildren -- Cole and Ella Emhoff -- who have lovingly referred to her as \"Momala.\"\n\nKerstin Emhoff -- second gentleman Doug Emhoff's ex-wife, and mother to Cole and Ella Emhoff -- has been a vocal supporter of Harris, and defended her against attacks about her parental status.\n\n\"These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" she said. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nElla Emhoff shared her mother's statement on Instagram, writing, \"I love my three parents.\"\n\n\"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?\" she added.\n\nButtigieg also hit back against Vance's comments, saying in a CNN interview that Vance should not speak about other people's children.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg said. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children, and it's not about his kids or my kids or the vice president's family. It's about your family, people's families whose well-being will depend on whether we go into a future led by somebody like Kamala Harris, who is focused on expanding the prosperity, the freedom, the well-being of our families.\n\nActress Jennifer Aniston, who has spoken about her struggles with fertility, made a post on Instagram slamming Vance, who has voted against establishing federal protections for in vitro fertilization.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" Aniston wrote. \"All I can say is ... Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her too.\"\n\nVance's comments have even struck a nerve with some prominent conservative women.\n\n\"One of my best friends did rounds and rounds of unsuccessful IVF wanting to have a child. It is still painful to talk about,\" Meghan McCain said in an X post. \"This 'childless women' comment by JD Vance has made so many waves with so many different friends of mine for its insensitivity and cruelty to women.\"\n\nBeverly Hallberg, a fellow with the conservative nonprofit Independent Women's Forum, replied to McCain's post.\n\n\"I'm childless on earth, but I have a baby in heaven due to an ectopic pregnancy,\" Hallberg said. \"Not all women who don't have children are childless by choice. It adds insult to injury, to put it mildly, when these comments are said.\"\n\nCorie Whalen, media relations director at a Republican think tank and former congressional staffer, said on X she was disgusted by Vance's comments.\n\n\"I'm a right-leaning woman who agrees with almost nothing the Biden-Harris administration has done, but the primal hatred and disgust Vance stokes in me transcends politics,\" she wrote. \"I suspect I am not the only woman of my vintage, so to speak, who feels this way.\"\n\nThe head of a major infertility nonprofit also spoke out against Vance, calling his comments \"painful and tone-deaf.\"\n\n\"People are childfree for many reasons -- from grieving the pain of miscarriage to experiencing failed adoptions or rounds of fertility treatments to making their own choice not to have children,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.\n\n\"For some, living without children doesn't feel like a choice that they made, but a choice that they live with, despite trying to grow their families,\" Collura added. \"Under no circumstances, should living childfree be weaponized in a way that degrades people or their value to society.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News at the American Teachers Federation Conference in Houston, Briget Rein -- a former Brooklyn teacher, who wore a pink shirt that said \"Cats Against Trump\" -- proudly identified herself as a \"cat lady\" and said she thought Vance's remarks were \"stupid.\"\n\n\"Vance also is unprepared to be a vice president, he's not prepared. Because he's busy looking at the surface. He's not looking at the full picture,\" she said.\"You know, this cat lady went to college. This cat lady went to work ... but he's busy talking about cat ladies, and talking about women in a very derogatory fashion.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"},

You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\"\n\nHe added, \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nHarris has two stepchildren with her husband, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.

It was really hard,\" she added. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nShe added, \"I just cared about my career. And God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child. And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies. I don't have anything to hide at this point.\"\n\nAniston was married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 and Justin Theroux from 2015 to 2017.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeidasTouch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MeidasTouch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Morning Show (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Theroux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Theroux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Infertility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Infertility", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Oceania", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/25/USAT/74537179007-20240602-t-205414-z-5323656-rc-2738-a-7-wame-rtrmadp-3-televisionthemorningshow.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5499,3093,x0,y366&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Vance's \"Childless Cat Ladies\" Comments", "body": "By now, you've probably heard the comments from former President Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate, J.D. Vance, calling people without children \"childless cat ladies\" being bad for the country.\n\nWell, Jennifer Aniston also heard these resurfaced statements, and she's taking the Ohio senator to task.\n\nThe recently resurfaced comments from Vance, then a senate candidate, were made in 2022 while speaking with then-Fox News talking head, Tucker Carlson. He said:\n\nWe're effectively run in this country via the Democrats ... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It's just a basic fact. You have Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. How does that make any sense when we've turned our country over to people who don't have a direct stake in it.\n\nThe comments have caused uproar in the media, both social and traditional, and Aniston is among the latest to convey her disappointment over such accusations.\n\nOn Instagram Stories, the Morning Show actress shared the clip, writing in text overlay on the clip:\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States. All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nAniston's sentiments on IVF refer to the fact that Vance (along with the majority of Senate Republicans) voted against the Right to IVF Act earlier this summer.\n\nSponsored by Tammy Duckworth (D, IL), Patty Murray (D, WA), and Cory Booker (D, NJ), the bill would establish a nationwide right to assisted reproductive technologies like IVF and ensure more accessibility to these technologies via lower costs.\n\nFor years, Aniston's fertility was the subject of innumerable tabloid rumors -- Was she pregnant? Wasn't she pregnant? Was she trying to get pregnant? Why was she trying to get or not get pregnant?\n\nWhile she would occasionally express her disdain for the press speculation and invasion of her privacy on the matter (as with the 2016 HuffPo op-ed \"For The Record\"), she remained silent on the specific questions surrounding, bluntly, her uterus until 2022.\n\nIn a candid interview with Allure, Aniston revealed that over the years she had, in fact, been trying to get pregnant.\n\n\"It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" she said. \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nAcross media and social media, Aniston's response to Vance's comments are garnering attention of all stripes. Many are supporting her, some are mocking her, and some are enjoying making memes about the Instagram statement.\n\nEven conservative pundit Meghan McCain addressed the exchange, warning fellow Republicans to avoid such inflammatory language as it appeared to be \"activating women across all sides.\"\n\n\"This is not who we are,\" McCain stated.\n\nBut Vance's 2022 comments, do appear to reflect a broader worldview, or at least one he has had as recently as two years ago.\n\nIn 2021, Vance advocated giving parents as many votes as they had children.\n\nIn similar rhetoric that we see in the Carlson clip, Vance elaborated, \"You should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don't have kids. Let's face the consequences and the reality.

JD Vance over his comments in 2021 about childless political figures. The criticism comes as Vance, recently named the former president's running mate, faces renewed scrutiny for his past statements.\n\nIn an Instagram story posted Wednesday, Aniston expressed disbelief that a vice presidential candidate would insult childless women. She shared a clip of Vance's 2021 interview on Tucker Carlson's former Fox News program, where he claimed the United States was being governed by \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Vance suggested that political leaders without children, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, lacked a \"direct stake\" in the country's future. He argued that individuals with children are generally happier, healthier and better equipped to lead the nation.\n\nAniston, who has previously discussed her own fertility challenges, took particular issue with Vance's stance on reproductive rights. She expressed concern for Vance's daughter, hoping she would not face difficulties conceiving in the future while criticizing the senator's efforts to restrict access to fertility treatments like IVF.\n\nThe resurfaced interview has sparked controversy as Vance steps into the national spotlight as a vice presidential pick. It highlights the ongoing debate about work-life balance in politics and the diverse family structures of American leaders.\n\nNotably, some of Vance's claims about childless leaders were inaccurate - Harris has two stepchildren, and Buttigieg has two children as well.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: JD Vance Jennifer Aniston", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uInterview"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_ramsey@uinterview.com", "name": "Lauren Ramsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jennifer-Aniston-attends-the-81st-Annual-Golden-Globe-Awards-c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Vance becoming the next Vice President of the United States.\n\nThe Friends star was particularly disturbed by Vance's resurfaced 2021 comments, where he described childless women like Vice President Kamala Harris as 'miserable cat ladies.'\n\nOn Wednesday, July 24, Aniston, 55, took to Instagram to slam the politician for his comments.\n\nShe wrote: 'I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.'\n\n'All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,' she continued, referencing her own struggles with IVF.\n\n'I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,' Aniston continued, 'because you are trying to take that away from her, too.'\n\nAniston's post featured a screenshot of a tweet that brought Vance's July 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson back into the spotlight.\n\nIn the interview, the Ohio Republican criticized Democratic U.S. leadership, saying it was dominated by 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.'\n\nHe specifically named Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nHe continues in the clip: 'It's just a basic fact- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC - the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?'\n\nHarris is a stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children, Cole, 29, and Ella, 25. Vance and his wife Usha have three children, Ewan, 6, Vivek, 4, and Mirabel, 2.\n\nVance's remarks have become even more contentious in light of recently being named as former President Donald Trump's running mate for the 2024 presidential election, after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election, paving the way for Harris to run for the presidency.\n\nAniston's reaction is almost certainly rooted in her well-known personal experiences with fertility issues.\n\nIn an interview with Allure in November 2022, she discussed the pain caused by years of speculation about her potential pregnancies.\n\n'All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would have given anything if someone had said to me, \"Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.\" You just don't think it.'\n\nAlthough she didn't go into detail about her IVF journey, she revealed, 'Here I am today. The ship has sailed... I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, \"Can I?\" I don't have to think about that anymore.'\n\nIn a 2016 Huffington Post essay, Aniston tackled the false pregnancy reports head-on, criticizing the societal pressures placed on women.\n\nShe wrote: 'Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone.'\n\nThe Morning Show actress continued: 'Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own \"happily ever after\" for ourselves.'\n\nAniston's reaction comes amid increased scrutiny into Vance's stances on women's health issues.\n\nNotably, Vance is not only anti-abortion (even in cases of rape and incest) but was one of only 28 members of Congress who opposed a new rule that would limit law enforcement's access to women's medical records.

Aniston has entered the 2024 election news cycle to call out former President Donald Trump's running mate -- \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author and Ohio Sen. JD Vance -- over his remarks about people who haven't borne children.\n\nJennifer Aniston has entered the 2024 election news cycle to call out former President Donald Trump's running mate -- \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author and Ohio Sen. JD Vance -- over his remarks about people who haven't borne children.\n\nThe Emmy winning \"Friends\" star on Wednesday shared her disbelief over a resurfaced clip of the GOP nominee for vice president, who in 2021 likened Democrats like Vice President Kamala Harris to \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.\" Vance said, \"They want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nPosting a tweet about the clip on her Instagram story, the actor wrote: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\"\n\n\"The Morning Show\" star, who opened up about her infertility struggles in 2022, then directed her comments to Vance himself while alluding to the Republican Party's support of personhood laws that would affect access to abortion, in vitro fertilization procedures and certain types of contraception.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" she wrote. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Aniston did not immediately respond today to The Times' request for comment.\n\nThe senator from Ohio, 39, was a candidate for the U.S. Congress when he made the remarks in 2021 on former Fox News host Tucker Carlson's show, but the clip has made the rounds on social media recently in the wake of Trump tapping his onetime critic as his VP pick at the Republican National Convention last week.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" Vance told Carlson.\n\nAfter taking aim at Vance, Aniston, 55, appeared to endorse Harris, who stepped into the race Sunday after President Joe Biden heeded widespread calls to drop out of the election. She reposted a 2018 video from fellow actor Allison Janney showing the former prosecutor and senator grilling Justice Brett Kavanaugh, then a Supreme Court nominee, on abortion rights.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Aniston provided rare insight into her attempts at parenthood and how the media scrutinized her about not having children during her high-profile marriages to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux.\n\n\"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" she told Allure. \"All the years and years and years of speculation. ... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nAniston said that the media painfully branded her as \"selfish\" and someone who \"just cared about her career.\"\n\n\"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she said. \"And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harris' stepdaughter Ella Emhoff and Ella's mother, Kerstin Emhoff, came to Harris' defense.\n\nElla Emhoff posted a statement her mother had given to CNN on her Instagram story on Thursday. In it, Kerstin Emhoff called the \"childless\" claims against Harris \"baseless\" and praised Harris as a \"co-parent\" to her two children with second gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\n\"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present,\" the statement said.\n\nElla Emhoff added: \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I. kemhoff say it louder for the people in the back...

You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\"\n\nHe added, \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nVice President Harris, whom President Joe Biden backed as the Democratic presidential nominee, is a stepmother to husband Douglas Emhoff's children with ex-wife Kerstin Emhoff, Cole and Ella Emhoff. U.S. Transportation Secretary Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, welcomed twins Penelope Rose and Joseph August in September 2021.\n\nRead on for the notable figures who have weighed in on Vance's controversial comments.\n\n'Sexism in action': Kamala Harris and when we reduce women to 'childless cat ladies'\n\nAniston on Wednesday took to her Instagram Stories to make a rare political statement.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" the \"Friends\" star wrote alongside a screenshot of a social media post with the Fox News video.\n\nShe added, \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF (in vitro fertilization) as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nThe actor could have been referring to The Right to IVF Act failing to advance in the U.S. Senate in June after most Republican representatives voted against the legislation.\n\nIn 2022, Aniston opened up about her fertility struggles in a cover story for Allure.\n\n\"I was trying to get pregnant,\" she said, referring to when she was in her late 30s into her 40s. \"It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road.\"\n\nShe added, \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nElla Emhoff, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff's youngest child, came to stepmom Harris' defense in an Instagram Story Thursday.\n\n\"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,\" the 25-year-old wrote alongside a screenshot of CNN's broadcast, which quoted her mother calling Harris a \"loving, nurturing (and) fiercely protective\" co-parent.\n\n\"@kemhoff say it louder for the people in the back,\" Ella Emhoff wrote. \"I love my three parents.\"\n\nCelebrities at the RNC: What to know about Savannah Chrisley, Amber Rose and more stars\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of \"The View,\" the hosts discussed Vance's 2021 comments, which Goldberg said were \"not really helping him connect with a lot of voters.\"\n\n\"Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason. There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you,\" Goldberg said. \"You never had a baby. Your wife had a baby. But you never had a baby, so you know nothing about this. How dare you.\"\n\nShe added, \"And women? You heard how he thinks of you. This is not good for you, JD.\"\n\nLater, Goldberg gave a history lesson, naming presidents George Washington, James Polk, James Buchanan (who was also never married) and Andrew Jackson as figures who did not have biological children.\n\n\"You know who else didn't have (biological) kids? George Washington, the father of our nation. But you know what he did? Like Kamala, he raised Martha (Washington)'s children. He raised them with her,\" Goldberg said.\n\nGriffin, who was formerly the communications director in Pres.

Vance is learning the hard way the internet doesn't just love cats but also childless cat ladies, as comments resurfaced in which he claimed those without offspring were less fit to govern.\n\nIn a 2021 clip, Vance singled out Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, among others as he told Fox News that those who hadn't procreated, particularly \"childless cat ladies,\" were \"miserable\" and had no \"direct stake\" in the country.\n\nThe comments have sparked a storm of scorn and accusations that the father of three represents an out-of-touch, sexist Republican mindset that has no place in the modern era.\n\n\"It would be funny if it wasn't so sad,\" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz told MSNBC, adding: \"My God, they went after 'cat people,' good luck with that!\"\n\nIf Harris, who has two stepchildren, beats Republican former president Donald Trump in November elections, she not only becomes the first woman president, but also the first woman of Black and Asian heritage, which has opened her up to a number of attacks along demographic lines.\n\nWhile multiple Republicans have flagged her lack of biological children as an issue, her online \"KHive\" of fans has been running defense -- via memes, indignation and supportive posts including from celebrities, politicians and members of her own family.\n\nAn outraged Jennifer Aniston pointed to her own infertility, which the actor has been vocal about in the past, while comedian and talk show host Whoopi Goldberg asked \"Now, what the hell?\"\n\n- 'Just a basic fact' -\n\nThe resurfaced 2021 clip shows Vance, then a US Senate candidate from Ohio, telling Fox's Tucker Carlson that the United States was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance said.\n\n\"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nButtigieg, who is the US transportation secretary and adopted two children that same year, told CNN the comments were hurtful given an adoption setback he was facing at the time.\n\n\"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nHarris has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella, through her husband Doug Emhoff and his first wife.\n\nTheir mother, Kerstin Emhoff, said in a statement to CNN that the attacks on Harris were \"baseless.\"\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" she said.\n\n\"I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nElla, age 25, who refers to Harris as \"Momala,\" meanwhile wrote on Instagram that \"I love my three parents.\"\n\n\"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I.\"\n\n- 'Leaders should have children' -\n\nHarris supporters were quick to point out that no US president has ever physically given birth, since all have been men. A handful have also never produced any offspring.\n\nChief among them was George Washington, America's first president who like Harris helped raise his spouse's children from a previous marriage.\n\nMeghan McCain, daughter of late Republican senator John McCain, warned that Vance's comments \"are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.\"\n\nThe focus on politicians' children comes as reproductive health and abortion access -- topics Harris has championed -- take center stage in this year's election.\n\n\"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married,\" venture capitalist and Trump-endorsed former congressional candidate Blake Masters wrote on X.\n\n\"If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations?\" he said.\n\nIn a 2021 speech, Vance went so far as to suggest people with children should have more votes.\n\n\"When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power,\" he said in quotes unearthed by the Washington Post, adding \"if you don't have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice.\"\n\nVance's campaign has since dismissed the comments as a \"thought experiment.\"\n\nbur-bfm/mlm", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Now, what the hell?\" Goldberg said after the show played a clip from the three-year-old discussion in which Vance said, \"We're effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nVance went on to specifically name Harris, Ocasio-Cortez, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg as those he disapproves of. \"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people that don't really have a direct stake in it?\" Vance asked Carlson.\n\nThe View's legal expert, Sunny Hostin, 55, called Vance's quotes \"a very myopic view\" of the country, and cited the significant voting block of Gen Z Americans \"that don't have children yet\" as those who should also be offended by Vance.\n\nLater, 35-year-old Alyssa Farah Griffin, who previously worked for Trump's White House communications team, brought up infertility and miscarriage rates in the United States as other reasons why Vance shouldn't have targeted childless people. \"How dare you denigrate them and say they are not as valuable or have as much of a stake,\" Griffin said.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nFinally, cohost Joy Behar, 81, urged Vance to \"do some work on guns and the climate\" as a means to protect future generations of children instead of criticizing people who don't have kids, but still have a voting voice in the country. \"In Project 2025, those things are going to be right out the window,\" she continued. \"Stop lecturing us on children.\"\n\nGoldberg closed the segment by asking Vance to look back through history to see which political figures also haven't had kids, but still made a lasting impact on American politics.\n\n\"You know who else didn't have [biological] kids? George Washington, the father of our nation. You know what he did? Like Kamala, he raised Martha's children. He raised them with her,\" Goldberg reminded Vance. \"James Polk had no children, James Buchanan, Andrew Jackson [had no biological children], because none of them could have kids. Children are very important to us as a nation ... we pay taxes not for the stuff that's for us, but how we help other people.\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly has reached out to Trump representatives for comment.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whoopi Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Many are whispering about this, and many comments he made in the past are being dragged back up. One of them has gone viral.\n\nMany of you may have heard vague references to Vance's 'cat comments.\" Allow me, if you will, to tell you the story of EXACTLY, what Vance said, and why these comments are coming back to bite him in the ass.\n\nAt one point, Vance implied that women shouldn't vote. He was talking about a specific type of woman: women without children and single women.\n\n\"Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is being controlled by people without children.\"\n\nI might remark on the fact that Mayor Pete is not childless. Vance, who could really be any woman-hating internet troll, appears to think only people with babies, with children should vote, as his comments indicated. But there is far more to the story.\n\nIn other comments, Vance mocked single women -- jeering at them, implying they were unhappy and miserable and that they'd made the wrong choices in life.\n\nBut Vance went even further! Yes, there is no low too low for Vance to go. He then lashed out about -- cats. I write these words, friends and readers, as I look across my home office to the cat who sleeps contentedly across from me. She's a tuxedo kitty, and she's just lovely -- all cats are lovely.\n\nCats are little bundles of fur and joy, are they not? Most adore them. Most love playing with these little precious gifts of delight that always put smiles on our faces. Maybe not on Vance's's face Because Vance said something pretty shocking about cats.\n\nThe country, Vance explained petulantly, is being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nWow! Please make sure EVERY person, particularly women and animal lovers are aware of these comments. So that's the story. I've always been suspicious of people who are cold toward animals. I'm even more suspicious of someone who equates \"cats\" with misery.\n\nThese words of JD can't are being passed around on Twitter and have gone viral, undoubtedly making many cat owners absolutely furious.\n\nIn a certain way, Trump picked the perfect running man. Vance is repelling (like Trump). He hates women (like Trump), is not an animal lover (like Trump), and has as much charisma as a rotting dumpster full of garbage.\n\nBut Vance will never be VP. We, the Democrats, including many cat lovers, will not let him.

Vance over 'childless cat ladies' view on Kamala Harris", "body": "Jennifer Aniston has entered the 2024 election news cycle to call out former President Trump's running mate -- \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance -- over his remarks about people who haven't borne children.\n\nThe Emmy-winning \"Friends\" star on Wednesday shared her disbelief over a resurfaced clip of the GOP nominee for vice president, who in 2021 likened Democrats like Vice President Kamala Harris to \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.\" Vance said, \"They want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nPosting a tweet about the clip on her Instagram Story, the actor wrote: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\"\n\n\"The Morning Show\" star, who opened up about her infertility struggles in 2022, then directed her comments to Vance himself while alluding to the Republican Party's support of personhood laws that would affect access to abortion, in vitro fertilization procedures and certain types of contraception.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" she wrote. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Aniston did not immediately respond Thursday to The Times' request for comment.\n\nThe senator from Ohio, 39, was a candidate for the U.S. Congress when he made the remarks in 2021 on former Fox News host Tucker Carlson's show, but the clip has made the rounds on social media recently in the wake of Trump tapping his onetime critic as his VP pick at the Republican National Convention last week.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" Vance told Carlson.\n\nAfter taking aim at Vance, Aniston, 55, appeared to endorse Harris, who stepped into the race Sunday after President Biden heeded widespread calls to drop out of the election. She reposted a 2018 video from fellow actor Allison Janney showing the former prosecutor and senator grilling Justice Brett Kavanaugh, then a Supreme Court nominee, on abortion rights.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Aniston provided rare insight into her attempts at parenthood and how the media scrutinized her about not having children during her high-profile marriages to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux.\n\n\"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" she told Allure. \"All the years and years and years of speculation. ... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nAniston said that the media painfully branded her as \"selfish\" and someone who \"just cared about her career.\"\n\n\"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she said. \"And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harris' stepdaughter Ella Emhoff and Ella's mother, Kerstin Emhoff, came to Harris' defense.\n\nElla Emhoff posted a statement her mother had given to CNN on her Instagram Story on Thursday. In it, Kerstin Emhoff called the \"childless\" claims against Harris \"baseless\" and praised Harris as a \"co-parent\" to her two children with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\n\"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present,\" the statement said.\n\nElla Emhoff added: \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I. @kemhoff say it louder for the people in the back... I love my three parents.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nardine_saad@latimes.com", "name": "Nardine Saad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance is running for vice president, one wonders if he privately regrets his choice of words in 2021 when he grumbled to Tucker Carlson that the Democratic Party is run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nIn that interview, the man recently selected as Donald Trump's running mate also falsely stated the Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg were childless, when he mentioned them as people \"without children\" who are running the country, even as they don't \"really have a direct stake in it.\"\n\nAs these comments are resurfacing, Vance has incited a variety of negative reactions, some darkly humorous and some angry and lacerating. His comments are seen as insulting to women and couples who don't have children; to anyone, like Harris, who is a stepparent; and to people, like Buttigieg, who have become parents through adoption. Female cat owners also have filled social media with defiant memes, proudly declaring their \"cat lady\" credentials.\n\nBut Vance's biggest regrets could come from annoying one particular constituency: Taylor Swift fans, aka Swifties. The social media platform X has been filled with speculation about how Swift would react, as one of the most powerful women in American culture and as the proud and adoring owner of three cats. In particular, people have shared the image of the pop megastar posing with one of her cats for Time magazine, when she was named that publication's Person of the Year in 2023.\n\n\"Hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate,\" one X user wrote, while sharing an image of the Swift cover. That post has been viewed more than 1 million times.\n\nTo this post, someone replied, \"A lot of cat ladies are gonna be mad.\"\n\nAnother Twitter user also shared the Time cover, with another warning to Vance and to Republicans: \"Wait till this cat lady unleashes her power to the young voters.\"\n\nSince Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race Sunday and endorsed Harris to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket, the question of whether Swift would also endorse Harris has been swirling around efforts to defeat Trump in November.\n\nIf Swift endorsed Harris, it would mean that the most famous entertainer on the planet right now was lending her considerable cultural power to back the Bay Area native in her quest to make history by becoming the first woman, the first Black woman and the first Asian American to become president of the United States.\n\nVanity Fair writer Kase Wickman wrote that Swift is \"the influencer to end all influencers, able to wield her massive popularity and power effectively enough to impact economies and legislation, moviemaking practices and album release strategies.\"\n\nWickman also noted that Forbes named Swift the fifth most powerful woman in the world, with her ability to reach her hundreds of millions of social media followers, many of whom are fiercely loyal. Her endorsement for Harris would be \"an incomparable asset to the former California senator's nascent 2024 presidential campaign,\" Wickman said.\n\nSwift has used her voice in the past to influence politics, mostly by driving voter registration efforts in state and national elections. She also endorsed Biden and Harris' successful run 2020, saying that the two in the White House would help heal the country after Trump stoked \"the fires of white supremacy and racism\" during his \"entire\" presidency from, 2017 to 2021.\n\nNow Vance is Trump's running mate as the former president seeks to return to the White House. But the Ohio senator's resurfaced Fox News comments, deriding childless Americans and female cat owners, have mired him in a national discussion about women's role in society and people's personal family choices.\n\nVance, a father of three, made the comments to address a controversial speech he had just given to the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, Today reported. In it, he called a number of prominent Democratic leaders the \"childless left,\" whom he said had \"no physical commitment to the future of this country.\"\n\nThe \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author also included New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in his list of the \"childless left.\" While it's true that AOC doesn't have children, others are saying, \"So what?\" Florida state Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, chided Vance said in an X post: \"As a childless cat lady I have a huge stake in America and am not miserable but thanks for your concern, Vance.\"\n\nAmid this controversy, Arwa Mahdawi, a columnist for The Guardian, produced an academic's view that mirrored what Eskamani said. Rather than being \"miserable,\" as Vance said, women who are child-free by choice are often happier and healthier than men and married women with children, Mahdawi wrote, citing a 2019 speech by Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics. Dolan made headlines when he cited evidence that women are happier without kids or a spouse, Mahdawi said.\n\n\"(If) you're a man, you should probably get married; if you're a woman, don't bother,\" Dolan joked about the longitudinal data suggesting \"the healthiest and happiest population subgroup are women who never married or had children.\" While Mahdawi said Dolan didn't address the happiness of women with cats, she said there is surely \"a case to be made that a feline friend only adds to life satisfaction.\"\n\nMore data could come from Swift herself. The 14-time Grammy winner seems be in a pretty good place with her life right now, as she winds up her blockbuster Eras tour this year, continues her very happy-looking romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and enjoys downtime with her three cats, as she contemplates the next arena of global culture that she'd conquer.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Martha Ross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_lady", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat lady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston wrote on her Instagram stories. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nIn 2022, Aniston gave rare comments in an Allure cover story, sharing for the first time that she struggled with her fertility and underwent IVF.\n\n\"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" Aniston said, reflecting on her 30s and 40s. \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nAniston's passionate words about Vance's comments come from a personal place, as the \"Friends\" star has personal experience being judged for not having children. Throughout her entire career, Aniston has been subjected to excessive tabloid coverage, which has repeatedly prodded into her relationships over the years and questioned why she does not have children.\n\nIn her Allure interview, Aniston said the media's narrative that she \"was just selfish\" and \"just cared about my career\" was painful.\n\n\"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she said in 2022. \"And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Aniston also appeared to give her endorsement to Harris by reposting a 2018 video of Harris pushing then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on abortion rights.\n\n(The video Aniston reposted was shared by actress Allison Janney.)\n\nReproductive health will be a key issue this election. Many women in Hollywood have spoken out about reproductive rights throughout the years and will align with Harris, who has been the Biden administration's leading voice on abortion and female healthcare.\n\nCNN has reached out to Aniston's representative for further comment on her post about Vance and her apparent endorsement of Harris.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Where does he stand on family issues?", "body": "When JD Vance ran for the Senate, he made headlines for calling Democratic leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris, \"childless cat ladies\" who don't have a stake in the country's future.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Vance told Tucker Carlson in 2021 when he was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat. \"It's just a basic fact: If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\"\n\nThe interview resurfaced this week while Vance made his debut on the campaign trail as Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate. His comments prompted swift criticism from Democrats and drew renewed attention to the Ohio senator's previous statements on divorce, domestic abuse and banning pornography.\n\nHarris is a stepmother to two children. Buttigieg and his husband adopted two kids and made the announcement within weeks of Vance's 2021 interview.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a really heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg told CNN this week. \"He couldn't have known that. But maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"\n\nHere's what else Vance has said about women and family policies.\n\nWhat Vance said about abortion as a Senate candidate\n\nVance opposes abortion and previously said he would \"like abortion to be illegal nationally.\" He compared abortion to slavery in a 2021 interview with the Catholic Current, saying both have a \"morally distorting effect\" on society.\n\nWhen asked by Spectrum News 1 that year if abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest, Vance said \"two wrongs don't make a right.\" The host followed up with another question: \"Should a woman be forced to carry a child to term after she has been the victim of incest or rape?\"\n\n\"My view on this has been very clear, and I think the question betrays a certain presumption that's wrong,\" Vance responded. \"It's not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term. It's whether a child should be allowed to live even though the circumstances of that child's birth are somehow inconvenient or a problem to the society. The question really to me is about the baby. We want women to have opportunities, we want women to have choices, but above all, we want women and young boys in the womb to have the right to life.\"\n\nA Democratic National Committee spokesperson panned Vance's comments this week and accused him of downplaying rape and incest. Vance's campaign has said media outlets misrepresented his comments.\n\n\"The Democrats have completely twisted my words,\" Vance told Fox News host Sean Hannity at the Republican National Convention. \"What I did say is that we sometimes in this society see babies as inconveniences, and I absolutely want us to change that.\"\n\nVance softens stance on abortion after losses at ballot box\n\nLike other Republicans, Vance moderated his position on abortion after Ohio and other GOP-leaning states voted to codify access to the procedure. The decisive vote in Vance's home state in 2023 came nearly 18 months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn a December CNN interview, Vance said Republicans must \"accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans.\" More recently, he told Meet the Press that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nJD Vance criticized for comments on violent marriages\n\nDuring a 2022 event at Pacifica Christian High School in California, Vance credited his grandparents for never divorcing even though they had an \"incredibly chaotic marriage.\"\n\n\"This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is this idea that like, well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy,\" Vance said. \"And so, getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that's going to make people happier in the long term. And maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I'm skeptical, but it really didn't work out for the kids of those marriages.\"\n\nCritics accused Vance of encouraging people to stay in violent marriages - something he rebuked after writing about domestic abuse during his own childhood.\n\n\"JD was raised by some of the strongest women I know and went on to marry an incredibly strong woman in Usha,\" Vance's sister, Lindsay Lewis, said in a statement. \"JD is a testament to the women in his life, and the attacks from the media and Democrats that assume anything otherwise are vile.\"\n\nVance wants people to have more children\n\nAs a Senate candidate, Vance touted a program in Hungary that awards loans to newlyweds and forgives the debt if they have kids. He also said children should be entitled to votes controlled by their parents, giving those parents more say in the country's future.\n\n\"We're not just worried about the lack of babies because it means our media is miserable and because it means our leaders are miserable,\" he said during a speech to the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. \"We're worried about babies because babies are good, and a country that has children is a healthy country that's worth living in.\"\n\nIn a 2021 interview with conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, Vance suggested people who don't have children should pay higher taxes: \"If you are making $100,000, $400,000 a year and you've got three kids, you should pay a different, lower tax rate than if you are making the same amount of money and you don't have any kids.\"\n\nHis comments from the since-deleted video were flagged in opposition research published by a pro-Vance super PAC in 2022.\n\nVance opposes same-sex marriage\n\nWriting under his previous legal name - JD Hamel - Vance in 2011 blasted conservatives who supported a proposal to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman.\n\nFast forward to his Senate campaign: Vance said he's against same-sex marriage and would not support federal legislation to codify marriage equality.", "source": {"uri": "thenews-messenger.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fremont News-Messenger"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Vance's Controversial Remarks on 'Childless Women' and Promises to 'Pray' for His Daughter, While Her Personal Struggle with Infertility Comes to Light Again - Internewscast Journal", "body": "Jennifer Aniston was critical of remarks made by Sen. J.D. Vance over 'childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives' while speaking about Vice President Kamala Harris in 2021.\n\nAniston, 55, took to Instagram Stories on Wednesday with sharp words for Vance, who is running as Donald Trump's vice presidential candidate, atop a clip of him speaking with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.\n\n'I truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,' the Friends star said on the social media platform. 'All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\n\n'I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.'\n\nThe comments Vance made in 2021 questioning Vice President Harris\u00b4 leadership because she did not have biological children resurfaced in recent days, testing the young conservative senator in his early days campaigning as part of the Republicans' presidential ticket.\n\nDuring Vance's bid for the Senate in Ohio, he said in a Fox News interview that 'we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats,' and referred to them as 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u00b4ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.'\n\nHe said that included Harris, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat.\n\nVance said to Carlson in the interview, 'It's just a basic fact - you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC - the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?'\n\nVance, 39, and wife Usha Vance, 38, have three kids - sons Ewan, six, and Vivek, four, and daughter Mirabel, two.\n\nHarris became stepmother to two children - Cole, 29, and daughter Ella, 25 - when she married entertainment lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014. Buttigieg announced he and his husband adopted infant twins in September 2021, more than a month before Vance made those comments.\n\nAniston, who can currently be seen on Apple TV+'s The Morning Show, has been candid about her issues with fertility and trying to have a child over the years.\n\nAniston, who was previously in marriages with Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux, chat with the publication Allure in December of 2022 about how she had past sought to have children more than a decade back.\n\nAniston told the publication, 'I would say my late 30s, 40s, I'd gone through really hard s***, and if it wasn't for going through that, I would've never become who I was meant to be.\n\n'That's why I have such gratitude for all those s****y things. Otherwise, I would've been stuck being this person that was so fearful, so nervous, so unsure of who they were. And now, I don't f***ing care.'\n\nShe expounded on her feelings, saying she 'was trying to get pregnant' during that timeframe.\n\n'It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,' Aniston said. 'All the years and years and years of speculation ... it was really hard.'\n\nAniston opened up about the multiple methods she explored in her attempts to become pregnant.\n\n'I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it,' Aniston said. 'I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, \"Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.\" You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.'\n\nAniston said things were 'really hard' for her emotionally in the years there were rumors she was pregnant; and the insinuations that she chose her show business career over having children were 'absolute lies.'\n\nShe said in the 2022 interview: 'I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, \"Can I?\" I don't have to think about that anymore.'\n\nIn November of 2022, an insider told People that the A-list actress remained 'at peace' and 'very happy in her life,' adding, 'She's in a great place, and she knows that ... kids or no kids, it didn't change her.'\n\nAniston in July of 2016 penned a piece for Huffington Post in which she stated her views on the years of speculation over her having kids, and how she felt validated regardless of if she's a parent or not.\n\n'Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child,' Aniston said. 'We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone.'\n\nShe added: 'Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples ... we don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own \"happily ever after\" for ourselves.'\n\nThe 2021 clip of Vance has spread online, with former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sharing it in a Tuesday post on X and adding sarcastically 'what a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn\u00b4t hate women having freedoms.'\n\nThe recirculated comment may be a sign of the GOP ticket\u00b4s troubles appealing to women voters, and on the issue of reproductive rights.\n\nIt follows the explosive entrance in the race of Harris, who secured the support of enough delegates to become the official nominee in less than 32 hours after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid.\n\nIt also lays out some of the fears expressed by strategists that Trump took a political risk in picking a running mate who has been in Congress less than two years and is largely untested on a bigger stage. Trump liked Vance\u00b4s telegenic qualities and said he reminded him of 'a young Abraham Lincoln.'\n\nThe Harris campaign contested Vance\u00b4s stance, saying 'every single American has a stake in this country\u00b4s future.'\n\n'Ugly, personal attacks from J.D. Vance and Donald Trump are in line with their dangerous Project 2025 agenda to ban abortion, decimate our democracy, and gut Social Security,' said James Singer, a Harris campaign spokesman, referring to a policy and personnel plan for a second Trump term that was crafted by a host of former administration officials.\n\nTrump has been trying to distance himself from it. Project 2025 says the Department of Health and Human Services should 'pursue a robust agenda' to protect 'the fundamental right to life.'\n\nHowever, the document contains no proposals to cut Social Security, though the Heritage Foundation that oversaw it has long pushed for changes to the entitlement. The plan outlines a dramatic expansion of presidential power and a plan to fire as many as 50,000 government workers.\n\nVance\u00b4s spokesperson said the Harris campaign is lying about Vance's views, noting her record is 'littered with countless failures and disasters.\n\n'It's well known that Senator Vance found success in life due in large part to the influence of strong female role models like his grandmother,' spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said.\n\nVance is a former Marine and businessman who was first elected to public office in 2022. He wrote the 2016 bestseller Hillbilly Elegy, and developed a strong rapport with Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and leading MAGA figures with his personal story of growing up in Appalachia in poverty with a mother battling drug addiction could resonate with voters.\n\nOne of the major questions Vance is facing is on his abortion stance. Vance previously said he would support a federal bill to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but believes in certain exceptions.\n\nIn 2021, Vance floated an idea to allow parents to cast ballots on behalf of their children, saying during a speech at the conservative nonprofit Intercollegiate Studies Institute in Virginia that people who don't have children 'don\u00b4t have as much of an investment in the future of the country.'\n\n'When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an availability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don\u00b4t have kids,' he said.\n\n'Doesn\u00b4t this mean that non parents don\u00b4t have as much of a voice as parents?' he said critics would then ask. 'Doesn\u00b4t this mean that parents get a bigger say in how a democracy functions? Yes, absolutely.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance For \"Childless Cat Lady\" Remarks", "body": "2024 Presidential Election Debate Schedule: Dates, Times, Who'll Be There And Who Won't\n\nMost recently, Donald Trump's newly-minted running mate has been grilled for resurfaced comments he made to Tucker Carlson in 2022 in which he said the U.S. was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nOne very popular actress, who has been public about her own struggle to conceive, took umbrage.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Jenner Aniston wrote today in a post on her Instagram Story. Aniston, generally very private, has shared her about IVF struggles in the past and coming to accept that \"we are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child.\"\n\nOf Vance's two-year-old daughter, Aniston wrote today, \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nVance has three children, sons Ewan, 6 and Vivek, 4 and daughter Mirabel, 2.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, one of those Vance dubbed \"childless cat ladies,\" spoke about Vance's stances on IVF and abortion in a Kalamazoo, MI campaign speech last week.\n\n\"Understand, this is a fellow who -- in the United States Senate -- participated in blocking protections for IVF. This is an individual who has made every indication that he is for a national abortion ban,\" said Harris.\n\nAniston has been outspoken on the subject before. After endless false tabloid pregnancy stories, the Emmy-winner wrote an essay for the Huffington Post in 2016 about the fixation on her romantic and pregnancy status.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone,\" wrote Aniston. \"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves.\"\n\nAniston told Allure magazine in 2022 that she had undergone IVF, and the pregnancy rumors made the process all the more difficult.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard,\" she said. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.\"\n\nIn Vance's 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Carlson, in which he decried so-called \"childless cat ladies,\" he namechecked Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance told Carlson. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nHarris, it turns out, is actually stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children: son Cole, 29, and daughter Ella, 25.\n\nEarlier this afternoon, New York Times White House reporter Katie Rogers noted that Kerstin Emhoff, Doug Emhoff's ex-wife, had the following to say about attacks on Harris for not having children of her own: \"These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nOf course, Buttigieg and his husband Chasten also have children, though the adoption process wasn't exactly easy. Asked about Vance's comments, Buttigieg took the high road while still making a very sharp point about civility.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg said on CNN. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_tapp@deadline.com", "name": "Tom Tapp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid (newspaper format)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerstin_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerstin Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1477726123.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAniston -- who typically keeps her personal life private, but has publicly spoken about her fertility journey -- also wrote about Vance's far-right stance on reproductive rights.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston wrote on her Instagram stories. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nIn 2022, Aniston gave rare comments in an Allure cover story, sharing for the first time that she struggled with her fertility and underwent IVF.\n\n\"I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" Aniston said, reflecting on her 30s and 40s. \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nAniston's passionate words about Vance's comments come from a personal place, as the \"Friends\" star has personal experience being judged for not having children. Throughout her entire career, Aniston has been subjected to excessive tabloid coverage, which has repeatedly prodded into her relationships over the years and questioned why she does not have children.\n\nIn her Allure interview, Aniston said the media's narrative that she \"was just selfish\" and \"just cared about my career\" was painful.\n\n\"God forbid a woman is successful and doesn't have a child,\" she said in 2022. \"And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn't give him a kid. It was absolute lies.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Aniston also appeared to give her endorsement to Harris by reposting a 2018 video of Harris pushing then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on abortion rights.\n\n(The video Aniston reposted was shared by actress Allison Janney.)\n\nReproductive health will be a key issue this election. Many women in Hollywood have spoken out about reproductive rights throughout the years and will align with Harris, who has been the Biden administration's leading voice on abortion and female healthcare.\n\nCNN has reached out to Aniston's representative for further comment on her post about Vance and her apparent endorsement of Harris.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news",

She shared a screenshot of a news report detailing her mother, Kerstin Emhoff's response to the \"childless\" remarks.\n\n\"These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and 1. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present,\" Kerstin declared, earning her daughter's praise.\n\nElla stressed that she and her brother considered themselves Harris' children, writing, \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I? @kemhoff say it louder for the people in the back. I love my three parents.\"\n\nHarris' stepdaughter's response to Vance comes at the heels of Jennifer Aniston's reply on her Instagram Story. The Blast reported that she bashed the senator's boxed mindset, reminding him of his status as a girl dad.\n\nAniston reposted a message highlighting Vance's words about \"childless\" women like Harris in powerful positions and lamented about having a senator like the Republican. \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" she began.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,\" Aniston concluded.\n\nVance's words hit too close to home for the \"Friends\" star as she has been open about her fertility struggles. In 2022, Aniston revealed she repeatedly tried and failed to make a baby, saying:\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.\"\n\nThe support for Harris began when a 2021 episode of Tucker Carlson's former Fox News show resurfaced on the internet. Vance, a candidate for the Ohio Senate at the time, bashed \"childless\" women for pursuing political careers.\n\nVance argued that the United States was governed by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable with their own lives and the choices they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance continued, adding:\n\n\"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nWhile Vance may believe \"childless\" women like Harris shouldn't be in powerful positions, some of the entertainment industry's biggest names beg to differ. The Blast reported that the VP's campaign received tremendous support from A-listers.\n\nThe list included British pop star Charli XCX, who tweeted: \"Kamala IS brat,\" referring to the title of her sixth album. She gave a detailed description of a \"brat\" on TikTok, noting the word referenced a \"very honest\" and \"very blunt\" individual.\n\nHer album's name is designed in a lowercase black font over a neon green background, and Harris' official X page for her campaign, @KamalaHQ, embodied the same style for their background image.\n\nOther celebrities like Ariana Grande, John Legend, Barbra Streisand, Mark Hamill, Jamie Lee Curtis, and director Spike Lee echoed their support for Harris on social media.\n\nAccording to reports, nearly 100,000 black men and women raised over two million dollars for Harris' campaign. These funds were raised within 48 hours of the VP announcing her presidential bid.\n\nThe Black community's support continued with Black Star Network founder Roland Martin co-hosting a \"Black Men for Harris\" call. The move raised $1.3 million in four hours for Harris' campaign on Monday, July 22.\n\nMore than 50,000 people joined the stream, including Don Cheadle, John Legend, Don Lemon, Hill Harper, Will Packer, Cory Booker, and Emil Wilbekin, to politicians like Sen. Raphael Warnock and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.\n\nKamala Harris is undoubtedly loved, but is it enough to win the presidential race?", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In the video, Vance argues that the United States is being governed by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance said.\n\n\"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nButtigieg, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, shared with CNN that Vance's comments were particularly painful for him, given that he was dealing with an adoption setback during that period.\n\n\"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nHarris has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella, from her husband Doug Emhoff's previous marriage. Their mother, Kerstin Emhoff, told CNN that the criticisms directed at Harris were \"baseless.\"\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" she said.\n\n\"I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nAt 25, Ella describes Harris as her \"Momala,\" meanwhile wrote on Instagram that \"I love my three parents.\" \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I.\"\n\nHarris supporters were quick to highlight that no U.S. president has ever given birth, as all have been men, and some have been childless. Among them was George Washington, the first president, who, like Harris, helped raise his spouse's children from a previous marriage.\n\nMeghan McCain, daughter of the late Republican Senator John McCain, cautioned that Vance's remarks \"are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.\"\n\nThe spotlight on politicians' children coincides with the growing prominence of reproductive health and abortion access -- issues that Kamala Harris has actively supported -- becoming central to this year's election.\n\n\"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married,\" venture capitalist and Trump-endorsed former congressional candidate Blake Masters wrote on X.\n\n\"If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations?\" he said.\n\nIn a 2021 speech, Vance even proposed that individuals with children should have more voting power.\n\n\"When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power,\" he said in quotesrevealed by the Washington Post, adding \"if you don't have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice.\"\n\nVance's campaign has since characterized the comments as a \"thought experiment.\"\n\n(Includes inputs from online sources)", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

The line caught my eye at the time, and I talked to him about how it fit into his broader philosophy in 2022, when he was on the verge of winning the Republican nomination in Ohio's Senate race.\n\nVance told me that the \"childless left\" idea grew out of a conversation with a friend who noted that Washington, D.C. was near the top of lists of cities where adults had the fewest children. (As The Atlantic's Derek Thompson has noted, it's partly due to the constant flow of young professionals who move later on).\n\n\"I was like -- oh, that's really odd, right?\" Vance recalled. \"The city that's governing for the rest of the country is also the place that, in some ways, is the least like the rest of the country, where most people do want to have children, and most people do start families.\"\n\nThe childless factor, said Vance, might explain why so many policymakers favored school mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"When you have children, and you've interacted with children regularly, I think you realize how many of the left policies are really harmful to kids,\" he said. \"That was the most egregious example.\"\n\nA self-described \"natalist\" with three young children, Vance is now the most influential Republican advocate of a movement to encourage more marriage, and easier family formation. That might include cash and healthcare incentives that his party was doctrinally opposed to, but that self-described \"national conservatives\" wanted to try, after seeing them implemented in Viktor Orban's Hungary. He's also decried the prevalence of divorce and its impact on children, including with comments that have also attracted attention in recent days.\n\nThose views didn't make it into the new GOP platform, and Democrats believe they're offering more credible pro-child policies this year. In her maiden speeches as the likely Democratic nominee, Harris promised more affordable child care and paid family leave. She's also the stepmother of Cole and Ella Emhoff, and often mentions the name they call her: \"Momala.\"\n\nVance's rhetoric also connects with another topic that's consumed his corner of the intellectual right in recent years: Acceptance of the transgender community and their access to health care. In a 2022 criticism of the pharmaceutical industry, published by the American Principles Project, Vance fretted that \"progressive gender theory\" was being embraced by some parents who, instead of identifying the source of \"mental confusion\" in their children, gave them medication that delayed puberty and might affect their fertility.\n\n\"Gender dysphoria is good for business,\" Vance wrote, arguing -- without evidence -- that big pharma was driving recent increases in treatment as part of a larger plot to boost profits. \"Puberty blockers for 12-year-olds become antidepressants for 22-year-olds become fertility treatments for 32-year olds.\"\n\nElon Musk has struck the same notes, on natalism (\"population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming\") and on gender identity. These are popular worries among Silicon Valley conservatives, many of whom Vance knows. Peter Thiel, whom Vance has called a \"mentor,\" helped fund his 2022 race and the Arizona U.S. Senate bid of his former foundation president Blake Masters. Now running for a safe GOP House seat near Phoenix, Masters has gone after Trump-endorsed opponent Abe Hamedeh, who's 33, for not having children.\n\n\"I've got a wonderful wife. I've got four beautiful boys. That's called skin in the game,\" Masters said at an April candidate debate. \"What we don't need is someone with no wife and kids, right? No skin in the game.\"\n\nButtigieg, who was in the process of adopting twins when Vance made the \"childless left\" remarks, has criticized the line repeatedly.\n\n\"The really sad thing is, he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg told CNN on Tuesday. \"He couldn't have known that but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\" The election should be about all Americans' families, he added, not questions about the families of politicians.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

It's petty, yes, but it underscores a vital question: if procreation is what matters to Vance and his party, why aren't they doing more to support women?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has officially entered the 2024 presidential race, and many corners of the internet have been nothing less than celebratory at the prospect of a reinvigorated Democratic candidate. Yet amid the 'Kamala is Brat' discourse and coconut-themed memes, something surfaced yesterday on X that punctuated my own cautious optimism: a three-year-old clip of JD Vance talking about Harris on Fox News.\n\nVance -- who has since been chosen by Donald Trump to be his running mate -- tried to make the case that some of the most visible democrats at that time were \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives, and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of this country miserable too.\" And it didn't stop there. Vance, who was at the time running for U.S. Senate, started to name check. \"You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigeg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio Cortez]. The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nThe cat lady clip has been viewed more than 15 million times on X since it was excavated and posted on Monday and understandably, people are disgusted by it.\n\nIn the year 2024, we shouldn't have to spend a lot of time explaining why Senator Vance's beliefs are fundamentally flawed. There's the fact that Vice President Harris is the beloved stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children, Ella and Cole, and that many successful American leaders haven't had children (George Washington comes to mind). There's the assumption that people without kids are inherently unhappy, even though research shows there is no difference in life satisfaction between parents and childfree people.\n\nBut more importantly, the idea that someone like the Vice President who has never had biological children -- despite her resume as a former Attorney General and Senator -- is therefore less qualified to lead, or less invested in the fate of the nation, is ludicrous. As someone who has chosen to be childfree, I would argue that being alive on this planet is enough to give a person a vested interest in shaping its future.", "source": {"uri": "glamour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamour.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_childlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voluntary childlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/66a1084ce3642ddcf7eb1d07/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0723-JDKamala.png?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

J.D. Vance (R-OH), for criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for being 'childless' in a resurfaced 2021 video clip.\n\nDuring Vance's bid for the Senate in July 2021, he told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that \"we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.\"\n\n\"They want to make the rest of the country miserable too. It's a basic fact. Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC. The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" he added. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" co-host Whoopi Goldberg said, pausing for dramatic effect. \"There are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason. There are people who want to have children who cannot - how dare you!?\"\n\n\"You never had a baby. Your wife had a baby. But you never had a baby. So, you know nothing about this. And how dare you?! And women, you heard how he thinks of you,\" Goldberg declared.\n\n\"This is not good for you, J.D.,\" she added while looking at the television camera as if speaking to Vance directly.\n\n\"It's so mean against cats,\" co-host Joy Behar quipped.\n\nCo-host Sara Haines disagreed with Vance that her children had any factor in her political opinions.\n\n\"The part that really disgusts me is that he thinks by the fact you have children that's how you look through the lens of politics,\" Haines said. \"I have children, and I can assure you that is not my first thought when I think about politics. My kids are obviously going to be affected by that, but anyone with a heart will look at the moral clarity of the decisions we're making.\"\n\nHaines went on to defend abortion and shared her concerns about the environment and poverty.\n\n\"My kids have something to eat,\" she said. \"I've had something to eat every meal of my life. Sometimes too much to eat, but my point here is it's not my kids I'm worried about. It's every kid, every person, and every human that doesn't, so if you have a heart in your chest and are only looking through the lens of your own family, you are part of the problem.\"\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin said Vance's comments were a \"myopic view\" of the childless who may not choose to have children, can't have children, or college-aged voters who don't have children yet.\n\nCo-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said her lifelong girlfriend's friends have strong feelings about Vance's comments.\n\n\"I'm hearing from so many girlfriends, lifelong Republicans that are offended. If you're a woman of my age, mid-30s, the most common things my friends are dealing with are infertility, miscarriages, struggling to get pregnant, and people who so badly want to get married but haven't met the right partner yet. How dare you denigrate them and say they are not as valuable and don't have as much of a stake in society?\", Griffin asked Vance.\n\n\"Finally how dare you come for cat ladies?\", she snarked. \"The cover of Time magazine was Taylor Swift, the ultimate, fabulous cat lady!\"\n\nThe ladies on the panel then all celebrated that they were self-proclaimed \"cat ladies.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I'm a cat lady,\" Hostin, a mother of two children, said.\n\nGoldberg, the mother of one daughter, laughed while pointing at herself, \"I'm the ultimate cat lady!\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "heather_hunter@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Heather Hunter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Haines", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sara Haines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The remarks have recirculated in recent days, following his selection as Trump's running mate earlier this month.\n\nLeavitt posted a clip of Vance speaking at the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, where he said his sentiment doesn't target people who \"struggled to find the right girl, find the right guy\" or the people who \"for biological, medical reasons, they can't have children.\" Vance said his remarks were directed at Democrats who can have children but choose not to.\n\nIn the 30-second clip Leavitt posted, Vance did not name Harris, but his remarks earned him an invite to Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in July 2021. Vance, who was then campaigning for Senate, joined the conservative pundit to clarify his comments after they drew criticism.\n\nOn the show, he said what he was saying was that the country is run by Democrats and \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.\"\n\n\"And so, they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it's just a basic fact,\" Vance said at the time. \"You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.)], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nVance's comments have returned to the spotlight since Harris took over President Biden's presidential campaign after he stepped aside, positioning her to clinch the party's nomination at next months Democratic National Convention.\n\nHarris, who is a stepmother to two adult children, has pushed back on the comments. Her campaign social media account posted another clip of Vance speaking at the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, in which he says parents should have more of a say than non-parents in America's democracy.\n\nVance's comments also drew criticism from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg, who now has twins, said it was sad Vance made the remarks because he and his husband Chasten Buttigieg had recently gone through a \"heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey\" at the time. But he acknowledged Vance couldn't have known that and said \"maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"\n\nActress Jennifer Aniston also took to social media to share her thoughts, saying she \"truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.\" Aniston told Vance that she prays his daughter is \"fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_irwin@thehill.com", "name": "Lauren Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intercollegiate Studies Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasten_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chasten Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Children's_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Children's Writing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Children", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Children", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/vancejd_071724gn14_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Vance, R-Ohio, made the comment during an appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show, singling out Vice President Kamala Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as having no direct stake in the country's future because they do not have progeny.\n\nIn the clip, Vance goes on to say that the women he's referencing \"are miserable in their own lives and the choices that they've made, so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too. And it's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children, and how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" Jennifer Aniston, who does not have children of her own and has been candid about her journey with in vitro fertilization, wrote on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston continues. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nHarris does not have any biological children, but has two stepchildren since marrying Doug Emhoff in 2014. Buttigieg is also a father, having adopted twins in 2021.\n\n\"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?\" Ella Emhoff wrote on Instagram Thursday.\n\nDoug Emhoff's ex-wife, film producer Kerstin Emhoff, also came to her defense, called such attacks \"baseless\" in a statement to The New York Times and CNN.\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" Kerstin Emhoff said. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nOn ABC's \"The View\" this week, moderator Whoopi Goldberg did not mince words in responding to Vance's comments.\n\n\"Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you. You never had a baby; your wife had a baby. But, you never had a baby, so you know nothing about this. How dare you?\"\n\n\"Women? You heard how he thinks of you,\" Goldberg added.\n\nGoldberg's former \"View\" co-host Meghan McCain echoed a similar sentiment on social media, saying that she has \"been trying to warn every conservative man I know - these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.\"\n\n\"These comments have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian,\" McCain, the daughter of the late Republican Sen. John McCain, continued. \"This is not who we are.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Harris campaign posted a clip of a Vance speech, where he said, \"When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don't have kids.\"\n\nIn a post on social media honoring IVF Day, which is observed on July 25, Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said: \"Happy World IVF Day to everyone except JD Vance.\"\n\n\"True to form, JD Vance is marking World IVF Day by insulting couples struggling with infertility, demeaning women's choices and their freedoms and reminding voters about his and Donald Trump's anti-IVF Project 2025 agenda,\" she said in a statement.\n\nChitika called out Vance for voting against legislation to protect IVF access and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump for nominating an anti-IVF judge to the federal bench.\n\nParenthood has become an unexpected flash point in this year's election cycle, and not just in the race for the White House.\n\n\"Political leaders should have children,\" Blake Masters, a venture capitalist who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2022, posted to X on Wednesday. Masters is running to represent Arizona in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations? Skin in the game matters.\"\n\nMasters is running against Abe Hamadeh to succeed outgoing Rep. Debbie Lesko, and will face off against Hamadeh, who is not married and does not have kids, in a primary next week.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay

The childless cat lady community goes claws out for the Trump campaign - Queerty", "body": "The Trump campaign just made its gravest error yet: they f*cked with cat people.\n\nIt all started with a recently resurfaced Fox News interview between Trump's \"deeply weird and creepy\" VP pick, J.D. Vance, and Tucker Carlson from July 2021.\n\nWhilst attacking the left, the Ohio senator told the infamous news commentator: \"We're effectively run in this country ... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nThe apparent Diet Mountain Dew enthusiast then went on to attack specific Democratic leaders like Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and AOC, asserting that \"the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children\" and \"we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it.\"\n\nFor one thing, his critiques were not only unwarranted, but untrue. Vice President Harris has two stepchildren and Buttigieg had already become a father after adopting twins with his husband Chasten.\n\nPlus, as Buttigieg recently explained to CNN, it's wildly inappropriate to talk about someone else's family nor connect that to their \"direct stake\" in the future.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" he said. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"\n\nGet him, Pete!\n\nStill, Vance's biggest mistake was evidently using the words \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz -- who's been crushing it with the commentary on r X -- said as much in a recent interview on MSNBC: \"They went after cat people, good luck with that. Turn on the internet and see what cat people do when you go after that.\"\n\nHe added, \"It would be funny, if it wasn't so sad. They see the least fortunate among us as scapegoats and punchlines for them. Kamala Harris and Democrats see them as our neighbors.\" Purr indeed!\n\nFittingly, the \"childless cat ladies\" of the internet are speaking out en masse.\n\nJennifer Aniston, who rarely makes political statements, shared a clip of Vance's comments to her Instagram Story.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,\" the actress wrote. \"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nWho's licking their paws now, J.D.?\n\nMoreover, the internet was quick to point out that Taylor Swift -- a.k.a. the biggest celebrity in the world right now -- is, in fact, a childless cat lady.\n\nLooks like it's working out pretty well for her. Meow!\n\nNow, childless cat people on social media -- many of whom are part of the LGBTQ+ community -- are rising up to call out Vance and Trump's platform.\n\nAs X user @EdMcKeown wrote, \"I'm a gay childless cat dad, and I'll be voting for Kamala. Not because I'm gay, not because I'm childless, not because I'm a cat dad.

In 2020, she shared a photo of herself voting for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and now, with all eyes on JD Vance, she's speaking out about one of his worst comments \u23e4 one of many, that is.\n\nWhen Vance recently talked about \"childless cat ladies,\" he made many Americans shudder in horror and reminded them why he would be the most ill-suited VP this side of Sarah Palin. Television lovers the world over have adored Aniston since her Rachel Green days and have seen her through many great roles (and hairstyles), so they naturally perked up when she decided to speak her mind regarding the Hillbilly Elegy mouthpiece.\n\nAccording to People, Aniston posted a screenshot from Fox News of JD Vance's comments on her Instagram Stories, writing, \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States. All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day\" \u23e4 because, if his daughter needed IVF \u23e4 \"you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nAs People pointed out, Aniston and her former husband Brad Pitt didn't have any children. After they got divorced in 2005 and Aniston married Justin Theroux in 2015, fans continued wondering whether or not she would ever choose to start a family. It was only when the actress gave an incredibly vulnerable interview to Allure in 2022 that we learned she couldn't have children after trying IVF and experiencing infertility.\n\nWhile we would like to believe that politicians would be understanding of fertility problems and the devastating mental health consequences they can have on women, we know that's unfortunately not the case with a staggering number of candidates. Aniston was right to call out Vance's refusal to support IVF; as Northwestern Now reported, Vance voted that he didn't want the Right to IVF Act in June 2024. As reproductive endocrinology and infertility associate professor Dr. Eve Feinberg told the publication, \"There's a war on women more so than there's a war on abortion.\" It's no wonder why rumors are swirling that the GOP is having second thoughts about Donald Trump's decision to choose Vance as his running mate.\n\nAniston's comments echo what many in prominent positions have said about Vance. Jen O'Malley, the campaign manager for President Joe Biden's re-election bid (which is now over), said Vance is \"proudly anti-choice and wants to take women back decades,\" according to CBS News. That's one of the nicer things said about Vance, who has been called \"soul-crushing\" and compared to a head of lettuce.\n\nIf we're going to trust someone to talk about IVF and the tragic nature of not being able to have biological children, we're going to want to hear from someone like Aniston, who has been through this herself. Vance is fully ignoring the very real implications of anti-abortion and anti-IVF policies, which is just one reason why Democrats would argue Trump can't win the election in November. There's also a lot more to say on this matter, from the wildly unfair costs of IVF to how insurance doesn't cover everything (if it covers anything) to how lonely it can be. Let's hope for all of our sakes that the candidate who actually understands this complex issue wins \u23e4 regardless of whether or not her pets are cats.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aya_tsintziras@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Aya Tsintziras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Green", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Palin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Elegy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillbilly Elegy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Theroux", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Theroux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endocrinology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jennifer-Aniston-and-JD-Vance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The fact is that Vance's colorful language accurately describes a real and troubling phenomenon amongst a certain segment of childless women (not I hasten to add, all childless women) in America.\n\nSoon after Vance announced his candidacy for the Ohio Senate stated during a speech that \"the childless left\" isn't committed to America's future because, without offspring, leftists have no direct stake in the future. In response to Tucker Carlson's inquiries, Vance expanded on what he meant by that observation:\n\nWe're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\n\nAnd it's just a basic fact. You look, Kamala Harris. Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\n\nI just wanted to ask that question and propose that, maybe, if we want a healthy ruling class in this country, we should invest more, we should vote more, we should support more people who actually have kids because those are the people who ultimately have a more direct stake in the future of this country.\n\nThe obvious suspects -- the leftist childless cat ladies who chose careers over having children -- were outraged. A Google search revealed that among those most outraged was actress Jennifer Aniston (55 years old), a Democrat, Aniston's outrage even made The Hill:\n\nJennifer Aniston, who's been open about her fertility struggles, is ripping Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance for the Ohio senator's previous remarks dubbing Vice President Harris one of several \"childless cat ladies\" in Washington.\n\n[snip]\n\nIn her social media post, Aniston shared a message with her nearly 45 million Instagram followers directed at Vance: \"I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to [in vitro fertilization] as a second option.\"\n\n\"Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,\" Aniston, 55, said.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, the Emmy Award winner said she tried to get pregnant for several years and underwent unsuccessful rounds of in vitro fertilization.\n\nNeither Vance nor Trump, of course, has made an attack on in vitro fertilization. Indeed, Trump strongly supports IVF, but the truth never bothers Democrats.\n\nWhat The Hill doesn't mention, but Aniston admits in an Allure article, is that her IVF attempts were in her late 30s and early 40s. At that stage, most women have already zoomed past peak and even less peak fertility and are into the stage where they're saying, \"I hope that having spent my childbearing years chasing a career, science can step in and give me a baby.\"\n\nI'm not being mean. I'm speaking the truth because I almost waited too long and needed medical intervention (although not IVF) to get pregnant at 35. Had I waited another year, it would almost certainly have been too late. Moreover, it wasn't just my career that kept me out of the baby-making business. Instead, it was the immature pleasure of being a relatively affluent adult who could live an incredibly self-centered life. I was one of those childless adults at Disneyland.\n\nKids blew that life entirely apart. When they were very little, I was no longer the master of my own destiny, and I hated it. As my kids got older, I still had to put my needs on the back burner because my children's needs were always infinitely greater than mine.\n\nParenting was the most exhausting, frustrating, and challenging job I ever had. It was also, bar none, the most fulfilling, important thing I've done. It made me a hugely better person (especially by destroying my post-adolescent selfishness) because I needed to be the best person for them. Today, their very existence gives me infinite joy.\n\nMy kids' existence is also the jet fuel for the work I do. When politics overwhelm and depress me, I say to myself, \"None of this really matters because I'm going to be dead soon, anyway.\" Then I shake myself like a wet dog and think, \"But my children aren't going to die. I'm building their world, and my grandchildren's world, with every word I write.\"\n\nSo, I know Jennifer Aniston and the others like her. And to be very clear, I'm not talking about women who desperately want children, not as a Hollywood accessory or a career afterthought, but because they want to fulfill their destiny as women but for whatever reason, have been unable to do so. These aren't women whose childlessness is driven by devotion to a corporation or to self but by sheer bad luck. In other words, most of them probably aren't self-centered and immature.\n\nI'm also not talking about some of the wonderful women I know who are childless by choice but who moved beyond the selfish immaturity of the left. These women, invariably conservative, aren't invested in dystopian Marxist nightmares that require world depopulation and intersectional divisions. They altruistically look to the future of all children in the absence of their own.\n\nBut for the most part, much as feminists may inveigh against it, children are good for women because they usefully burn up the emotional energy that Nature gave women to expend on their children. Women who have been told that children will destroy planet Earth take that same energy and, driven by their leftist nightmares, go crazy.\n\nThese crazy women are the ones in the front line of the pro-Hamas movement (and Hamas hates women), the climate change movement (which dooms mankind to cold, dark, death-ridden pre-modern times), the open border (which floods the country with illiterate, often criminal, people who have medieval attitudes but are required to take the place of America's missing children), the transgender movement (which sterilizes people), and, of course, abortion.\n\nThey are the middle-aged white women crowding around Kamala Harris in her first big campaign appearance,\n\nAnd the hate-filled women who appear in the trailer for Matt Walsh's upcoming movie examining the DEI movement:\n\nIn other words, Vance was targeting a very specific class of \"childless cat ladies.\" These are women who've never grown beyond being a 14-year-old adolescent reading scary dystopian fiction or focusing obsessively on her body. Bounded by their fears and obsessions, they hysterically seek to tamp down those concerns by exerting a form of control over the world that will make it a very bad place in future.\n\nOnly those childless women who have given in to this madness should take umbrage at Vance's words because he was definitely talking to them. Everyone else, whether childless or not, needs to stand down.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Vance calls Kamala Harris a \"childless cat lady\"\n\nJ.D. Vance called Kamala Harris a \"childless cat lady.\"\n\nMaven - Meidas Touch\n\nYou've probably heard the words \"childless cat lady\" before. Maybe you've lived in fear of it. Or maybe you are one, and don't know why people treat it like it's a bad thing.\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance referred to Vice President (and current frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination) Kamala Harris as one of them. He spoke with Tucker Carlson on Fox News in July 2021, when Vance was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country ... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Vance told Carlson. \"It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\" Harris has two stepchildren with her husband, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.\n\nJennifer Aniston, who doesn't have children, called out Vance on her Instagram story: \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" And many Swifties pounced at Vance's resurfaced comments, willing to defend Taylor Swift's honor as a mother of only cats.\n\nWhere did this term come from, exactly, and why do we rarely hear a man described as childless in this same manner? Chalk it up to \"straight-up sexism and heterosexism.\"\n\n\"Women often are likened to cats in a pejorative way -- for example, a common insult is to call a woman 'catty,' says Leora Tanenbaum, author of \"I Am Not a Slut: Slut-Shaming in the Age of the Internet.\" \"With a man, on the other hand, you would never use that word and are more likely to describe him as 'spiteful.' And we describe arguments between women as 'catfights,' while an argument between men is just, well, an 'argument.'\"\n\n\"The expectation that all women will and should become mothers was forged by a long history that understood reproduction as American women's primary civic contribution,\" says Peggy Heffington, an assistant senior instructional professor at the University of Chicago who teaches and writes on feminism, women's movements and motherhood in American and European history.\n\nThey couldn't vote, couldn't own property, couldn't open a credit card. Just because these institutions shifted doesn't mean more ephemeral expectations did.\n\n\"The 'cat lady' stereotype is an extension of dominant beliefs about what femininity should look like,\" adds Tanenbaum. \"If a woman is unmarried or childless, she goes against expectations for her gender role, which is to be partnered with a man and devote herself to her biological family. It's OK if she works, but not if she's too ambitious and puts her career above her family.\"\n\nUnmarried or childless men don't get the same treatment. A single man is referred to as a \"bachelor\" and his living arrangements an enviable \"bachelor pad.\" That's because a childless male \"isn't violating gender norms. This is sexism in action.\"\n\nPlus, harping on women's lack of children sends a dangerous message to those unable to have them, as Aniston noted. \"For women who are unable to bear children due to medical complications, this increases their sense of guilt and worthlessness,\" says psychologist Rene\u00e9 Carr. \"Or, if a woman simply chooses to not have children and to focus on her career instead, it adds an extreme amount of undue pressure and makes her more likely to experience depression or have lower life mortality.\"\n\nSome of the judgment may even be coming from other women, according to Maryanne Fisher, a psychology professor at St. Mary's University in Canada, who is researching how married women plus those in committed relationships see single women. \"Signs indicate that it is even more of an issue if the single woman is considered attractive. They don't need to know the single women, they merely need to see an image to feel threatened, as though their romantic relationship could be in danger.\"\n\nMore details: Jennifer Aniston hits back at JD Vance's viral 'childless cat ladies' comments\n\n'There's nothing wrong with cats and there's nothing wrong with women'\n\nThe \"cat lady\" insult specifically carries with it some connotations. \"You are physically unattractive, or a workaholic, which makes you a deviant person; no wonder you have a pet cat, because that's the only one who loves you,\" Tanenbaum says. Tell that to all the Swifties who bought tickets to her groundbreaking Eras tour and firing up social media retorts to Vance's comments.\n\n\"I have loved the memes that people have been coming back with in response. It's telling me that folks in this campaign are feeling a lot of joy and promise,\" says Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund. \"They're letting the cruelty of those sorts of remarks roll off and responding with a lot of joy reminding people that there's nothing wrong with cats and there's nothing wrong with women.\"\n\nStill, it's no joke for impressionable kids. \"These type of messages tell young girls, to limit your aspirations to only being a wife and a mother,\" Carr says. \"For females who desire other types of success, these messages clearly communicate that, 'despite your achievements and sacrifices for your career, none of that matters because you are not a mother.'\"\n\nAnd more here too: Internet warns JD Vance after video resurfaces implying Kamala Harris is childless cat lady\n\nShe suggests people combat this thinking in society by addressing gender stereotypes head on. \"Pointing out inappropriate comments and phrases can raise awareness about how these beliefs affect not just women, but also younger people. We don't want children growing up to believe that girls have to become moms in order to matter to society.\"\n\nTime will tell if Vance will further meow-th off about all this. But if he does, expect many to put their paws up.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kamala_harris@usatoday.com", "name": "Kamala Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Where does he stand on family issues?", "body": "When JD Vance ran for the Senate, he made headlines for calling Democratic leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris, \"childless cat ladies\" who don't have a stake in the country's future.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Vance told Tucker Carlson in 2021 when he was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat. \"It's just a basic fact: If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\"\n\nThe interview resurfaced this week while Vance made his debut on the campaign trail as Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate. His comments prompted swift criticism from Democrats and drew renewed attention to the Ohio senator's previous statements on divorce, domestic abuse and banning pornography.\n\nHarris is a stepmother to two children. Buttigieg and his husband adopted two kids and made the announcement within weeks of Vance's 2021 interview.\n\n\"The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a really heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg told CNN this week. \"He couldn't have known that. But maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"\n\nHere's what else Vance has said about women and family policies.\n\nVance opposes abortion and previously said he would \"like abortion to be illegal nationally.\" He compared abortion to slavery in a 2021 interview with the Catholic Current, saying both have a \"morally distorting effect\" on society.\n\nWhen asked by Spectrum News 1 that year if abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest, Vance said \"two wrongs don't make a right.\" The host followed up with another question: \"Should a woman be forced to carry a child to term after she has been the victim of incest or rape?\"\n\n\"My view on this has been very clear, and I think the question betrays a certain presumption that's wrong,\" Vance responded. \"It's not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term. It's whether a child should be allowed to live even though the circumstances of that child's birth are somehow inconvenient or a problem to the society. The question really to me is about the baby. We want women to have opportunities, we want women to have choices, but above all, we want women and young boys in the womb to have the right to life.\"\n\nA Democratic National Committee spokesperson panned Vance's comments this week and accused him of downplaying rape and incest. Vance's campaign has said media outlets misrepresented his comments.\n\n\"The Democrats have completely twisted my words,\" Vance told Fox News host Sean Hannity at the Republican National Convention. \"What I did say is that we sometimes in this society see babies as inconveniences, and I absolutely want us to change that.\"\n\nLike other Republicans, Vance moderated his position on abortion after Ohio and other GOP-leaning states voted to codify access to the procedure. The decisive vote in Vance's home state in 2023 came nearly 18 months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn a December CNN interview, Vance said Republicans must \"accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans.\" More recently, he told Meet the Press that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nDuring a 2022 event at Pacifica Christian High School in California, Vance credited his grandparents for never divorcing even though they had an \"incredibly chaotic marriage.\"\n\n\"This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is this idea that like, well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy,\" Vance said. \"And so, getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that's going to make people happier in the long term. And maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I'm skeptical, but it really didn't work out for the kids of those marriages.\"\n\nCritics accused Vance of encouraging people to stay in violent marriages - something he rebuked after writing about domestic abuse during his own childhood.\n\n\"JD was raised by some of the strongest women I know and went on to marry an incredibly strong woman in Usha,\" Vance's sister, Lindsay Lewis, said in a statement. \"JD is a testament to the women in his life, and the attacks from the media and Democrats that assume anything otherwise are vile.\"\n\nAs a Senate candidate, Vance touted a program in Hungary that awards loans to newlyweds and forgives the debt if they have kids.

Vance for Resurfaced 'Childless Cat Ladies' Comments", "body": "Jennifer Aniston has spoken out about Republican Vice President nominee J.D. Vance's previous \"cat ladies\" comments. In a resurfaced video from 2022, J.D. Vance appears on the now-canceled Tucker Carlson Tonight show during his run for State Senate. In the clip, he says the Democratic Party is run \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.\" He also tries to call out prominent Democratic figures like Vice President and potential Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transport Pete Buttigieg, and New York House Representative Alexandra Oscasio-Cortez by saying:\n\n\"The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nAniston took to her social media to call out J.D. Vance's rude and ignorant comment. The actress said in a post on Instagram, where she calls into question that a potential Vice President of the United States could say such things and highlights Vance's history with blocking IVF treatment. Vance has voted against the Right to IVF Act and also praised the Supreme Court's controversial choice to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Aniston herself has spoken at length about her own difficult history of attempting IVF procedures. Read her statement below:\n\n\"I truly cannot believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States. All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nJ.D. Vance's Flawed Statement Close\n\nVance's controversial statement is certainly fitting for the running mate of former president and now Presidential nominee Donald Trump. Trump has no shortage of controversial public statements to his name that would have seemed unbelievable for a potential President in years gone by. The controversial Access Hollywood tape that leaked in October 2016, where Trump and television host Billy Bush had a lewd conversation about women, which was recorded in 2005, was equivalent to pushing for sexual assault. Trump's history of allegations in this area is the subject of the upcoming film The Apprentice, which stars MCU actor Sebastian Stan as Donald Trump. Following the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Trump's lawyers have sent a cease and desist letter to block The Apprentice's release.\n\nRelated Hollywood - and Donald Trump - Reacts to Joe Biden's Shock Election Withdrawal\n\nAs Joe Biden announced He will not seek reelection as President, Hollywood stars such as Mark Hamill and Jamie Lee Curtis shared their thoughts online\n\nAniston calling out Vance's comments points to the many errors in his statement. For one, Harris is the stepmother to her husband's two children, while Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten Glezman Buttigieg, adopted twins. However, there is certainly a strong argument that whether they have children or not, the fact is irrelevant when it comes to running the country or making their own voices heard.\n\nThe Republican Party is still backing Vance, who most people might know best as the subject of the critically panned Netflix film Hillbilly Elegy, as the VP nomination. While Kamala Harris is expected to be announced as the Democratic Party nominee for President, the question now falls on who she will back as her VP nomination to go up against Vance in the Vice Presidential debates.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

This is probably pretty shocking to someone like him who is used to failing upwards with the money of a neo-nazi sympathizer backing them. Oh well, I guess no one can be good at everything, right?\n\nSo here's the deal, Vance's comments about Harris, which he made in 2021 and 2022, have come back to bite him in the butt because they're dumb, verbally lazy, and frankly uninspiring. In 2021, the finance bro-turned-politician (a surprisingly active pipeline even if we all wished it weren't) railed against the \"childless left\" who want to make policies for the future despite not having children. Vance's broligarchy opinion is that a lack of children somehow makes a person have less of a stake in the future of America.\n\nVance doubled down on this speaking to Tucker Carlson, a man who frequently comes across as irrationally angry at how horny the Green M&M makes him, later in 2022:\n\nVance told Carlson: \"We're effectively run in this country -- via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs -- by a bunch of childless cat ladies, who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. It's just a basic fact.\n\n\"If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nLook, we could make ourselves angry at step-parent erasure, which Harris has been since 2014, but I would much rather just point and laugh at how deeply stupid these men are and how small their lives must be. Vance is simply telling on himself. Poorly, I might add. He's got the charisma of Kevin Sorbo-Scott Baio's direct-to-streaming cop buddy movie with a high approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is to say, it's nonexistent. So what's a fella to do when he simply lacks in everything but white male privilege? Attack anyone who's not like him!\n\nNow, let's get something out of the way: I am a childless cat lady. I think cats are awesome. Jeff, the cat, is currently sleeping right next to me, oblivious that somewhere out there a weirdo from Ohio thinks he has more of a right in the say of the future of America than I do because he had some kids. (Not that he actually cares about protecting kids via his policies, of course. He has proven time and again that he'll choose guns over kids when given the opportunity.)\n\nI really enjoy that Vance is so myopic in his own worldview that the thought would never cross his mind that some people want to make the world a better place for everyone else because it's the right and kind thing to do. It's especially hilarious that he thought it prudent to take his rant to Tucker Carlson of all people. That's all a guy like him can do: Rant. Why? He's absolutely atrocious at public speaking and has the stage presence of a cardboard cutout of a tree. Just look at him!\n\nAll I can say is: Yikes. Stick to making the world a more terrible place behind the scenes, buddy. This is simply not your forte. Jeff, the cat, could have worked the crowd better, my man!\n\nHere are some facts. Vance's top donor for his Senate campaign was Peter Theil, who gave him 15 million dollars. The most anyone has ever given to a candidate in a Senate election. It must be nice to have your own Daddy Warbucks to throw ungodly sums of cash at you when you decide it's time to stop writing exploitative memoirs about your family and get into the political grift, sorry, the life of public service.\n\nYou know who has led a life of public service? Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. Also, not for nothing, but some moderate Googling indicates that Madam Vice President doesn't actually have any pets.\n\nYou know who does have cats and is childless, though?\n\nHell hath no fury like a Swiftie scorned, bro. Go cry about it to your billionaire donor. The rest of us will pet our cats and enjoy our lives, while thinking of how we can make the future a better world ... for your children, I guess.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_hudson@themarysue.com", "name": "Kate Hudson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Male privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct-to-video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oligarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JD-Vance-Smudge-Cat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Jennifer Aniston condemned the Republican VP nominee for his remark calling women, like Kamala Harris, who haven't given birth \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" and \"have no direct stake in America.\" In an Instagram Story posted on Wednesday, July 24, Aniston reposted a screenshot of a tweet quoting the 2021 Fox News interview with host Tucker Carlson where Vance said the comments in question, then-a canidate for the Ohio senate.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" an incredulous Aniston captioned the post. \"All I can say is ... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\"\n\nThe Friends actor, who has been outspoken about her fertility issues in the past, criticized Vance for even speaking on fertility issues when his own policies would obliterate access to sexual and reproductive health, including abortion and protections for in virto fertilization. \"I hope [your daughter] will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,\" she wrote. \"Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" Looks like Vance's likeability numbers aren't going up anytime soon.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_guy@vulture.com", "name": "Zoe Guy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

A handful have also never produced any offspring.\n\nChief among them was George Washington, America's first president who like Harris helped raise his spouse's children from a previous marriage.\n\nMeghan McCain, daughter of late Republican senator John McCain, warned that Vance's comments \"are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends.\"\n\nThe focus on politicians' children comes as reproductive health and abortion access topics Harris has championed take center stage in this year's election.\n\n\"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married,\" venture capitalist and Trump-endorsed former congressional candidate Blake Masters wrote on X.\n\n\"If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations?\" he said.\n\nIn a 2021 speech, Vance went so far as to suggest people with children should have more votes.\n\n\"When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power,\" he said in quotes unearthed by the Washington Post, adding \"if you don't have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice.\"\n\nVance's campaign has since dismissed the comments as a \"thought experiment.\"\n\nbur-bfm/mlm", "source":

On Wednesday's (July 24) edition of The View, the cohosts pointed to the newly-minted billionaire entertainer as an example of a so-called \"cat lady\" in response to resurfaced comments vice presidential candidate JD Vance once made about now-presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nIn the clip, from 2021, Vance appeared on Fox News in support of his senate campaign and said, 'We're effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and choices that they've made, so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\" He then went on to name Harris (along with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) as examples before adding, \"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a stake in it?\"\n\nVance's comments drew sharp criticism from the cohosts, with Alyssa Farah Griffin saying, \"How dare you come for cat ladies? The cover of Time Magazine is Taylor Swift, the ultimate fabulous cat lady. What are you doing?!\"\n\nElsewhere, Sara Haines argued that, even as a mother, she disagreed with Vance's sentiment, saying, \"I have children, and I assure you that's not my first thought when I think about politics. My kids are gonna obviously be affected by that, but anyone with a heart will look at the moral clarity of the decisions we're making here.\"\n\nShe went on to mention sustained attacks on reproductive rights across the country and said, \"I care about all the women that are dealing with that. That's not my body right now. I've done some stuff.\"\n\nThe subject came up once again when Hostin interviewed the day's guest, Representative Adam Schiff, and he called the comments, \"I think we have just scratched the surface of how low they're going to go. Those comments by JD Vance are disgraceful and just plain stupid.\"", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_bell@tvinsider.com", "name": "Amanda Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Farah_Griffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Farah Griffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Haines", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sara Haines"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-View-4-1014x570.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 235, "textEnd": 242}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Most women relate to this.\"\n\nAnother questioned, \"Just because you CAN HAVE children, doesn't mean you SHOULD,\" leading someone to flip it and ask, \"That logic works both ways. You could just as easily say if more people made the decision to have children, we might life [sic] in a better world.\"\n\n\"Yes, because supporting families is just such a weird thing. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23,\" wrote one person in support of Vance's statement, leading another to reply, \"Its not supporting families. Its [sic] saying women are only valued for their ovaries.\"\n\nOther celebrities and well-known figures have also commented on Vance's statements, with Meghan McCain writing, \"These JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends. These comments have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are.\"\n\nThe comments continue to make waves as the debate goes on, with many more jumping in to share their thoughts on the topic.\n\nNext: Jennifer Aniston Shares \"Big News\" With Fans in Exciting New Announcement", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devon_forward@postandcourier.com", "name": "Devon Forward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Maybe you've lived in fear of it. Or maybe you are one, and don't know why people treat it like it's a bad thing.\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance referred to Vice President (and current frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination) Kamala Harris as one of them. He spoke with Tucker Carlson on Fox News in July 2021, when Vance was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country ... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Vance told Carlson. \"It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\" Harris has two stepchildren with her husband, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.\n\nJennifer Aniston, who doesn't have children, called out Vance on her Instagram story: \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" And many Swifties pounced at Vance's resurfaced comments, willing to defend Taylor Swift's honor as a mother of only cats.\n\nWhere did this term come from, exactly, and why do we rarely hear a man described as childless in this same manner? Chalk it up to \"straight-up sexism and heterosexism.\"\n\n\"Women often are likened to cats in a pejorative way -- for example, a common insult is to call a woman 'catty,' says Leora Tanenbaum, author of \"I Am Not a Slut: Slut-Shaming in the Age of the Internet.\" \"With a man, on the other hand, you would never use that word and are more likely to describe him as 'spiteful.' And we describe arguments between women as 'catfights,' while an argument between men is just, well, an 'argument.'\"\n\nWomen have long been treated differently in society.\n\n\"The expectation that all women will and should become mothers was forged by a long history that understood reproduction as American women's primary civic contribution,\" says Peggy Heffington, an assistant senior instructional professor at the University of Chicago who teaches and writes on feminism, women's movements and motherhood in American and European history.\n\nThey couldn't vote, couldn't own property, couldn't open a credit card. Just because these institutions shifted doesn't mean more ephemeral expectations did.\n\n\"The 'cat lady' stereotype is an extension of dominant beliefs about what femininity should look like,\" adds Tanenbaum. \"If a woman is unmarried or childless, she goes against expectations for her gender role, which is to be partnered with a man and devote herself to her biological family. It's OK if she works, but not if she's too ambitious and puts her career above her family.\"\n\nUnmarried or childless men don't get the same treatment. A single man is referred to as a \"bachelor\" and his living arrangements an enviable \"bachelor pad.\" That's because a childless male \"isn't violating gender norms. This is sexism in action.\"\n\nPlus, harping on women's lack of children sends a dangerous message to those unable to have them, as Aniston noted. \"For women who are unable to bear children due to medical complications, this increases their sense of guilt and worthlessness,\" says psychologist Rene\u00e9 Carr. \"Or, if a woman simply chooses to not have children and to focus on her career instead, it adds an extreme amount of undue pressure and makes her more likely to experience depression or have lower life mortality.\"\n\nSome of the judgment may even be coming from other women, according to Maryanne Fisher, a psychology professor at St. Mary's University in Canada, who is researching how married women plus those in committed relationships see single women. \"Signs indicate that it is even more of an issue if the single woman is considered attractive. They don't need to know the single women, they merely need to see an image to feel threatened, as though their romantic relationship could be in danger.\"\n\nMore details: Jennifer Aniston hits back at JD Vance's viral 'childless cat ladies' comments\n\nThe \"cat lady\" insult specifically carries with it some connotations. \"You are physically unattractive, or a workaholic, which makes you a deviant person; no wonder you have a pet cat, because that's the only one who loves you,\" Tanenbaum says. Tell that to all the Swifties who bought tickets to her groundbreaking Eras tour and firing up social media retorts to Vance's comments.\n\n\"I have loved the memes that people have been coming back with in response. It's telling me that folks in this campaign are feeling a lot of joy and promise,\" says Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund. \"They're letting the cruelty of those sorts of remarks roll off and responding with a lot of joy reminding people that there's nothing wrong with cats and there's nothing wrong with women.\"\n\nStill, it's no joke for impressionable kids. \"These type of messages tell young girls, to limit your aspirations to only being a wife and a mother,\" Carr says. \"For females who desire other types of success, these messages clearly communicate that, 'despite your achievements and sacrifices for your career, none of that matters because you are not a mother.'\"\n\nAnd more here too: Internet warns JD Vance after video resurfaces implying Kamala Harris is childless cat lady\n\nThe truth? \"Whether a woman chose not to have a child, or a couple encountered a fertility issue, it's not our business,\" says Amy Morin, psychotherapist, author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do\" and the host of a podcast.\n\nShe suggests people combat this thinking in society by addressing gender stereotypes head on. \"Pointing out inappropriate comments and phrases can raise awareness about how these beliefs affect not just women, but also younger people. We don't want children growing up to believe that girls have to become moms in order to matter to society.\"\n\nTime will tell if Vance will further meow-th off about all this.

Democrats are energized. Their chances look significantly better with Vice President Kamala Harris (likely) taking up the party's nomination. There is hope. Still, the threat of Donald Trump has not gone away. There is still a chance he could be re-elected and plunge the country into one of Christo fascism. However, his Diet Mountain Dew-swilling (not racist, just lame), couch-f***ing running mate may screw that up for him.\n\nJD Vance will (likely) go down as one of the worst picks for Vice President in U.S. history. He has negative charisma and is already embarrassing himself at campaign rallies. His qualifications are laughable. The man is a weirdo hack of an author who may as well have \"opportunistic\" tattooed on his forehead. People have already unearthed embarrassing past comments from the Hillybilly Elegy author, including a shot at women who have decided not to have children.\n\nThe United States is run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Vance told Tucker Carlson in 2022. If you think that is a wildly sexist and s****y thing to say, you are correct! Misogyny is the main thing the GOP has to go on since they collectively decided against making any further \"race comments\" (like that'll work). Jennifer Aniston ain't having it.\n\nAniston took to her Instagram to read Vance for the filth that he is. \"All I can say is ... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" she wrote on her account. The actress is someone who has struggled with IVF in the past and clearly doesn't mind putting Vance in his place, saying, \"We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child.\"\n\nShe didn't stop there. The Friends actor invoked Vance's two-year-old daughter, as she wrote, \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" The GOP is spiraling, trying to figure out how to counter the excitement on display by the Democratic party.

Vance has three children with his Indian-American wife Usha Chilukuri, and he often advances the view that childless adults have no stake in the future of America.\n\nThe putdown, rekindled in the election season, has ignited strong reaction from women, including celebrities, many of whom already see the Trump-Vance ticket and MAGA Republicans as sexist and misogynistic, with a patriarchal outlook that curtails women's rights.\n\nAmong others, the actress Jennifer Aniston said on a social media platform that she can't believe such a statement is coming from a potential VP of the United States. \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF (in vitro fertilization) as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,\" Aniston said, referring to efforts on part of conservative Republican men to legislate and control reproductive rights of women.\n\nFemale cat owners filled social media with #childlesscatlady hashtags and memes, some of them posting photos of Taylor Swift, a powerful cultural icon, posing with a cat for a magazine cover. \"Hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate,\" read one tweet that has been viewed more than 1 million times.\n\nAlthough single till she was almost 50, Kamala Harris nurtured the children of her sister Maya Harris, who was a single mom. Following her marriage to Doug Emhoff, Kamala became a step-mom to his two children, Ella and Cole, who call her \"momala.\"\n\nRemarkably, in a further smackdown of the Trump-Vance outlook, Emhoff's ex-wife came out swinging for Kamala, saying she has been a \"loving, nurturing, fiercely protective and always present,\" co-parent to the children and \"I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, female reproductive rights, also referred to as the abortion issue, already a hot button subject, has become even more potent after Kamala Harris moved up as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nTrump himself attacked Harris on the abortion issue at an election rally on Wednesday, falsely misrepresenting her views, as he did with Hillary Clinton in 2016. \"She wants abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy. That's fine with her, right up until birth and even after birth, the execution of a baby,\" he said.\n\nLate term abortions are very rare and happen under exceptional circumstances such as severe fetal anomalies, but Trump, MAGA Republicans, and ultraconservatives often talk of \"babies being ripped out of the womb\" in an effort to demonize Democrats.", "source": {"uri":

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Vice President Kamala Harris, adding that voters have \"turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it.\"\n\nGoldberg reacted to the resurfaced interview by addressing Vance directly -- noting, \"You never had a baby! So you know nothing about this!\"\n\n\"Sir, there are people who have chosen not to have children for whatever reason. There are people who want to have children who cannot,\" Goldberg responded.\n\nShe added, \"How dare you! You never had a baby. Your wife had a baby, but you never had a baby. So you know nothing about this. And how dare you! And women, you heard how he thinks of you. Yeah. This is not good for you, JD!\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump recently selected Vance to be his vice presidential nominee in order to shore up support amongst voters in key states in the Midwest.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whoopi Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-View-8_04_38-am-2024-07-24.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Videos have emerged of JD Vance saying he feels that people without child have less stake in the future and so they should not have the same voting rights as the people with children etc.He called Kamala Harris, AOC and Pete Buttigieg 'childless cat ladies' who are running the country.\n\nJournalist David Weigel recounted speaking to JD Vance when he spouted something similar like 'childless cat ladies' and explained it. David wrote in Semafor that in 2022 JD Vance gave a Covid example for what he advocates. He at that time said that left policies are harmful to kids as left politicians are mostly childless.\n\nChildless policymakers favored school mask mandated during the Covid-19 pandemic, the anti-mask senator said. \"When you have children, and you've interacted with children regularly, I think you realize how many of the left policies are really harmful to kids,\" he said. \"That was the most egregious example.\"\n\nJD Vance drew flak for calling Kamala Harris and other Democratic leaders as 'childless cat ladies' while his target was not the Democrat leaders but childless people -- as a whole. \"Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" JD Vance said in the old controversial video.\n\nIn another video, he said parents should get more voting rights than childless people as they have much investment in the future. \"Let's give votes to all children in this country. But let's give control over those votes to the parents of those children. (Claps from audience). When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don't have kids. Let's face the consequences in the reality. If you don't have as much of an investment in the future of the country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice,\" Vance said in another controversial clip.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Vance's comments about childless women", "body": "Jennifer Aniston defended Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday after Senator J.D. Vance called her a \"childless cat lady\" in a resurfaced interview on Fox News.\n\nJennifer took to her Instagram story to condemn the senator's words, reposting the video of Vance appearing on the media outlet in 2021 and writing, \"I truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States\".\n\nThe Ohio senator was officially named as Donald Trump's running mate on July 15 and has ruffled feathers for his conservative rhetoric ahead of the US elections in November.\n\nJennifer continued on her story, \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nIn the interview, Vance also criticized the Vice President's fellow Democrats, Pete Buttigieg and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, claiming they were \"miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nHe continued, \"It's just a basic fact...the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nWhile Kamala Harris does not have children, she has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella, from husband Douglas Emhoff, whom she married in 2014. He was given the title of second gentleman of the United States when she became Vice President in 2021.\n\nJennifer herself has been vocal about her fertility struggles in the past; she wrote an article for The Huffington Post in 2016 about how important it is for women to make their own decisions when it comes to having children, and criticized the public's interest in her own fertility issues.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic,\" she wrote at the time. \"We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples...we don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own happily ever after for ourselves.\"\n\nThe 55-year-old also opened up to Allure in 2022, revealing that the constant public speculation around her fertility took a toll.\n\n\"It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" she said. \"All the years and years and years of speculation...it was really hard.\"\n\n\"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nNow that the Friends actress cannot have kids, she explained that the thought brings her nothing but relief.\n\n\"I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more \"Can I?\" I don't have to think about that anymore.\"", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance for 'Childless Cat Lady' Comment", "body": "Gabby Petito's Texts Show 'More and More Tension' With Brian Laundrie\n\nJennifer Aniston slammed vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance for his viral comments about \"childless\" women after she previously opened up about her struggles with infertility.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" the Friends alum, 55, wrote on her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, July 24, alongside a screenshot of a tweet about J.D.'s statement, in which he criticized women without children holding positions of power in the government.\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Jennifer continued. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her too.\"\n\nThe actress was responding to a viral interview from 2021 between J.D., 39, and then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n\"We're effectively run in this country -- via the democrats, via our corporate oligarchs -- by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Donald Trump's running mate said. \"And it's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nJennifer got candid about her struggles with infertility in a 2022 cover story for Allure.\n\n\"It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\" The Morning Show star said. \"My late 30s, 40s, I'd gone through really hard shit, and if it wasn't for going through that, I would've never become who I was meant to be. I was trying to get pregnant.\"\n\nJennifer revealed at the time that she had spent years trying everything from \"drinking Chinese teas\" to going through the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process.\n\n\"I was throwing everything at it,\" she continued. \"I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\nJennifer admitted that it was painful seeing the narratives that she didn't have a child because she \"just cared\" about her career or that her marriages to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux ended because she \"wouldn't give\" them children. However, as she entered her 50s, she had \"zero regrets.\"\n\n\"I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.' I don't have to think about that anymore,\" she said.\n\nFollowing years of speculation over whether or not she was pregnant, Jennifer penned an essay for HuffPost in 2016 to set the record straight.\n\n\"The sheer amount of resources being spent right now by press trying to simply uncover whether or not I am pregnant (for the bajillionth time ... but who's counting) points to the perpetuation of this notion that women are somehow incomplete, unsuccessful, or unhappy if they're not married with children,\" she wrote, later adding, \"Here's where I come out on this topic: we are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone.\"", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elise_nelson@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Elise Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Now another clip has emerged on social media highlighting JD Vance's stand on childless people.\n\nIn the new video, JD Vance can be seen laying out his belief that voters with child/children and voters without child are not the same.\n\n\"Let's give votes to all children in this country. But let's give control over those votes to the parents of those children. (Claps from audience). When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don't have kids. Let's face the consequences in the reality. If you don't have as much of an investment in the future of the country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice,\" Vance said in the controversial clip.\n\nSimply put, Vance said childless people should not have the same power of voting as parents. But as he couldn't probably advocate for taking voting rights away from childless people, he said parents should get double voting rights -- theirs and their children's as well.\n\n'Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC'\n\nJD Vance harbors scorn for childless people including those who do not have their own biological child. Because both Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg were parents when Vance took the 'childless cat ladies' jibe at them.\n\n\"Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" JD Vance said.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

How old he would be in four years, there's a good chance JD Vance would be president of the United States.\"\n\nRyan continued, \"So you tell all the people who own cats and the women who don't have children, and all the people with stepchildren, that JD Vance could potentially be the next president of the United States, you're going to see a huge backlash. And I think -- not to be glib about this -- but when you look at the Republican Party, you look at the evangelicals -- Jesus did not have children. Right?

Mark Kelly raised questions about the fitness for office of Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance for once describing Democrats as \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nKelly, D-Ariz., who is under consideration for the Democrats' vice-presidential nomination, hit Vance, R-Ohio, for his 2021 comment and expanded it to another Vance remark involving abortion rights.\n\nFor Kelly, it was another opportunity to showcase the kind of attack-dog presence that is usually expected of vice-presidential candidates while he remains a possibility.\n\n\"It's utterly ridiculous and obnoxious and wrong. What I really worry about is what he would do being one heartbeat away from the presidency,\" Kelly told reporters outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I mean, here's a guy who when he's talking about women who have been raped or who are pregnant because of incest that two wrongs don't make a right,\" Kelly said. \"What is wrong about a woman who has been raped ... to be able to terminate a pregnancy? What's wrong with that? I have two daughters and a granddaughter. I really worry about their rights if Donald Trump is elected again, and JD Vance is the vice president.\"\n\nVance is getting new scrutiny for a 2021 comment he made on Fox News bemoaning life under Democrats using a sexist trope.\n\nJD Vance in Arizona: Here's when the GOP vice presidential nominee will campaign in Arizona\n\n\"We're effectively run in this country -- via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs -- by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance said then.\n\nHe went on to name-check several prominent Democrats.\n\n\"You look at Kamala Harris, (Transportation Secretary) Pete Buttigieg, (U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.). The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children, and how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nHarris is the stepmother to her husband's two adult children.\n\nVance's remark, made when he was running for the Senate, has sparked new pushback from the left and found support from an old Kelly rival, Blake Masters, whom Kelly defeated in Arizona's 2022 Senate race.\n\nIn a social media post Wednesday, Masters, who is running for Congress with Vance's endorsement, wrote: \"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married. If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations? Skin in the game matters.\"\n\nIt is part of a series of comments and ads that Masters has used against one of his chief political opponents, Abe Hamadeh, who is unmarried and doesn't have any children. Hamadeh has instead emphasized his military experience, a contrast with Masters, who did not serve.\n\nActress Jennifer Aniston, whose struggle with fertility issues has been well-publicized, is among those who have criticized Vance for the remark and invoked in-vitro fertilization, another subject where Democrats have accused Republicans of wanting to roll back rights.\n\n\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States,\" she wrote in a social media post. \"Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nKelly and his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., detailed their own efforts to use IVF to help have children until she was shot in the head in 2011 near Tucson.\n\nMeghan McCain lamented the harm Republicans are doing to their own elective prospects with remarks such as Vance's.\n\n\"I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know -- these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends,\" she wrote in a social media post Thursday. \"These comments have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian.

Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nIn her post, the Friends alum also shared a screenshot of a tweet, which featured Vance's July 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. In the clip, Donald Trump's running mate can be heard saying the United States was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance continued in the footage. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nHarris is a stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children, Cole, 29, and Ella, 25. Vance and his wife Usha share three children, Ewan, 6, Vivek, 4, and Mirabel, 2.\n\nAniston's comments come a week after Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, picked Vance as his vice president at the Republican National Convention ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nThe Emmy-winning actress has previously addressed the false pregnancy rumors that she's dealt with throughout her entire Hollywood career. She told Allure in 2022 that it was \"really hard\" to see the fake reports.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard,\" Aniston said at the time. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would have given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it.\"\n\nBefore that, she wrote an essay for the Huffington Post in 2016 about how completely \"fed up\" she was with the ongoing pregnancy speculations.\n\n\"Here's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone,\" the Murder Mystery 2 actress wrote. \"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.

Vance doesn't believe in one person, one vote", "body": "Vance wants to give parents more votes than people without children and has been hostile to those without kids as part of his worldview that involves using the power of the government to promote higher birth rates.\n\nJ.D. Vance could soon be a heartbeat away from the presidency as 78-year-old Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, which means he's getting a lot more scrutiny over his views, policy ideas, and past speeches and statements.\n\nOne of the most controversial of those statements is Vance's repudiation of one of the very principles of American democracy: one person, one vote. Put simply, this is the idea of equal representation -- that any one person's voting power should be the same as any other person's.\n\nVance, however, believes that people with children should have significantly greater power when they go to the ballot box. During a 2021 speech at an event hosted by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, a group that promotes conservative thought on college campuses, Vance proposed giving children the ability to vote, but only if their parents controlled those votes.\n\n\"Let's give votes to all children in this country, but let's give control over those votes to the parents of those children,\" Vance said. \"When you go to the polls in this country, as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don't have kids.\"\n\n\"Let's face the consequences and the reality. If you don't have as much as an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice,\" he continued.\n\nIn response to reporting on Vance's statement and footage of his speech going viral this week, Trump 2024 National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Vance's words \"are being taken out of context\" and that he was being \"unfairly attacked.\"\n\nShe pointed to a part of Vance's speech where he discussed how he wasn't focusing on people who were \"unable to have kids for very complicated and important reasons\" or those who can't have children for biological or medical reasons.\n\n\"The target of these remarks is not them,\" Vance said.\n\nWhat went unchallenged by the Trump campaign is that Vance believes some people's votes should count more than others.\n\nWhile Vance's idea would almost certainly be impossible to implement and of questionable legality, it fits in with his worldview of wanting to use the power of the US government to promote higher birth rates -- so much so that he can't help but be hostile to people who decide not to have kids.\n\nIn his speech, Vance argued that conservatives had lost power over the nation's cultural institutions and needed to encourage families to have more kids to avert a \"civilizational crisis.\"\n\nHe also attacked Vice President Kamala Harris for being childless, even though she has two step-children -- suggesting he doesn't believe step-children count as children. During his 2021 speech, Vance criticized Harris and three fellow Democrats -- Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- for not having kids, and suggested it should disqualify them from being elected leaders.\n\n\"What is the one thing that unites every single one of them?\" Vance said. \"Not a single one of them has any children. Now why is that? Why have we let the Democrat Party become controlled by people who don't have any children?\"\n\nVance has repeated that attack line in other interviews and speeches in recent years.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Vance told Fox News during his campaign for US Senate in Ohio.\n\n\"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" Vance said.\n\nButtigieg, notably, has since adopted fraternal twins with his husband. But these \"cat ladies,\" Vance has said, have no \"direct stake\" in America's future and \"hate normal Americans for choosing family over these ridiculous D.C. and New York status games.\"\n\nVance's obsession with people having children and boosting birthrates branches out in strange directions, too. In 2020, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"daylight savings time reduces fertility by at least 10 percent.\"\n\nAs part of his effort to encourage more families to have kids, Vance has also implied that it should be harder to get divorced. While speaking at Pacifica Christian High School in California in 2021, Vance spoke of his grandparents who raised him, applauding the fact that they never separated, even though they had an \"incredibly chaotic marriage.\" He even suggested that people in \"violent\" marriages should try to work things out.\n\nAt multiple forums in 2021, Vance also touted a program in Hungary that awards loans to couples who get married before the bride's 41st birthday -- with a third of the loans becoming forgivable if the couple goes on to have two children, and the whole debt wiped out if they have three. Vance has said that the US should consider implementing a similar program, and has endorsed modest plans to support married families who have children and stay-at-home parents.\n\nNotably, however, he opposes efforts to pass a national childcare program to help address the nation's long-simmering childcare crisis -- a reason why some Americans forego children.\n\n\"'Universal day care' is class war against normal people,\" Vance wrote on X in 2021, arguing that it was a \"massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class.\"\n\nVance, however, may be projecting his own views onto those voters. Polls have consistently shown that an overwhelming majority of Americans want the government and candidates for elected office to do more to help them afford childcare and expand access to childcare.\n\nVoters also appear to loathe Vance's remarks about \"childless cat ladies\" making the rest of the country miserable. A recent Data for Progress poll found that 56% of Americans disagree with Vance's statement, while only 30% agree.\n\nIt's unclear, however, where voters stand on giving people with kids more votes or whether daylight savings time reduces fertility -- the ideas are so outlandish they've never been polled, as far as we can tell.", "source": {"uri": "iowastartingline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iowa Starting Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keya_vakil@iowastartingline.com", "name": "Keya Vakil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intercollegiate Studies Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

She's not alone.", "body": "Some Republican are claiming Kamala Harris is not \"fit\" to lead the country because she is not a biological mom. The backlash has been swift.\n\nJennifer Aniston, Kamala Harris and women across America are getting increasingly sick of the GOP's bizarre, misogynistic insults.\n\nIn the aftermath of President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, Democrats have quickly united behind his vice president. In one day, Harris raised a record-breaking $81 million, and more than 28,000 people signed up to volunteer for her campaign. By Monday evening she had secured enough delegates to become the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\nAcross the aisle, the Republican Party is scrambling to pivot a presidential campaign that was focused heavily on Biden and his age. Republican nominee Donald Trump (and his team) have spent a lot of time on social media platform Truth Social trying out numerous \"names\" for and various attacks against his likely opponent, including \"Lying' Kamala.\" Conservatives have argued Harris' laugh \"turns off voters,\" claimed \"people don't view her as Black,\" thrown around labels like the \"DEI\" candidate, and have threatened erroneous legal action to keep Harris off the November ballot.\n\nBut one of the more ridiculous attacks to emerge against Harris is the claim that she is not \"fit\" to lead the country because she's not a biological mom. In a recently resurfaced clip of then-Senate candidate JD Vance speaking to Tucker Carlson in 2022, Trump's newly minted 2024 running mate calls Harris a \"childless cat lady\" who, like other child-free women, are miserable at their own lives and the choices they have made, so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\" Vance also argued, as have other conservatives, that in order to have a vested interest in America and its future, you have to give birth -- a stance that is equal parts insulting and hilariously false.\n\nVance's comments have gone understandably viral, with Jennifer Aniston weighing in Wednesday on social media. \"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\" Aniston has had to deal throughout her entire career with speculation about why she does not have children. In 2022, the \"Friends\" icon told Allure that she had tried IVF, unsuccessfully. Vance voted against a Senate bill that would have protected IVF.\n\nAniston's response highlighted the hypocrisy of Vance's comments. But they are also cruel. To be clear, Harris is herself the proud mom to two stepchildren -- Ella and Cole Emhoff -- and has been since she married their father, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, in 2014. Like the 4 in 10 Americans who have at least one step-relative in their family, Harris and her blended family know there are a myriad ways to create, and love, a family -- a vaginal or C-section birth is not a requirement.\n\nConservative pundit Will Chamberlain disagrees.\n\n\"Really simple, underdiscussed reason why Kamala Harris shouldn't be President. No Children,\" Chamberlain posted on X. \"And no, becoming a step-parent to older teenagers doesn't count. The concerns of parents and families will always be abstract to her.\"\n\nChamberlain went on to say that he wants \"a president with skin in the game, a stake in the future, and the lived experience of raising children.\"\n\nChamberlain and Vance seem to be on the same page. \"You have Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance said in his 2022 Carlson interview, ignoring the fact that, like Harris, Buttigieg has two children. \"How does that make any sense when we've turned our country over to people who don't have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nFar-right political activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer -- whom Trump has embraced -- also made the same argument this week, while simultaneously accusing Harris of terminating past pregnancies (Harris has never said she had an abortion) and pushing the lie that having an abortion causes infertility (it does not, abortion is 14 times safer than childbirth).\n\nJust like with small children throwing tantrums, I understand why some people may think it's best just to ignore such baseless, asinine attacks. And yet we've all seen the damage that can be done when extreme rhetoric goes unchecked.\n\nThe truth is, fear and concern for the future is one of the many reasons why people are now deciding to prolong or avoid having children altogether. In 2023, 13 studies conducted between 2012 and 2022 involving over 10,000 participants in numerous countries, found that climate change concerns are associated with \"less positive attitudes towards reproduction and a desire or intent for fewer children or none at all.\"\n\nMeanwhile, child-free politicians are among the many leaders working hard to make the future better for the next generation of Americans. They have helped spearhead efforts to help reduce the maternal mortality crisis, expand the child tax credit and universal free lunch, and policies that protect immigrant families.\n\nHere's another data point for Vance and co. In 2020, half of all eligible youth voted in the presidential election -- an 11-point increase from the previous election in 2016. Did all of these young people have children? Certainly not. And yet they showed up to the polls. Because obviously, a lack of biological offspring does not determine your level of investment in America.\n\nPerhaps this logic makes sense for a political party that prioritizes vengeance, victimhood and selfishness over equality.\n\nOr maybe this is just another example of Republicans grasping at straws after being out-politicked by an 81-year-old man who (eventually) put party, country and democracy over his ego.\n\nEither way, we can be sure Harris will face an onslaught of racist and sexist attacks between now and November, all designed to undermine her as a person, a politician and a parent. But like so many of her fellow moms, the de facto Democratic nominee for president knows how to ignore these childlike tantrums -- all the way to the White House.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com",

One particular line of attack - relating to the fact that Harris has never birthed a child - was both depressingly predictable and recycled from several years ago. Comments made in 2021 by JD Vance, claiming the party is run \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too\", went viral once again. People without children don't have a direct stake in the country, he went on to say, suggesting they shouldn't be in charge.\n\nThe clip has prompted much discourse on both sides, and memes declaring \"Cat ladies for Kamala\" have been the amusing result. As we know, the internet loves a cat. Suggesting that not having given birth renders a candidate unfit to govern the United States is, of course, an absurdity when you consider how no American president in history has ever borne and birthed a child. However, Kamala is a woman, and a woman who is in the running to govern an increasingly pronatalist nation in which women's reproductive rights are dramatically curtailed.\n\nIn this context, the cat lady attacks are entirely in line with the Republican party's ideal of woman as mother and homemaker; a \"trad wife\" who does not work outside the home and whose focus is serving her husband and caring for children, not to mention perpetuating the dominance of the white race. Kamala's refutation of that stereotype as a \"childless\", educated mixed-race woman who has risen to the top of her profession and politics is seen by the right as a fundamental threat to those ideas.\n\nSo how to attack her? Invoking the pitiable stereotype of the miserable, reproductively thwarted, lonely, mad cat woman is one way to go about it. And it doesn't even have to make sense. Harris is married and has two step-children that call her \"Mamala\" and with whom she has a loving relationship. We don't even know whether she owns a cat. Not that it matters. Unless she has physically given birth - the overriding purpose of all women in the rightwing evangelical Christian mindset - then she is not fulfilling her feminine destiny, and is unfit to govern. (Of course, if she did have a gaggle of children and was running for president, those same voices would be framing her as a neglectful mother.)\n\nIt's amusing and disturbing to see the crazy cat lady stereotype invoked in this day and age, and it didn't just emerge in 2021. It may have become a popular meme in recent years, beloved by those incels and online misogynists on the frontline of the feminist backlash, but as an idea it has a long, long history. In the same year as JD Vance made his comments, I published a memoir, The Year of the Cat, which explores how I adopted Mackerel, a kitten, at a time when I was trying to make the \"mother of all decisions\" - whether or not to have a baby - interwoven with the history of the stereotype of childless, or child-free, women as crazy cat ladies. In fact, the book's working title for a long time was \"Crazy Cat Lady\".", "source": {"uri": "vogue.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiracial people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_lady", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat lady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feminism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/66a0e5ebd36b6726b80bea27/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2162559863.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

You don't have to be genetically related to your children to be a \"real\" parent.\n\nVice presidential candidate JD Vance seems to think differently. He spoke of Vice President Kamala Harris in an interview with Tucker Carlson in 2021 that was republished online earlier this week. It has racked up over 28 million views on X alone.\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country ... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" Vance said to Carlson. \"It's just a basic fact.\" People like Kamala Harris, he said, have \"no direct stake\" in America.\n\nThose of us with children not genetically related to us would like a word. So would cat lovers.\n\nVice President Harris actually is a mother -- a stepmother, or \"bonus mother,\" if you prefer, to two children: Ella and Cole Emhoff. They call her \"Momala.\" When Ella graduated from college in 2021, Harris was there. When Cole was married in October, Harris officiated.\n\nElla, now 25, took to social media to defend her stepmom, saying \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?\" She told her biological mother, Kerstin Emhoff, \"Say it louder for the people in the back.\"\n\nKerstin Emhoff, ex-wife of Doug Emhoff, the current second gentleman, provided statements to news outlets saying, \"These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nAccording to the latest research on Smart Stepfamilies, between 29 and 30 million stepparents exist in the U.S. today, parenting over 11 million children. If you take all \"steprelationships\" -- parent, sibling or child -- there are more than 113 million Americans with those relationships. There are an estimated additional 5 to 7 million people who have been adopted, like most of my children.\n\nThat's a lot of people without genetic ties to their families.\n\nYou also don't have to birth children to be eligible to be president of the United States. To date, no presidents have ever given birth. Additionally, five U.S. presidents did not have biological children: George Washington, James Polk, James Madison, James Buchanan and Andrew Jackson. Our first president, Washington, had no biological children, but, like Harris, was the stepparent to two children, and Andrew Jackson had one adopted child.\n\nVance continued with the Tucker Carlson interview, saying, \"If we want a healthy ruling class in this country, we should invest more, we should vote more, we should support more people who actually have kids. ... I mean, these people recognize that they're unhappy. They're living in one-bedroom apartments in New York City. They've played their entire lives to win a status game. They're obsessed with their jobs,\" he claimed, saying that they \"hate normal Americans for choosing family.\"\n\nHis comments are causing hurt and backlash in online communities. Meghan McCain, a conservative former host on \"The View,\" had several posts on X about the controversial comments. \"One of my best friends did rounds and rounds of unsuccessful IVF wanting to have a child. It is still painful to talk about. This 'childless women' comment by JD Vance has made so many waves with so many different friends of mine for it's insensitivity and cruelty to women,\" read one post.\n\nAnother read: \"I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know - these JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends. These comments have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are.\"\n\nThe cat-lover crowd is motivated too, with multiple social media users pointing to the Time Magazine cover of Taylor Swift with her cat draped around her shoulders and saying things like \"The armageddon is coming for him\" and \"Vance attacked childless women who love cats. Taylor Swift would probably like a word.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerstin_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kerstin Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James K.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) \"don't really have a direct stake\" in the country's future because they are \"people without children.\" In the clip, which has amassed more than 25 million views since it was shared Monday on X, Vance also refers to Democrats as \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "caitlin_gibson@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Caitlin Gibson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance than I'd like to admit.\n\nWe attended the same law school. In 2016, we both saw Donald Trump for what he was. We don't have an ounce of charisma between us. And we're each waaaaay Too Online.\n\nBeing Too Online is unfortunate in a pundit but potentially disastrous in a candidate. The more activist political content you consume, the greater the risk that you'll misjudge what normal American voters who aren't Too Online care about.\n\nIn my case, that occasionally (or frequently) leads to bad takes. In Vance's case, it might mean blowing a national election.\n\nIf you had told me before the Republican convention that Trump's party would quickly come to regret nominating Vance for vice president, I would have nodded and said, \"Sure, seems plausible.\" And I would have been right: There is, apparently, already buyer's remorse afoot within the GOP a week after Vance joined the ticket.\n\nIt's not all his fault. With Kamala Harris replacing Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Republicans are suddenly looking at a tighter race and a different demographic path to 270 electoral votes. Picking Vance \"was something of a luxury meant to run up margins with the base in a blowout rather than persuade swing voters in a nail-biter,\" The Atlantic's Tim Alberta reported on Sunday. An unnamed House Republican told Axios earlier this week that, with Harris now at the top of the Democratic ticket, the Vance pick \"doesn't add much\" and \"the capacity to have expanded the map a little bit ... would have been much more beneficial.\"\n\nChoosing a running mate who appeals to precisely the same voting blocs that Trump already appeals to is something you do when the election is in the bag, not when you have a fight on your hands. In hindsight, a-ahem-\"DEI hire\" like Marco Rubio or Tim Scott might have been more electorally fruitful.\n\nBut some of the buyer's remorse is about Vance specifically. He's awkward on the stump. Voters seem to instinctively not like him. According to Punchbowl News, nearly 80 percent of Republican staffers and lobbyists interviewed at last week's convention disapproved of him as the VP pick. To borrow a line from Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, Vance is simply a weird guy in a party that's teeming with them.\n\nEven some of his fans in Moscow have apparently developed misgivings about him as their initialeuphoria about his selection has faded.\n\nI would have predicted that Vance's great liability on the national ticket would be his blatant contempt for the constitutional order or his callousness toward Ukraine and cynical justifications for it. But because I'm Too Online and out of touch with normal Americans, I would have been wrong.\n\nJ.D. Vance's big problem with voters is shaping up to be \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nModern America has a lot of them, you know. Including one who's about to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nCallousness, as usual.\n\nWorrying about childlessness in and of itself doesn't make you Too Online. That's a serious national concern. A country that no longer reproduces enough to replace its population is destined for stagnation, instability, and fiscal crisis. Some American allies are already staring down the barrel of it.\n\nAmerica itself isn't far behind.\n\nWhat makes you Too Online is reducing a phenomenon as sensitive and complicated as childlessness to brain-dead culture-war demagoguery about \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nThat was J.D. Vance in 2021. This was also J.D. Vance in 2021, endorsing Demeny voting, a proposal that would give more weight to the votes of parents on behalf of their children:\n\nHis logic in both soundbites is similar. Not only should we presume that all childless Americans care less about the future of the country than all American parents do, we should impose civic disabilities on them because of it. The power of their votes should be diluted by granting extra ballots to those with children. And voters should regard them as unfit to serve responsibly in public office because they lack the same \"direct stake\" in the country that parents have.\n\nVance said this, mind you, surely knowing that George Washington himself had no biological children. The father of our country somehow managed to father our country despite having fathered nothing else. The closest he came to children of his own was being a step-parent. Just like \"childless cat lady\" Kamala Harris.\n\nThe same is true of the most influential right-wing reactionary in American politics since George Wallace and before Donald Trump. That would be Pat Buchanan, of course, who's regarded as a sort of intellectual godfather to Trumpism. No kids.\n\nThere's a lot that's irksome about Vance's attempt to divide America into tribes of parents and \"cat ladies\" but we can start with the obvious: It's shockingly callous, even by the gutter standards of populist-nationalist chuds.\n\nAfter all, not everyone is childless by choice. Social media is filled this week with stories from hopeful parents who had their dreams dashed by tragedy. Some suffered miscarriages; some had bad luck with IVF; some didn't meet the right person before their window for having children closed. Last year, in a piece for the Institute for Family Studies, one author recalled being told by a CDC researcher that no less than 80 percent of women of childbearing age plan or hope to have children someday. Many won't get their wish.\n\nShould we treat them as unfit for office because of it? What about parents whose children died in childhood, leaving them untethered to America's future?\n\nOf course not, Vance would say-and did say. I was referring to people who are childless by choice. But his point about parents having a \"direct stake\" in America's future should make the cause of childlessness irrelevant. If the problem with not having kids is that it leaves one with less motivation to ensure that the United States remains a country worth inheriting, the reason for not having them shouldn't matter. He's making an incoherent exception for those who aren't childless by choice simply to reduce the callousness of his position.\n\nAnd what about those who arechildless by choice because their personal pursuit of happiness led them to prioritize a career over child-rearing? They're proud of their success, as they should be, yet now find themselves being mocked for their choices as \"cat ladies.\" Imagine working hard to achieve the American dream only to be told by the vice presidential nominee for one of the two major parties that you're \"miserable\" and \"want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\"\n\nIt's ugly, but it's characteristic. Nationalism is a tribal ideology and tribes don't much care what individuals want.\n\nSneering at \"childless cat ladies\" isn't the sort of thing a smart, ambitious young politician does on national television if he's looking for ways to build goodwill among the general electorate. It's the sort of thing he does if he's a Too Online populist edgelord eager to ingratiate himself to a claque of like-minded reactionaries.\n\nThe New Right's agenda.\n\nIt's not an accident that Vance pushed his message on Tucker Carlson's show, as childlessness has become a hobby horse of nationalist ideologues.\n\nTucker himself accused uber-hawk Lindsey Graham earlier this year of supporting Ukraine's defense because Graham has no children. A few days ago, after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden at the top of the ballot, populist influencer Will Chamberlain declared that \"the 2024 election is really parents vs. the childless.\"\n\nThat the race would turn instantly into a referendum on parenthood the moment a Democrat with several children was replaced by one with none goes to show how opportunistic the critique is, even among people who purport to take it seriously. There's nothing in Harris' program that suggests she'd be more or less hostile to parents as president than Biden, but attacking her for it is an easy way to signal to a right-wing tribe of traditionalists that she's not One Of Us.\n\nAnother example: The closest thing Vance has to a kindred spirit in politics is failed Senate candidate turned House candidate Blake Masters, a fellow recipient of tech billionaire Peter Thiel's largesse in 2022. This week, Masters rode to Vance's defense on the alleged perils of childlessness. \"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married,\" he wrote. \"If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations? Skin in the game matters.\"\n\nMaybe Masters believes that. But even if he doesn't, he has an obvious and urgent electoral motive to want Republican voters to view childless candidates with suspicion. Abe Hamadeh, his primary opponent, doesn't have a wife or kids. He's not One Of Us.\n\nDefining \"Us\" is the chief preoccupation of nationalism, and an \"Us\" that believes America can be made great again only by reversing 60 years of cultural liberalization naturally resents seeing women forgo motherhood for work. Vance's emphasis on childless cat \"ladies\" is a tell in that regard: He didn't need to gender his critique, as his complaint about childless people not having a stake in America's future applies equally well to men. But it's not men whose childlessness so offends revanchist traditionalists, is it?\n\nInsofar as nationalists see men diminished by childlessness, the idea seems to be that it calls their masculinity into question. Vance singled out Pete Buttigieg, a gay man, as an example of a childless male leader during his 2021 interview with Carlson, never mind that Buttigieg and his husband were in the process of trying to adopt at the time. Carlson singled out Graham, whose bachelor status has long been chum for the D.C. rumor mill, in his critique of Russia hawks even though many members of Congress who support Ukraine have children.\n\nAgain, if you view the right's objection to childlessness mainly as a form of traditionalist tribal signaling, it makes sense that men whom they regard as effete would be prime targets for it.\n\nTheir contempt for the childless also has an element of blood-and-soil nationalism lurking in it, unsurprisingly. Many populists accuse Democrats of a plot to replace \"real Americans\" with third-worlders en masse in order to remake the country demographically. That leaves them in a race of sorts with the usurpers to establish control of the United States, and that race can't be won by securing the southern border alone. The enemy will need to be outbred as well, and the childless among us aren't pulling their weight.\n\nJ.D. Vance can be safely excluded from the cohort that believes in an American \"volk,\" but some of his new constituents unfortunately cannot.\n\nStill, the most incisive criticism I've seen of right-wing fulmination about childlessness came from my former Dispatch colleague, Andrew Egger. \"I am extremely pronatalist,\" he wrote earlier this week, \"but it is not lost on me that a significant reason pronatalism has caught fire on the right these days is because 'have kids' is the only real 'family value' a movement headed by philandering freaks like Trump and Elon Musk can carry forward.\"\n\nIn virtually every way, from moderating on abortion to inviting adult models to speak at the national convention to whatever the hell this is, Trump's Republican Party is less \"family oriented\" than what preceded it. In fact, the member of the party most closely associated with family values happens to be the member most widely despised by the base. That would be Mitt Romney, whose (very!) large and loving family has earned him zero credibility among populists as a man fit to lead.\n\nTreating parenthood as some special qualification for civic responsibility is nationalists' way of compensating for the right's Trumpian drift away from wholesomeness. True to form, instead of simply celebrating the virtues of having children, their critique is framed mainly as a reason to distrust and delegitimize their political enemies. It's entirely in character for them to treat a serious problem like falling birth rates as a lowbrow pretext to try to morally disqualify liberals like Kamala Harris from office.\n\nNeedless to say, if Donald Trump were childless, types like Vance would never have dared to suggest that parenthood is a necessary qualification for office. They'd be comparing Trump to George Washington, or admiring his virility in refusing to be tied down while boinking his way across Manhattan.\n\nIn the end, if nationalism's interests diverge from the cult's, nationalism must yield. Even for the \"serious\" intellectuals in the movement.\n\nA backlash or not?\n\nI doubt that any of this will matter much to the campaign, though.\n\nThat's not (just) because my opinion of American voters is as low as it can get. It's because the backlash to Vance's \"childless cat lady\" remarks will be concentrated among single women, and most single women are already voting Democratic.\n\nBut who knows? Having the GOP vice presidential nominee on camera evincing contempt for childlessness could add some oomph to Democratic attacks on red-state abortion bans and conservative skepticism of IVF. \"Republicans hate women having freedoms!\" might ring a little truer to undecided voters with Vance babbling about how not having kids should render you a second-class citizen.\n\nIt's also an uncomfortable fact for the right that the most popular woman in America, worshiped by tens of millions of adoring fans, is herself a childless cat lady who may yet have something to say about the election. Maybe that won't matter. Maybe it will.\n\nBut I hope there is a backlash to what he said, and not just because I want Vance and his running mate to lose. Or because it'd be really funny to see J.D.'s years of desperate sycophancy in search of power end with Trump scapegoating him ruthlessly for the defeat.\n\nI want to see a backlash because I resent being told by an authoritarian bootlicker like J.D. Vance that he cares more about the future of America than I do, and for no reason grander than biological happenstance. I've spent nine years arguing daily against Trumpism because I care about America's future; I don't need to have a \"direct stake\" in it to know that it'll be brighter under liberalism, as classically understood, than under whatever he and Trump have planned.\n\nSomeday, perhaps, after the populist threat has passed, his kids will thank me for my effort to see him defeated. And if they don't, they're welcome anyway.\n\nPatriotism, not accidents of procreation, is why Americans have a stake in America's future. It doesn't surprise me that nationalists would struggle to relate.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "idahostatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho Statesman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_catoggio@idahostatesman.com", "name": "Nick Catoggio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance's comments on 'Childless Cat Ladies' by sharing Her IVF story | English Movie News - Times of India", "body": "Jennifer Aniston has taken a stand against Senator J.D. Vance's controversial remarks. After a clip of the Republican vice presidential nominee discussing 'childless cat ladies' went viral, Aniston responded with a heartfelt message on Instagram, touching on her own struggles with fertility and in-vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nIn the viral clip from 2021, Vance criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, U.S.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, labeling them as \"childless cat ladies\" who should not have a significant role in political decision-making. His comments resurfaced amid President Joe Biden's decision to step down from the election, nominating Harris as the Democratic candidate.\n\nJennifer Aniston, known for her role in 'Friends,' clapped back at Vance's comments. On July 24, she posted an Instagram Story addressing Vance directly. She expressed hope that his daughter would one day have the opportunity to bear children, without needing to rely on fertility treatments like IVF, which Vance's political stance seems to oppose.\n\nAniston wrote, 'All I can say is, Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.' She continued, hoping that his daughter wouldn't need IVF, pointing out that Vance is attempting to restrict access to such treatments.\n\nThis isn't the first time Aniston has opened up about her fertility struggles. In a 2022 interview with Allure, she revealed her long and challenging journey with IVF, which included trying various treatments and methods. She shared how she had wished someone had advised her to freeze her eggs earlier, as she faced significant struggles in her efforts to get pregnant.\n\nAniston mentioned feeling a sense of relief now that that period of her life is behind her. She talked about how protective she has been of her personal story and how she feels liberated by finally sharing her experiences.\n\nHer candidness about her IVF journey and response to Vance's comments highlights the struggles many women face with fertility and the importance of having access to reproductive health treatments. Aniston's message serves as a powerful reminder of the personal and emotional aspects behind such political debates.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

J.D. Vance could become the next Vice President of the U.S. after hearing his resurfaced 2021 comments that women like Vice President Kamala Harris who have not given birth are \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.\"\n\n\"All I can say is... Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston, 55, who has shared her personal IVF story in the past, wrote on her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, July 24.\n\n\"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,\" Aniston continued. \"Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.\"\n\nRelated: Who Will Kamala Harris Pick as Her 2024 Running Mate? Possible VP Candidates to Fill Out New Democratic Ticket\n\nAniston's post included a screenshot of a tweet resurfacing Vance's July 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. In the interview, the Ohio Republican, 39, said the U.S. was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nVance, whom Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named his running mate on July 15, then mentioned Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Harris is now running for president after President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance told Carlson. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nHarris is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children, son Cole, 29, and daughter Ella, 25. Vance and his wife Usha are parents to three children, sons Ewan, 6 and Vivek, 4, and daughter Mirabel, 2.\n\nRelated: Kamala Harris' Memoir Tops Multiple Amazon Bestseller Charts Following Presidential Campaign Launch\n\nAniston told Allure in November 2022 it was \"really hard\" to see the pregnancy rumors that plagued her throughout her career.\n\n\"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard,\" she said. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.

That decision is ours and ours alone,\" Aniston wrote. \"Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. Let's make that decision consciously, outside of the tabloid noise. We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete.

D. Vance, Trump's Regrettable Impulse Buy", "body": "Only a week ago, the Republicans were happy, united in their belief that God had spared Donald Trump for a higher purpose. Their convention looked like a wild, weird victory parade for an election that was already in the bag. And J. D. Vance, the newly announced vice-presidential candidate, was the party's golden child.\n\nYeah, about that. Since Sunday, Joe Biden's abrupt exit and the smooth coronation of Kamala Harris as the Democrats' presumptive nominee have transformed the presidential race. Trump's campaign is no longer playing on easy mode. Senior Democrats who spent the past month fending off questions about the president's cognitive abilities are now getting airtime for phrases such as convicted felon, growing economy, and women's right to make choices about their own body. In her first rally after the Biden news broke, Kamala Harris, although never renowned as a charismatic orator, effortlessly cleared the low bar of seeming energetic and coherent.\n\nBiden's departure allows the Democrats to turn their opponents' best attack line back on them: Maybe old men whose sentences go off on weird tangents shouldn't run for president? (If so, this is terrible news for Trump's favorite stump-speech riffs about Hannibal Lecter and being eaten by a shark.) Moving Harris up to the top of the ticket also allows her to select a vice-presidential candidate to broaden the Democrats' appeal, in both demographic and geographic terms.\n\nRead: The Harris gamble\n\nIn that context, the Republican choice of J. D. Vance looks less like a masterstroke and more like the impulse purchase of a luxury good -- an expensive handbag bought on a credit card the day before its owner gets fired. Trump should have kept the receipt.\n\nAs a senator from Ohio, Vance doesn't bring a swing state with him; even his family's roots in Kentucky have been the subject of a multiday roasting by that state's Democratic governor. Nor does he bring a strong personal following; in 2022, he underperformed the rest of the Republican slate in Ohio. And Vance obviously has no deep convictions, having once called his new boss \"America's Hitler\" in private and \"cultural heroin\" in public. Trump presumably loves watching a former critic debase himself for power, but voters can usually smell a phony.\n\nWorst of all, Vance's real base is not the stout citizens of Appalachia, but the libertarian edgelords of Silicon Valley (who are largely voter-repellent when exposed to the light) and the right-wing memeplex (ditto). Unfortunately, the kind of material that has X users such as MAGA Barbie, Catturd, and The Dank Knight hammering the \"Like\" button is not a winning message in the real world. In 2016, we heard a lot about how the left didn't understand Trump's unique appeal, but Vance and his online boosters don't understand it either. The past decade of American politics suggests that you can indeed say the quiet part out loud, but only if you make it funny.\n\nTrump's fundamental campiness -- an attribute that most people would never have suspected was a winning one for a Republican presidential candidate -- is essential to his success. Meatball Ron, Low-Energy Jeb, Pocahontas -- the former president's insults are mean, but cartoonish, like material from a Netflix comedy roast or a WWE SmackDown. His many imitators have gotten the message that they can be gratuitously rude and bullying. But they have neglected to be funny.\n\nWhat that looks like in practice is J. D. Vance flat-out stating that Kamala Harris is an unnatural woman for not having biological children. \"We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too,\" he told Tucker Carlson in 2021, in a clip that immediately resurfaced after his nomination. \"And it's just a basic fact if you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\"\n\nYes, plenty of people believe that having kids makes you a better person, because their own experiences of parenthood have given joy and meaning to their lives. But few people would be so crass as to preen about it before a television audience, which invariably includes people who desperately wanted to start a family and could not. And even fewer would imply, as Vance did, that stepkids like Harris's don't count. Neither, apparently, do the two kids whom Buttigieg and his husband adopted. \"The really sad thing is that [Vance] said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,\" Buttigieg said yesterday on CNN. \"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\"\n\nVance's casually dismissive language demonstrates that he is not a man chosen to appeal to swing voters. This was a man chosen to delight people who were already planning to vote for Trump. The GOP has a problem with women voters, who are far less likely to support the party than men. Republicans know this. Before the convention, Trump's team successfully pushed for the party's platform not to include a federal abortion ban, well aware that the issue has become a huge liability for the right. Now the defining clip so far of their potential VP is a hack line about cat ladies that would have sounded sexist in 1974? Ouch.\n\nThe Republican response to the cat-lady discourse is split between claiming that it's unfair -- the clip is three years old and has undoubtedly been pushed by Democrats who suspect it's a turnoff to swing voters -- and that it's awesome. But it is representative of Vance's broader tone and (current) political positions: I watched him speak over Zoom at the National Conservative conference in London last year, and the main message he delivered was that Britain's then-ruling Conservative Party wasn't right-wing enough. Earlier this month, the Tories' subsequent hard-line positions on immigration and cultural issues helped bring about a generational defeat in this year's election, at the hands of a centrist.\n\nHelen Lewis: Why so many conservatives feel like losers\n\nCan Vance learn how to preach to anyone but the choir? His speech to the RNC featured a sweet passage about his mom's sobriety, but also a very strange riff about how, after his beloved grandmother died, the family found 19 loaded guns stashed around her house. \"And so this frail old woman made sure that no matter where she was, she was within arm's length of whatever she needed to protect her family,\" Vance said. \"That's who we fight for. That's American spirit.\" Look, I'm not American, so I'm wired differently on gun control, but is this a heartwarming story? Or is this a tragic fable about an old woman who had been told every day by politicians and talking heads that she was besieged in her own home? Does the Republican Party really believe that the American dream is having a gun in every room because the country is a lawless hellhole?\n\nOne of the emerging attacks on Harris is that she is cringe -- she laughs oddly, and too loudly, and too often. Again, this would be an easier blow to land if the Republican vice-presidential pick hadn't just scored a viral moment claiming that the left thinks everything is racist. \"I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today, and I'm sure they're going to call that racist too,\" he said at a campaign rally. The room did not go wild. It went semidomesticated at best.\n\nCNN recently reported that Vance has a negative rating among voters -- the first for a VP pick immediately after his or her party's convention since 1980. How will that go down with Trump, a man who hates weakness and who has been known to disparage his allies in public?\n\nVance will presumably try to redeem himself by zeroing in on Harris's weak spots and pummeling them as hard as a vice-presidential candidate can. One of her liabilities is having taken a number of unpopular pandemic-era progressive positions and postures. The clip in which she announced her pronouns while wearing a COVID mask might have been grown in a lab for the specific purpose of enraging Elon Musk fans on X -- or giving ammo to a culture warrior like Vance. But the Harris team knows that the perception of her as \"woke\" is a problem -- hence the widespread assumption that her VP pick will be a white man with a track record of appealing to swing voters. By contrast, Trump picked an edgelord whose best punch line so far featured Mountain Dew.\n\nTwo weeks ago, that decision appeared a lot more sensible than it does today. And look -- everyone will admire you for having a Dior handbag on your arm. But not if you lose your house as a result.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_lewis@theatlantic.com", "name": "Helen Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Like Carlson, Vance had once opposed Donald Trump, and like Carlson, he had transformed into a prominent Trump supporter and a rabid participant in the culture wars. \"We are effectively run in the country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs,\" he told Carlson, \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\" He went on to name Kamala Harris (and Pete Buttigieg, and AOC) as his prime examples of the childless leaders who should be excluded from positions of power.\n\nFor years, Vance has played a key role in the elite echelons of the New Right, which can be described, loosely, as the intellectual wing of the Trumpified GOP (including many of the people in charge of Project 2025). This mixed-up group of intellectuals, activists, politicians and influencers is made up of a wide array of characters, who hold to a variety of belief systems and sometimes have divergent policy goals.\n\nBut the one instinct that Vance and the rest of the New Right share is a deep skepticism about modern feminism and gender equality -- or what the New Right calls \"gender ideology.\" Overt chauvinism that seeks to roll back much of feminism's gains is one of the most obvious unifying threads of this varied movement, and Trump's choice of Vance anoints and entrenches it into the culture-war side of the MAGA movement.\n\nVance appears to be a decent family man -- someone who supports traditional conservative values, and is even willing to buck conventional GOP norms by supporting strong pro-family policies. But a quick perusal of his thoughts on women and gender reveal some unusual opinions that lie outside the American mainstream, beyond a stray comment about cat ladies.\n\nVance is staunchly opposed to abortion, and has suggestedthat it is wrong even in cases of rape and incest. He has compared the evil of abortion to that of slavery, and opposed the Ohio ballot measure ensuring the right to abortion in 2023. He also was one of only 28 members of Congress who opposed a new HIPAA rule that would limit law enforcement's access to women's medical records. He has promoted Viktor Orban's pro-natalist policies in Hungary, which offer paybacks to married couples that scale up along with the number of children (a new Hungarian Constitution that banned gay marriage went into effect in 2012, so these benefits only serve \"traditional\" couples). Vance opposes same-sex marriage. During his 2022 Senate campaign, he suggested the sexual revolution had made divorce too easy (people nowadays \"shift spouses like they change their underwear\"), arguing that people in unhappy marriages, and maybe even those in violent ones, should stay together for their children. His campaign saidsuch an insinuation was \"preposterous,\" but you can watch the video yourself and be the judge.\n\nIn all of this, Vance fits squarely within (and identifies with) the faction of the American New Right that typically refers to itself as \"postliberalism.\"\n\nPatrick Deneen, a professor at Notre Dame, captured the basic outlook on gender and feminism among this cohort in his 2018 hit Why Liberalism Failed. Deneen's argument is that liberal modernity is based on an irreparably individualistic view of human nature, which leads to a culture that values autonomy over community and family life. \"Liberalism posits that freeing women from the household is tantamount to liberation,\" he wrote, \"but it effectively puts women and men alike into a far more encompassing bondage,\" because work outside the home is submission to the forces of market capitalism. Somewhat bizarrely, in the postliberal mind, even gay marriage -- people coming together and uniting legally into family units -- becomes a form of social dissolution, because it is based on individual choice rather than traditional moral forms.\n\nVance is an admirer of Deneen's work and was a featured speaker at the launch of his most recent book, Regime Change, at Catholic University in May 2023. Vance spoke highly of Deneen's book, identified personally with postliberalism and the New Right, and declared himself to be \"anti-elitist\" and \"anti-regime.\" He has picked up on the populist language used by the postliberals, who speak in all-or-nothing terms like the \"ruling class,\" \"replacing the elites,\" \"using Machiavellian means to Aristotelian ends,\" or \"searing the liberal faith with hot irons.\"\n\nThe most important figure in American postliberalism is Harvard professor Adrian Vermeule, whose 2022 book Common Good Constitutionalism describes a mode of constitutional thinking that would make it much easier for conservatives in the United States to legislate morality. Under Vermeule's conception, judges could rule against a given law -- say a law allowing marriage equality, or abortion in another state -- by appealing to his \"Common Good\" standard.\n\nVance is also friendly with the Claremont Institute, an election-denying \"nerve center\" for the broader New Right movement. He gave a speech at their newly opened \"Center for the American Way of Life\" in 2021 where, revealingly, he declared that the conservative movement should be about something simple: \"I think that we should fight for the right of every American to live a good life in the country they call their own, to raise a family and dignity on a single middle-class job.\"\n\nThe Claremont cohort is home to, or friendly with, some of the most extreme anti-feminists and misogynists in the movement, such as Scott Yenor, a professor at Boise State and a fellow with Claremont's Center for the American Way of Life. He courted controversy in 2021 for calling career-oriented women \"more medicated, meddlesome and quarrelsome than women need to be.\" Or Jack Murphy, a stalwart of the Manosphere, who once declared that \"feminists need rape,\" and was a fellow with Claremont in 2021. Many of the leaders at the Institute, including Yenor and the president, Ryan Williams, are also part of a newly formed and pro-patriarchy fraternal organization, the Society for American Civic Renewal.\n\nAs for Vance's comments about miserable cat ladies, they sound like the tamer musings of far-right extremists like Costin Alamariu, whose 2018 book Bronze Age Mindset popularized the concept of \"the Longhouse,\" a disparaging description of a political culture dominated by women, or Stephen Wolfe, who similarly rails against a \"gynocracy\" society where women have outsize control in his 2023 book The Case for Christian Nationalism and believes that in the ideal state women would not have the right to vote.\n\nVance's mentor Peter Thiel, who is also well-connected in the New Right world, has expressed similar views about women's suffrage, writing in a 2009 essay, \"Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women -- two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians -- have rendered the notion of \"capitalist democracy\" into an oxymoron.\"\n\nNational Conservatism is the big tent, umbrella organization where the New Right comes together. Vance has been a speaker at all three of the four National Conservatism conferences that have taken place in the United States since 2019 -- including the meeting in D.C. earlier this month, where he gave the final keynote address at a VIP dinner on the closing day. Whereas the first big NatCon conference seemed like an upstart, fringe affair, this year, Chris DeMuth, a former American Enterprise Institute president who is one of the conference's key leaders, opened the conference by declaring: \"A revival of faith, family, and fertility are not far right, they are the new mainstream!\" Vance, for his part, gave a speech titled \"America is a Nation,\" which touched only lightly on questions of gender, merely echoing DeMuth's call for a renewal of the American family. Patrick Deneen was pleased.\n\nBack in 2022, writer James Pogue went to NatCon 2 and profiled the rising New Right for Vanity Fair. Pogue detailed an interview that Vance did in September 2021 with Jack Murphy, where Vance said he was convinced the liberal order was about to collapse, and was hoping for something dramatic from Trump. When Pogue asked Vance directly why what he had in mind for the country was not in fact a fascist takeover, Vance explained that if what he had in mind worked, \"it will mean that my son grows up in a world where his masculinity -- his support of his family and his community, his love of his community -- is more important than whether it works for fucking McKinsey.\" Fair enough, but I worry about what this means for our daughters, especially in MAGA's masculinist, zero-sum world.\n\nTrump lost women by 15 points in 2020; if he has any hope of moving back into the White House he'll need to make up at least a bit of that ground. But if he hoped the vice presidential pick would help with that he may be sadly mistaken. While Trump's sexism has manifested as a crude machismo, Vance, along with his New Right fellow-travelers, is about to introduce voters to a more conceptual take on sexism -- one which many women, and indeed many men, might find even more alarming.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Right",

Her Blended Family Is Defending Her.", "body": "In a 2021 interview with Fox News, JD Vance lamented that the United States was being run by \"childless cat ladies\" like Vice President Kamala Harris, women who he claimed had no \"direct stake\" in the country's future.\n\nThis week, Ms. Harris received a powerful gesture of support from one of her biggest advocates: the mother of her stepchildren.\n\n\"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" Kerstin Emhoff said in a statement released by the office of the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ella Emhoff chimed in as well: \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,\" she wrote on Instagram, urging her mother to \"say it louder for the people in the back.\"\n\nAlthough the comments by Mr. Vance are several years old, dating to when he was running for the Senate, they are landing differently in a new political climate.\n\nMr. Vance is now former President Donald J. Trump's running mate, and his words have resurfaced at a moment when many women, in polls and at the ballot box, are defending their right to make their own choices -- about abortion, birth control, access to fertility services or not having children at all.\n\nIn the Fox interview, Mr. Vance said Ms. Harris and other Democrats, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, \"don't really have a direct stake\" in the future because they are \"people without children.\" (Mr. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, welcomed twins in August 2021.)\n\nMr. Vance said the country is run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the remarks, which resurfaced earlier this week. But Mr. Vance's sister, Lindsay Lewis, called the criticism a machination of the media and the Democratic Party.\n\n\"JD was raised by some of the strongest women I know and went on to marry an incredibly strong woman in Usha,\" Ms. Lewis said in a statement sent through her brother's office. \"JD is a testament to the women in his life, and the attacks from the media and Democrats that assume anything otherwise is vile.\"\n\nMs. Harris married Mr. Emhoff in 2014, when Cole and Ella were teenagers. Ms. Harris, whose parents had filed for divorce by the time she was eight, wrote in Elle magazine in 2019 that she was initially wary of being a \"temporary fixture\" in the children's lives.\n\nShe said they built the relationship over time. \"I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in,\" she wrote. Years later, the trio decided on a name for Ms. Harris that sounded warmer than the term \"stepmom.\" They came up with \"Momala.\"\n\nSenator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat of New Hampshire who gave advice to Ms. Harris on balancing work and parenting when the vice president was a senator, called Mr. Vance's comments \"inane\" and \"insidious.\"\n\n\"Vice President Harris's children already know how strong, warm, loving and talented she is,\" Ms. Hassan said.\n\nThe outrage over Mr. Vance's remarks has been bipartisan.\n\n\"I've followed JD Vance's evolution over the last few years and knew of the comment and was repulsed by it then and now,\" said Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Republican strategist and Trump administration official who now co-hosts \"The View.\" \"But so many women in my life -- left, right, and center -- are just discovering it and couldn't be more turned off. To suggest women without kids have less value in society is offensive.\"\n\nMeghan McCain, a conservative commentator and the daughter of Senator John McCain, wrote on social media that Mr. Vance's comments would have a ripple effect, angering families who have had to turn to fertility procedures to have children -- or people who don't want their reproductive status commented on or judged at all.\n\n\"I have been trying to warn every conservative man I know,\" she said. \"These JD comments are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump-supporting friends. These comments have caused real pain and are just innately unchristian. This is not who we are.\"\n\nReproductive rights have fueled Democratic victories across the country in the nearly two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nMs. Harris has emerged as the most outspoken defender of abortion rights in the Biden administration, while Mr. Vance, who has described himself as \"100 percent pro-life,\" has supported a federal abortion ban and opposed exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nNow, as a vice-presidential candidate, Mr. Vance has tried to modify his past views.\n\n\"You have to believe in reasonable exceptions because that's where the American people are,\" Mr. Vance told Fox News this week. Americans say at record levels that they support at least some access to abortion.\n\nMs. Harris and other Democrats have said the Supreme Court's repeal of Roe v. Wade had consequences that could also affect access to fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization.\n\nEarlier this year in Alabama, the state's Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos could be considered \"extrauterine children\" under state law, prompting several fertility clinics in the state to suspend I.V.F. treatments. The governor had to sign an emergency order protecting the practice.\n\nMr. Vance signed onto a letter in June supporting access to in vitro fertilization.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Harris campaign sent an email to supporters, wishing a \"Happy World IVF Day to Everyone Except JD Vance.\"\n\nAccording to Centers for Disease Control data on fertility clinic success rates, in 2021 there were about 167,689 egg or embryo-banking cycles performed in which all the eggs or embryos were frozen for future use. Approximately 2.3 percent of all infants born in the United States every year are conceived using assisted reproductive technology.\n\nMs. Farah Griffin said that questioning women's choices about motherhood is a losing political strategy.\n\n\"If I were the Harris campaign,\" Ms. Farah Griffin said. \"I would air that clip in suburban media markets in swing states from now until Election Day.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

Vance, who Donald Trump recently selected as his running mate for the upcoming election, during an TV interview on Fox News in 2021, in which he criticised Vice President Kamala Harris for having no children of her own.\n\nHarris, 59, is a stepmother to two kids with her husband Doug Emhoff.\n\nAt the time, Mr Vance, 39, said the US was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nFurther, he claimed women have \"no direct stake\" in the country.\n\nAniston, who doesn't have children, re-posted a clip of the exchange on her Instagram story Thursday, writing she \"truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.\"\n\n\"All I can say is, Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,\" Aniston continued.\n\n\"I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option.

He has endorsed a series of conservative policies, including opposing abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nAniston, for her part, famously gave a rare, candid interview with Allure in December 2022, in which she revealed her long-term desire to have children despite media reports claiming her 2005 marriage breakdown with Brad Pitt was because she didn't want kids, and that she had prioritised her career over becoming a mother.\n\nDuring \"all the years of [media] speculation,\" the Friends star was \"going through IVF [and] drinking Chinese teas.\"\n\n\"I was throwing everything at it.

Now that women are part of the political arena, those expectations weigh even more heavily.\n\nWe can't be too soft and nurturing, because then we won't be taken seriously. We can't be too smart, sassy or strong, because then we are seen as intimidating or cold. And now, according to JD Vance and the latest chatter on X, we can't hold positions of power if we don't have children and therefore don't have \"skin in the game\".\n\nAs a woman without children myself, I'm aghast - but hardly astonished by these comments. In 2021, Trump's running mate Vance attacked Kamala Harris and other childless democrats in an interview with Tucker Carlson, calling her and her team \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" The clip has now gone viral again on social media.\n\nIn making these vile and stereotypical comments, Vance essentially asserted that a person who does not have children is intrinsically less valuable than someone who does. He ignored a study by Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics, that suggests women without children are the happiest demographic. Vance also claimed that that child-free people have \"no physical commitment to the future of this country.\"\n\nDespite the fact that Kamala has stepchildren, a niece and grandnieces, she apparently has no \"direct stake\" in the future of her country because she has no biological children of her own. That's as patently untrue as it is offensive.\n\nThis week, conservative lawyer Will Chamberlain posted on X that Harris shouldn't become president because she doesn't have children and therefore doesn't have \"skin in the game, a stake in the future, and the lived experience of raising children\".\n\nIf a deep and loving connection to stepchildren, nieces and nephews doesn't count, what does that mean for blended families, adoptive parents, foster parents, or parents who have lost a child? There are plenty of ways to create a positive legacy, and biological parenting is only one of them.\n\nIt's deeply offensive to say that if you don't have kids, you don't have a stake in the future. I don't have children. There are no stepchildren in my life. Nor am I a \"cat lady\". You don't need to be a parent to care deeply about the future of our planet and the generations that will follow you.\n\nThere are plenty of politicians with children who have made a spectacular mess of running their country. The ability or desire to have children has no bearing on an individual's passion, intelligence or empathy; qualities that Vance seems to be lacking in spades.\n\nIt clearly doesn't suit outdated misogynistic agendas to have a strong woman living life on her own terms and influencing policy. Men can live a life of their choosing, unencumbered by societal expectations. Women are still being judged on their desire or ability to procreate. So, inevitably we have the far right claiming that a woman without children is not qualified to run the country.\n\nWhat's really going on here? I think the patriarchy is running scared. Women are waking up to the fact that motherhood is challenging and that they have agency in how they live their lives. Regardless of steps forward in gender equality, it's still the woman's life that will fundamentally change when a child comes along.\n\nThe UK birth rate has been falling for years and in the US it has reached a historic low. Policy makers must surely be worried. Yet rather than enacting plans that will support women who want to embrace motherhood; like better healthcare, childcare and more affordable housing, it's easier to lash out at women who don't toe the baby-making line. Women like Kamala Harris. Women who have decided to live life on their own terms.\n\nVance has also intimated that people without children should have fewer voting rights. Apparently not having children makes you a second-class citizen. Really? If you take that dystopian argument to its logical conclusion, then no man should get a vote about anything that affects female healthcare, reproductive rights or abortion.\n\nThe pro-natalist rhetoric gets louder and louder as birth rates get lower and lower. Women exerting their reproductive rights seems to awaken the ire of every misogynist on the planet.

This stuff is embarrassing and incoherent, and people in the Republican Party should be willing to say so.\"\n\n\"Astonishing parallels below between slave owners who counted 3/5 of their slaves in the census to inflate their political power and @JDVance promoting extra voting power for parents. As the father of 8, I find his views repugnant,\" wrote professor of law and journalism David Cay Johnston.\n\nDespite the pushback, Vance's remarks and beliefs were propped up Wednesday night by Republican candidate Blake Masters, who wrote: \"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married. If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations? Skin in the game matters.\"\n\nNow Masters is getting pushback as well.\n\n\"According to @bgmasters, echoing the sentiment of @JDVance and the Trump campaign, if you've miscarried, you have no skin in the game. If you're Lindsey Graham or Tim Scott, you're not eligible to govern. If you're a widow or widower, you can't run a household,\" wrote Travis Akers, a retired Naval Intelligence Officer, veterans' advocate, and activist.\n\nPolitical commentator and former Obama spokesperson Tommy Vietor responded with a personal story:\n\n\"My wife and I had multiple, soul-crushing miscarriages, and one still born daughter before we were able to have children. Millions of parents are desperate to have kids but simply can't. Treating people without children like they are lesser human beings is unbelievably cruel.\"\n\nMarcy Wheeler, a noted civil rights and national security journalist also shared her personal story, writing: \"A year after marrying my beloved spouse of 20+ years, I started 6 years of cancer treatment, which largely closed window we would have had children. Sh*thole men who can't understand those kinds of questions simply can't relate to choices families face everyday.\"", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"},

J.D. Vance (R-OH) speaks during a campaign rally at the Van Andel Arena on July 20, 2024 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nVice presidential nominee JD Vance's comments that \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" run the country earned a scathing tear-down from \"The View\" co-host Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nThe comments, made in a segment on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program in 2021, instantly inspired backlash when they resurfaced online. In a segment of her show this week, Goldberg joined discussions on whether Vance's odd and unpopular past comments on women make him a liability for Trump.\n\n\"There are people that have chosen not to have children, for whatever reason. There are people who want to have children who cannot. How dare you! You never had a baby. Your wife had a baby, but you never had a baby, so you know nothing about this,\" Goldberg said after playing a clip of Vance. \"Women, you heard how he thinks of you. This is not good for you, JD.\"\n\nVance, whose unpopularity as a candidate is historic amongst vice presidential nominees, has also been criticized for his comments against divorce, even in the case of violence, and his assertion that exceptions for rape or incest in an abortion ban were \"inconvenient.\"\n\nCo-host Joy Behar, who quipped that Vance was \"mean to the cats,\" asked what the GOP's problem with animals was, referring to once-Veep-frontrunner Kristi Noem's killing of her dog.\n\nBehar also questioned whether, amid reports that Trump is already regretting his pick in Vance, the former president could ever get over Vance's past remarks that Trump was \"America's Hitler.\"\n\nCohost Sara Haines also slammed the comments, asking why Vance suggested that politics should only be viewed through the lens of children when adults grapple with policy outcomes, too.\n\n\"He thinks by the fact that you have children, that's how you look through the lens of politics. I have children, and I can assure you that that's not my first thought when I think about politics,\" Haines said. \"My kids are gonna, obviously, be affected by that, but anybody with a heart will look at the moral clarity of the decisions we're making here.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whoopi Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Andel_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Van Andel Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Women without children took to the platform to point out the constant criticism they've faced over their decision to remain childfree. Some people aptly noted that just because they didn't have children doesn't mean they're unable to make decisions about the future of the US.\n\nAmerican actor Liz Vassey, known for her roles on All My Children and on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, sarcastically replied to Vance's comments: \"I had absolutely no idea I was miserable. Thank God there was a man around to tell me.\"\n\nAnother childfree person posted on X: \"As a non-birth giver, I've heard judgments about this since my 20s, but this thing about having no stake in society unless you produce young is very sinister to me.\"\n\n\"I choose not to have kids and I've never regretted it. I'm not lacking anything and my life is quite full, thank you very much,\" a third woman wrote. \"You're just a miserable little man who gets off by saying one outrageous thing after another.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some noted that people may remain childfree due to health reasons out of their control.\n\n\"Hi, childless cat lady here,\" wrote screenwriter Taryn Hillin. \"Cancer took my uterus and ovaries so I cannot have children (biologically). Navigating the US healthcare system is a nightmare. My dream is for all patients, regardless of income, to have equal access to life-saving treatment.\"\n\n\"Do people even realize that some women have some very tragic and traumatized reasons they don't have children?\" another person asked. \"Yes, for many it is a choice and we should support that. But talk like this is actually very hurtful to those who wish they had the choice.\"\n\nThere has been a growing number of adults in the US who have decided to be childfree. A 2021 survey from the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of adults said it is \"not too or not at all likely\" that they will have children someday, a seven percent increase from 2018. While there was no single reason why a number of Americans have lost interest in becoming parents, some survey respondents cited financial burdens or the unsettling \"state of the world\" as reasons to remain childfree.\n\nOf course, it was important for many users to point out that Harris actually has two step-children. The US vice president is married to longtime entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff, and is a step-mother to his biological children: Ella and Cole Emhoff.\n\nHarris previously opened up about being a stepmother to Ella and Cole in a personal essay for Elle. In honor of Mother's Day 2019, Harris described her step-children as her \"endless source of love and pure joy.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old potential Democratic nominee detailed the moment she met her now-husband's children for the first time, writing: \"Children need consistency; I didn't want to insert myself into their lives as a temporary fixture because I didn't want to disappoint them.\"\n\nShe referred to her step-children as \"brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults.\"\n\n\"I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in,\" Harris wrote. Her step-children even given her the affectionate nickname of \"Momala,\" rather than step-mother.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meredith_clark@yahoo.com", "name": "Meredith Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_childlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voluntary childlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Children", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All My Children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer and Support", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Childfree", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Childfree", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Children", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Children", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/94665e5aee2fa18ad572be43efb7ceeb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The children who come from these families have no real representative in our democracy. Why don't we change that?\"\n\nALSO READ: How much access did $50,000 buy someone at the Republican National Convention?\n\n\"Now some people will say this is radical and this is crazy,\" Vance added. \"The Democrats are talking about giving the vote to 16-year-olds but let's do this instead: Let's give votes to all children in this country but let's give control over those votes to the parents of those children.\"\n\nThe Ohio Republican reiterated that same point a few days later in that now-infamous \"childless cat ladies\" interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, when he identified vice president Kamala Harris, transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as members of the \"childless left.\"\n\n\"Why have we let the Democrat party become controlled by people who don't have children, and why is this just a normal fact of American life that the leaders of our country should be people who don't have a personal and direct stake in it via their own offspring, via their own children and grandchildren,\" Vance said in that 2021 interview.\n\nThe resurfacing of his remarks about giving parents more electoral power opened up Donald Trump's running mate to another round of criticism.\n\n\"There's something SO weird about 'smug' parents who act like having kids is an accomplishment,\" said A.J.

Vance's family fears: Smearing those who don't have children is childish", "body": "Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance thought it was decent and conservative to launch withering attacks on leaders in public life who've had no children.\n\nIn July 2021, before he held office, he told Tucker Carlson, \"We are effectively run in this country...by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too. It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\" He asked: \"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nWhere to begin? We can quickly get past the fact that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and his husband in August 2021 adopted twin babies. And the fact that Harris has two stepchildren with Doug Emhoff. And the fact that AOC is just 34 years old and has plenty of time to become a mom if she wishes to.\n\nAnd the fact that the vast majority of Democratic leaders past and present are fathers and mothers: Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Bill and Hillary Clinton and governors from Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan to Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania to Wes Moore of Maryland to Gavin Newsom of California. Anyone who asserts with a straight face that \"the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children\" has an abusive relationship with the truth.\n\nBut stop and dissect the nasty insult that someone without children lacks a stake in the future of the country.\n\nGeorge Washington had no children. Did the literal father of the United States lack a stake in America's future? Stop laughing.\n\nEd Koch had no children. Did one of New York City's most consequential modern mayors lack a stake in the future of New York City? The notion is patently ridiculous.\n\nAngela Merkel has no children. Did Germany's most consequential modern leader have a miserable life and therefore set about to make the rest of her nation miserable?\n\nNor does having offspring correlate in any way, shape or form to the quality of a person's character or leadership. Donald Trump has five children from three separate marriages. He's been held civilly liable for sexual abuse. He added more to the national debt than any president in U.S. history, a clear sign of disrespect for future generations.\n\nVance, like Trump, is so desperate to ignite new culture wars that set Americans against Americans that he looks for any potential rift to explain why \"they\" are alien to \"us,\" and why \"they\" are to blame for all \"our\" problems. It's ironic because a big message of his bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" is that facile political blame games are facile and self-destructive.\n\nIn the book, Vance is honest about the fact that the family he grew up in, mired in poverty and beset by drug addiction and alcohol abuse and chronic irresponsibility, made its own bad choices.\n\nThe introspective, relatively honest man who wrote that 2016 memoir has vanished.

Women without children took to the platform to point out the constant criticism they've faced over their decision to remain childfree. Some people aptly noted that just because they didn't have children doesn't mean they're unable to make decisions about the future of the US.\n\nAmerican actor Liz Vassey, known for her roles on All My Children and on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, sarcastically replied to Vance's comments: \"I had absolutely no idea I was miserable. Thank God there was a man around to tell me.\"\n\nAnother childfree person posted on X: \"As a non-birth giver, I've heard judgments about this since my 20s, but this thing about having no stake in society unless you produce young is very sinister to me.\"\n\n\"I choose not to have kids and I've never regretted it. I'm not lacking anything and my life is quite full, thank you very much,\" a third woman wrote. \"You're just a miserable little man who gets off by saying one outrageous thing after another.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some noted that people may remain childfree due to health reasons out of their control.\n\n\"Hi, childless cat lady here,\" wrote screenwriter Taryn Hillin. \"Cancer took my uterus and ovaries so I cannot have children (biologically). Navigating the US healthcare system is a nightmare. My dream is for all patients, regardless of income, to have equal access to life-saving treatment.\"\n\n\"Do people even realize that some women have some very tragic and traumatized reasons they don't have children?\" another person asked. \"Yes, for many it is a choice and we should support that. But talk like this is actually very hurtful to those who wish they had the choice.\"\n\nThere has been a growing number of adults in the US who have decided to be childfree. A 2021 survey from the Pew Research Center found that 44 percent of adults said it is \"not too or not at all likely\" that they will have children someday, a seven percent increase from 2018. While there was no single reason why a number of Americans have lost interest in becoming parents, some survey respondents cited financial burdens or the unsettling \"state of the world\" as reasons to remain childfree.\n\nOf course, it was important for many users to point out that Harris actually has two step-children. The US vice president is married to longtime entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff, and is a step-mother to his biological children: Ella and Cole Emhoff.\n\nHarris previously opened up about being a stepmother to Ella and Cole in a personal essay for Elle. In honor of Mother's Day 2019, Harris described her step-children as her \"endless source of love and pure joy.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old potential Democratic nominee detailed the moment she met her now-husband's children for the first time, writing: \"Children need consistency; I didn't want to insert myself into their lives as a temporary fixture because I didn't want to disappoint them.\"\n\nShe referred to her step-children as \"brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults.\"\n\n\"I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in,\" Harris wrote. Her step-children even given her the affectionate nickname of \"Momala,\" rather than step-mother.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_childlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voluntary childlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Children", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All My Children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/24/18/kamala-harris-childfree.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759003", "eventUri": "eng-9759003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

He was supposed to convince independent and undecided voters that he was not the angry and bitter victim that he displays on social media, but a real leader who can unite a polarized electorate.\n\nIt lasted for about 30 minutes -- until he went off script, and took off on a rant that lasted for another hour, returning to his stump speech lies, embracing his victimhood, boring even his adoring audience in the room, not to mention the millions of Americans watching at home, proving once again that a pathological narcissist cannot control himself.\n\nThis is what his former vice president, Mike Pence, had to say about President Joe Biden's exit from the race:\n\n\"President Joe Biden made the right decision for our country and I thank him for putting the interests of our Nation ahead of his own. After the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden's decision to end his campaign, now is a time for leaders in both parties to project calm and send a message of strength and resolve to America's friends and enemies alike that, whatever the state of our politics, the American people are strong and our American military stands ready to defend our freedom and our vital national interests anywhere in the world.\"\n\nThis is what Donald Trump had to say Monday morning on Truth Social: \"It's a new day and Joe Biden doesn't remember quitting the race yesterday!\"\n\nHe then proceeded to rant and rave about the man he is no longer running against, calling Biden \"incompetent,\" forgetful, anti-democratic, unfit to serve as commander in chief and \"the Worst President in the history of the United States.\" He proceeded to dive into conspiracy theories, claiming twice that Biden never really had Covid and was just using it as an excuse to exit the race, effectively accusing both the president and the White House physician of lying. He argued that Democrats \"stole the race from Biden after he won it in the primaries,\" even as the delegates who were elected in those primaries were lining up behind Kamala Harris, his choice and theirs, to top the ticket.\n\nAny chance Trump has of getting a bounce from his unity convention has gone up in smoke. Any chance he had of capitalizing on his show of strength in the face of an assassin's bullet (as compared to the visibly frail Biden, shown on a split screen during the convention, carefully making his way down Air Force One's steps after landing in Delaware to isolate himself) has been wiped away.\n\nTrump is now the bitter old man in this race. The press, having belatedly and then brutally focused on Biden's cognition and health, will now turn the microscope on the man who can't control himself. In the meantime, as Harris cements the nomination, a clip of Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, attacking her as a \"childless cat lady\" has gone viral. Asked by Tucker Carlson about his views on the \"childless left\" in 2021, Vance answered:\n\n\"We are effectively run in this country ... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too.

The man whose face is on the one-dollar bill (and who has a, let's admit it, rather phallic monument) was not a biological parent. He did, however, become stepfather to Martha's children when he married her, and he helped raise Martha Washington's two children from a previous marriage, as well as her four grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews.\n\nBut that's not good enough for JD (\"Junior Devil\") Vance. J.D. Vance said Kamala Harris has no kids. Stepparents would like a word (WaPo).\n\nIn a video drawn from a 2021 interview on Fox News's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" J.D. Vance, now the GOP vice-presidential nominee, said that Harris and other prominent Democrats (including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) \"don't really have a direct stake\" in the country's future because they are \"people without children.\" In the clip, which has amassed more than 25 million views since it was shared Monday on X,\n\nVance also refers to Democrats as \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made.\"\n\nSo now we have to take down the Washington Monument and rename the nation's capital (\"Trumptown\"?) and take the Father of Our Country off our currency, because it turns out he wasn't really a father, just a stepfather. Others on the right have echoed Vance's argument: Will Chamberlain, a conservative commentator and former Ron DeSantis staffer, posted on X on Sunday that a \"really simple, underdiscussed reason why Kamala Harris shouldn't be President\" is that she has \"no children.\"\n\nWashington wasn't the only president to have no biological children of his own.\n\nMadison, Jackson, Polk, Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Harding*, and Hoover also had no children, though most had stepchildren. (For some reason, Jackson isn't on that list, so see here.) So now we also have to change the $20 bill (which we ought to do anyway; whatever happened to replacing Jackson with Harriet Tubman?)...\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/7/24/2257765/-Hey-Vance-George-Washington-Only-Had-Stepchilidren", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

But even if you have, it's worth revisiting the full quote -- and reminding yourself of what it says about the movement that may wind up in charge of this country after this year's election.\n\nIn 2021, while running for the Senate, Vance explained what he saw as one of the biggest problems facing America: It's being run \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\" He name-checked, among others, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIt's a statement, as my colleague Jessica Grose writes, that shows the desperation of Republicans who are still \"clinging to the tag line that the G.O.P. is the pro-family party.\" But even for a red-meat, red-state Senate candidate, this was a remarkably harsh -- and conspiracy-minded -- insult to a large number of people: Around one in six American women 40 to 44 have never had children. It's the kind of comment that makes you wonder if Vance thinks that he has been nominated by the Republican Party to serve as the vice president of the Republic of Gilead.\n\nSorry -- yes -- Vance knows that our nation is still called the United States of America. But there's a real \"Handmaid's Tale\" vibe to a lot of what we're hearing from the right.\n\nFirst, my main point: As Vance's statement illustrates, many people who call themselves conservatives -- and who, routinely, as Donald Trump did on Wednesday, accuse moderately center-left Democrats like Harris of being \"radical\" -- are actually the real radicals. That is, they seemingly can't stand America as it is and want to transform it back into a kind of society we haven't been for generations. This is especially true when it comes to gender roles.\n\nModern America is by no means free of sexism.

Vance's \"Childless Cat Ladies\" Comment Scratches the Surface of His Disdain for People without Kids", "body": "Back in my church-going days, I remember sitting through a Mother's Day sermon from the church's assistant pastor, and getting so angry I wondered if people could see the cartoon steam puffing out from my ears. The young father of four was preaching about how it was the duty of women not just to have children but to have lots of children. I knew there were women in our congregation who'd struggled with infertility and others who'd chosen not to have kids or who were happy to be single, and I could only imagine how hurtful his words were.\n\nThe arrogance and audacity of that pastor stayed with me for decades and was the first thing popped into my mind when I heard Vance's recently resurfaced quote that, \"We are effectively run in this country ... by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nThe fact that he name-checked both Kamala Harris (who has two step-children) and Pete Buttigieg (who has two adopted children), just made it worse, somehow claiming that they don't have the same stake in our country because they don't have biological kids.\n\nAnd in case anyone thought this was an off-the-cuff, isolated remark, here is JD Vance speaking to Intercollegiate Studies Institute in 2021 and making it clear that he has a particular disregard for anyone without kids.\n\n\"Let's give votes to all kids in this country, but let's give those votes to the parents of those children,\" he proposes. \"When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don't have kids. Let's face the consequences and the reality. If you don't have as much as an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice.\"\n\n\"People will say -- and I'm sure The Atlantic and The Washington Post will criticize me in the coming days -- but, 'Doesn't this mean that non-parents don't have as much a voice as parents? Doesn't this mean that parents have a bigger say in how our democracy functions?' Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nThis, to me, is scarier than his dumb \"childless cat ladies\" comment, and confirms that his devaluing of adults without kids runs as deep as that idiot assistant pastor decades ago. And this was the heart of his address, not some aside.\n\nEarlier in the speech he says, \"I want to take aim at the left, specifically the childless left because I think the rejection of the American family is perhaps the most pernicious and most evil thing the left has done in the country.\"\n\n\"I might get in trouble for this, but I'm going to ask the question anyone,\" he continues. \"Consider all of the next gen of the Democrat party. ... The names are obvious, they're well-known people, Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- he's now the Secretary of Transportation -- Cory Booker, AOC. Think of all these people. They're different, they come from different walks of life, different parts of the country. What is the one thing that unites all these people? Not a single one of them has any children.\"\n\nAnd lest you think it's just politicians without children he disdains, he continues to complain about \"What you find consistently is that most of the unhappy and most miserable and most angry people in our media are childless adults. Let's just be honest about it.\"\n\nWell, unlike the childless father of our nation, George Washington, I happen to have three children, which makes me no more or less worthy to report on the asinine things coming out of the Republican vice-presidential nominee than anyone else.\n\nKids are great, and I love being a father. But the idea that my opinion about anything somehow mattered more when my kids were little or ever mattered more than someone without kids is the kind of fringe thinking that used to be disqualifying for a major American political party's VP candidate. And I have a feeling that it won't sit well with the millions of Americans who either decided not to or couldn't have kids.

JD Vance's resurfaced attack on Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats as \"childless cat ladies.\" But it fits right into one House candidate's playbook.\n\n\"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married,\" Blake Masters, a venture capitalist locked in a tight race for an Arizona House seat, wrote Wednesday on X. \"If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations? Skin in the game matters.\"\n\nThe post, referencing a headline about Vance's 2021 comments to Fox News' Tucker Carlson, quickly went viral. It came as Masters battles Abe Hamadeh to succeed outgoing Rep. Debbie Lesko in a Republican primary next week in Arizona's deep-red 8th Congressional District. Masters has been endorsed by Vance, while his opponent has the backing of Vance's running mate, former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump endorsed Masters during his failed 2022 Senate campaign, and he's still coasting off of it. Earlier this month, Masters ran an ad touting the former president's endorsement, and Trump's campaign has reportedly urged Masters to pull it.\n\nMasters' rhetoric about family isn't new. \"I've got a wonderful wife. I've got four beautiful boys. That's called skin in the game. ... What we don't need is someone with no wife and kids, no skin in the game,\" he said in April, referring to Hamadeh.\n\nMasters' campaign has also aired an attack ad showing Hamadeh -- whose parents immigrated from Syria -- wearing an ihram in Mecca and calling him an \"anchor baby.\"\n\nVance's comments, which began recirculating after he was named Trump's running mate at the Republican National Convention, came from a 2021 interview when he was campaigning for an Ohio Senate seat. Vance called Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nHarris has two step-children who have rushed to quell that attack. \"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I \ud83e\udd14,\" step-daughter Ella Emhoff wrote Thursday on Instagram. \"I love my three parents.\"\n\nButtigieg adopted twins in August 2021.\n\nHarris' campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, it posted a clip on X of Vance at a speech saying: \"When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power, you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don't have kids.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The action begins July 24 with coverage of soccer games on USA.\n\nThe additions are expected to add new reasons to tune into the primetime broadcasts, when NBC and Peacock have already shown the events live during the day.\n\nThe three-hour nightly \"curated presentation,\" as Executive Producer Molly Solomon calls it, will recap each day's top performances on NBC and include a host of extras.\n\n\"We're going to be blasting off with 'Gold Medals' at 7 p.m. and then we're going to infuse our storytelling with more behind-the-scenes access, more athlete-generated content and more onscreen technology that will help the viewer appreciate these magnificent athletes,\" Solomon says. \"You may know what happened but we're going to tell you why it happened and advance the story in primetime.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

A lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation but this is a chance for the world to be on one page. It's like a peace offering.\"\n\nBecause Snoop has a wide fan base (and a beat of his own), he plans to shake up something that's very traditional, \"bringing my flavor. We're just having fun.\"\n\nRowdy Gaines, an Olympic gold medal winner in swimming and longtime NBC commentator, says the Games are a way to give athletes who don't have a Super Bowl or World Series a bit of the spotlight. \"It's a four-year journey,\" he says. It represents \"the pinnacle of our success.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSnoop, he adds, may spend years producing a record \"and when you put a record together, you're all in.\"\n\nThe key, Snoop Dogg says, is to work hard. \"To be an Olympic athlete takes a lot. I look forward to being around them. I've been working out myself,\" he jokes, \"so in case they need a hand or a foot or an arm, I'm available.\"\n\nWhile professionals like Gaines will handle the calls (many of them at the venues, not at U.S. locations), the celebrities will get to share their reactions to the results.\n\nA group of social media influencers, Solomon says, will help tell the story in a different way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of different flavors of our social coverage. Each night, it'll be pushed to primetime.\"\n\nIf a story breaks during the Olympics, Solomon's team will be ready to react quickly. \"We have like 10 ENG crews just ready to respond to the next great story,\" she says. \"We're ready to pivot, but it all starts with a great plan.\"\n\nWhile live coverage is exciting, \"it don't matter where you're at,\" Snoop Dogg says.\n\n\"You got the spirit...you do what you do, from the living room, from the broadcast booth.\"\n\nBecause of the six-hour time difference between the United States and Paris, most events will occur during the afternoon here. From 1 to 4 p.m. central time, marquee events will take place. Then, in the evening, viewers who aren't home during the day will get the recaps.\n\n\"We're going to be at 243 live hours on NBC,\" Solomon says. \"That lets us make sure we're going to reach the broadest possible audience with this Olympics.\"\n\nThe three hours of \"turnaround time,\" she adds, will let producers talk to families, coaches and athletes to \"advance the stories.

That's where we come in. (Hint for cord-cutters: Peacock.)\n\nAnother valuable resource is USA TODAY's mega-guide to watching the Olympic Games. But here are six streamlined tips to help you figure out how you want to watch the Games.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nHow to use Peacock to watch Paris Olympics\n\nThe full might of NBCUniversal is behind broadcasting the 2024 Olympics. That includes its streaming service, Peacock. All 5,000 hours of Olympics coverage -- including every single one of the 329 medal events -- are available via Peacock. But the app's personalization preferences allow fans to create their ideal Olympic viewing format - with plenty of useful features. Examples of those features include:\n\nPeacock will the place to find alternative streaming options such as \"Gold Zone,\" \"Watch with Alex Cooper\" and \"Olympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson.\"\n\nThere will be hubs for every sport and updated medal standings, as well as a search feature and interactive schedule.\n\nHow to watch Paris Olympics in primetime\n\nFor those who appreciate their Olympics with a side of drama and storytelling, NBC's \"Primetime in Paris\" will be the preferred option. Olympic host Mike Tirico will welcome viewers with the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Coverage will typically begin with a Team USA gold-medal performance and this is where Snoop Dogg will be making his appearances on behalf on NBC. Studio analysts can dive deeper into topics, while highlights from throughout the day will be shown. The primetime broadcast will begin at 8 p.m. ET nightly until the closing ceremony on Aug. 11.\n\nHow to watch Paris Olympics live in the US\n\nThat said, if you are a results-oriented consumer of sports, perhaps tuning into the live action is more suitable. Again, every event is available live at any given moment, and that includes potentially streaming exclusively on Peacock or NBCOlympics.com with cable verification. The higher-profile events will be held at night, typically, putting them roughly between 2-5 p.m. ET (although not a steadfast rule). Keep those hours clear.\n\nWhere to find NBC Olympics broadcast schedule\n\nFor non-Peacock users, NBC has published its tentative TV listings. Keep that page handy, even if it's subject to change, to give you a general idea of what's happening when and where to find it.\n\nWhat is NBC's 'Gold Zone' for Olympics?\n\nOnce the action in Paris begins, it never stops. As many as 40 events could be happening at the same time. NBC is trying to ride the wave of \"NFL RedZone\" and created \"Gold Zone\" for Paris, and the whip-around show will actually feature Scott Hanson. \"Gold Zone\" streams live on Peacock from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET from July 27-Aug. 10.

Each night, it'll be pushed to primetime.\"\n\nIf a story breaks during the Olympics, Solomon's team will be ready to react quickly. \"We have like 10 ENG crews just ready to respond to the next great story,\" she says. \"We're ready to pivot, but it all starts with a great plan.\"\n\nWhile live coverage is exciting, \"it don't matter where you're at,\" Snoop Dogg says.\n\n\"You got the spirit...you do what you do, from the living room, from the broadcast booth.\"\n\nBecause of the six-hour time difference between the United States and Paris, most events will occur during the afternoon here. From 1 to 4 p.m. central time, marquee events will take place. Then, in the evening, viewers who aren't home during the day will get the recaps.\n\n\"We're going to be at 243 live hours on NBC,\" Solomon says. \"That lets us make sure we're going to reach the broadest possible audience with this Olympics.\"\n\nThe three hours of \"turnaround time,\" she adds, will let producers talk to families, coaches and athletes to \"advance the stories. Imagine if Snoop was also at the venue. We can weave all that into the storytelling.\"\n\nComplete coverage of the Summer Olympics begins July 26 on NBC and Peacock.\n\nBruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.\n\nBe the first to

The action begins July 24 with coverage of soccer games on USA.\n\nThe additions are expected to add new reasons to tune into the primetime broadcasts, when NBC and Peacock have already shown the events live during the day.\n\nThe three-hour nightly \"curated presentation,\" as Executive Producer Molly Solomon calls it, will recap each day's top performances on NBC and include a host of extras.\n\n\"We're going to be blasting off with 'Gold Medals' at 7 p.m. and then we're going to infuse our storytelling with more behind-the-scenes access, more athlete-generated content and more onscreen technology that will help the viewer appreciate these magnificent athletes,\" Solomon says. \"You may know what happened but we're going to tell you why it happened and advance the story in primetime.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

A lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation but this is a chance for the world to be on one page. It's like a peace offering.\"\n\nBecause Snoop has a wide fan base (and a beat of his own), he plans to shake up something that's very traditional, \"bringing my flavor. We're just having fun.\"\n\nRowdy Gaines, an Olympic gold medal winner in swimming and longtime NBC commentator, says the Games are a way to give athletes who don't have a Super Bowl or World Series a bit of the spotlight. \"It's a four-year journey,\" he says. It represents \"the pinnacle of our success.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSnoop, he adds, may spend years producing a record \"and when you put a record together, you're all in.\"\n\nThe key, Snoop Dogg says, is to work hard. \"To be an Olympic athlete takes a lot. I look forward to being around them. I've been working out myself,\" he jokes, \"so in case they need a hand or a foot or an arm, I'm available.\"\n\nWhile professionals like Gaines will handle the calls (many of them at the venues, not at U.S. locations), the celebrities will get to share their reactions to the results.\n\nA group of social media influencers, Solomon says, will help tell the story in a different way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of different flavors of our social coverage.

It's like a peace offering.\"\n\nBecause Snoop has a wide fan base (and a beat of his own), he plans to shake up something that's very traditional, \"bringing my flavor. We're just having fun.\"\n\nRowdy Gaines, an Olympic gold medal winner in swimming and longtime NBC commentator, says the Games are a way to give athletes who don't have a Super Bowl or World Series a bit of the spotlight. \"It's a four-year journey,\" he says. It represents \"the pinnacle of our success.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSnoop, he adds, may spend years producing a record \"and when you put a record together, you're all in.\"\n\nThe key, Snoop Dogg says, is to work hard. \"To be an Olympic athlete takes a lot. I look forward to being around them. I've been working out myself,\" he jokes, \"so in case they need a hand or a foot or an arm, I'm available.\"\n\nWhile professionals like Gaines will handle the calls (many of them at the venues, not at U.S. locations), the celebrities will get to share their reactions to the results.\n\nA group of social media influencers, Solomon says, will help tell the story in a different way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of different flavors of our social coverage. Each night, it'll be pushed to primetime.\"\n\nIf a story breaks during the Olympics, Solomon's team will be ready to react quickly. \"We have like 10 ENG crews just ready to respond to the next great story,\" she says. \"We're ready to pivot, but it all starts with a great plan.\"\n\nWhile live coverage is exciting, \"it don't matter where you're at,\" Snoop Dogg says.\n\n\"You got the spirit...you do what you do, from the living room, from the broadcast booth.\"\n\nBecause of the six-hour time difference between the United States and Paris, most events will occur during the afternoon here. From 1 to 4 p.m. central time, marquee events will take place. Then, in the evening, viewers who aren't home during the day will get the recaps.\n\n\"We're going to be at 243 live hours on NBC,\" Solomon says. \"That lets us make sure we're going to reach the broadest possible audience with this Olympics.\"\n\nThe three hours of \"turnaround time,\" she adds, will let producers talk to families, coaches and athletes to \"advance the stories.

The action begins July 24 with coverage of soccer games on USA.\n\nThe additions are expected to add new reasons to tune into the primetime broadcasts, when NBC and Peacock have already shown the events live during the day.\n\nThe three-hour nightly \"curated presentation,\" as Executive Producer Molly Solomon calls it, will recap each day's top performances on NBC and include a host of extras.\n\n\"We're going to be blasting off with 'Gold Medals' at 7 p.m. and then we're going to infuse our storytelling with more behind-the-scenes access, more athlete-generated content and more onscreen technology that will help the viewer appreciate these magnificent athletes,\" Solomon says. \"You may know what happened but we're going to tell you why it happened and advance the story in primetime.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

A lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation but this is a chance for the world to be on one page.

Officially dubbed \"NBC Sports: 2024 Paris Olympics,\" the network coverage will run live all day with a compilation of highlights and interviews during prime time.\n\nThe massive NBC coverage is helmed by Molly Solomon. As executive producer and president of Olympics production, the buck stops with her. \"I'm going to get promoted or fired. One or the other,\" she jokes.\n\nNo chance of that. Solomon started her NBC Olympics coverage in 1990 as a researcher for the Barcelona Games and has worked nearly every Olympics since.\n\n\"I remember where I was seven years ago, when I heard that Paris was going to host the Olympics and Paralympics, and I was thrilled then,\" she said.\n\n\"But ... I don't think I've ever been more excited about an Olympics. This will be my 13th Games, and we are keenly aware that this truly will be a Games that none of us has seen before. The historic landmarks of one of the world's most beautiful cities is actually going to be the backdrop for the 17 days of this incredible competition,\" she explains.\n\n\"Some of these famous sites actually will be Olympic venues. These Summer Olympics, thank goodness, are going to return (after COVID) with joy, spectacle, and crowds, so you'll see friends, families and fans back in the seats, and that really is providing the excitement and energy that the viewers expect when they watch the Olympics.\"\n\nWhat they're probably not going to expect is rapper Snoop Dogg as a lively roving commentator. The 52-year-old gained some attention when he served as commentator on the dressage competition during the Tokyo Olympics. But he was not on-site then.\n\nThis time he will be, though they haven't quite determined what to call his new avocation.\n\n\"I think what it's going to be, it's going to be me actually in the field at events -- hosting, getting with the athletes, moving through the city. Just doing the things that Snoop Dogg does,\" he said.\n\n\"We're planning on shaking it up in many different ways, bringing my flavor. And then at the same time, just having fun. Because it's the Olympics, y'all, this is the biggest sporting event every four years. We only get it once every four years, so we're going to make the most of it.\"\n\nSolomon said she spoke with Snoop Dog about filling this role a year ago. \"And what I was so struck by was the passion, the genuine passion, that (he has) for the athletes.\"\n\nThe singer-celeb, who's known for his quirky appearances with chum Martha Stewart, said he has followed the Olympics ever since he first caught them when he was 13.\n\n\"I think it's very special because it's a time where the whole world can come together and cheer for their countries, cheer for certain athletes. And then at the same time, we come together as one -- as America,\" he said.\n\n\"And a lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation. But this is a chance for the world to be on one page, for everybody to be together, to cheer for each other, to root for each other. So it's actually a peace offering that I feel like. I'm honored to be here because I always represent peace. I love sports, I love the Olympics. And for me to be a part of it is only going to make it more peaceful and more passionate.\"\n\nAccording to Solomon, NBCUniversal plans to be no-holds-barred in its coverage.\"We're going to be live all day on NBC. So the 'Today' show will be in Paris from 7 to 9 a.m., and then we will come out and go from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, live on NBC. And that allows us to be truly live because ... of the time difference, it's six hours,\" she said.\n\n\"So everything is happening all day long. So from 2 to 5 p.m. in the afternoon, Eastern Time, is almost like prime-time live in the afternoon. You'll have swimming, gymnastics, and track and field finals on NBC.\"\n\nThe network's streaming stepchild, Peacock, is going to spread its tail too.\n\nAccording to Solomon, \"Peacock will be the greatest single Olympics destination in U.S. media history. We're going to be incorporating all the lessons that we've learned from the last two Olympics and really every moment, every medal, every network and cable simulcast will be shown on Peacock.\"", "source": {"uri": "sentinelsource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SentinelSource.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simulcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7819b5a8-f0c2-11ec-85c6-cff09f7b972a.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739975", "eventUri": "eng-9739975", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 77, "textEnd": 84}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Unless you plan to be in the City of Light for the Games, you'll need NBC's streaming service to watch all of the events live in the US. And at just $8 a month, Peacock is a much more affordable way to watch the Olympics than a trip to Paris.\n\nIf you're already at your limit in terms of streaming subscriptions and refuse to sign up for Peacock, then you'll be able to watch much of the Olympics across NBC's family of channels -- NBC, USA Network, E!, CNBC and Golf Channel -- with cable or satellite TV or a live TV streaming service.\n\nBelow, we outline the Olympic TV schedule and provide recommendations for the best streaming services for watching the Games in the US, as well as international viewing options for Canada, Australia and the UK.\n\nParis is hosting the 2024 Summer Games. It's the third time the Olympics have been in Paris but the first since 1924.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics begin on Friday, July 26 and conclude on Sunday, Aug. 11.\n\nThe opening ceremony starts at 7:30 p.m. local time in Paris on Friday, July 26. That's 1:30 p.m. Eastern, 12:30 p.m. Central, 11:30 a.m. Mountain and 10:30 a.m. Pacific in the US. The opening ceremony starts at 6:30 p.m. BST in the UK and 3:30 a.m. AEST on Saturday in Australia.\n\nThe closing ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, Aug. 11, beginning at 8 p.m. local time in Paris after the last event of the Games -- the women's marathon -- concludes. That's 2 p.m. ET in the US, 7 p.m. BST in the UK and 4 a.m. AEST on Monday in Australia\n\nParis is 6 hours ahead of New York and the rest of the Eastern time zone. It's 7 hours ahead of the Central time zone, 8 hours ahead of Mountain time and 9 hours ahead of Pacific time.\n\nThis difference means that most events will be shown live in the morning and afternoon for US viewers.\n\nWithout question, it's Peacock. Even after a price hike coming this week that raises the monthly charge from $6 to $8 a month, Peacock is one of the most affordable streaming services. And it will let you watch any event live. NBC states that Peacock will stream 5,000 hours of live coverage throughout the Games, including all 329 medal events.\n\nIn addition to live streaming each event, Peacock will have a whip-around show, Gold Zone, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET each day. And if you're watching an event on Gold Zone that you're really into, you can continue to watch it even if Gold Zone cuts away to something else. Peacock will display Live Action on-screen prompts that will let you stay with the event or follow Gold Zone's coverage.\n\nPeacock will also have four multiview options that will let you watch four events at once. You'll be able to watch NBC's nightly Primetime in Paris show on Peacock, and Peacock will have its own daily recap show \"hosted\" by AI Al Michaels.\n\nNope, you can watch the Games on TV, but Peacock will give you greater control on which events to watch.\n\nThere are five TV channels you need for the Olympics: NBC, USA Network, E!, CNBC, and Golf Channel. Here's the breakdown for how coverage will be split across them:\n\nUSA Network will show US team sports including soccer, basketball and 3x3 basketball as well as swimming, track and field, beach volleyball, rugby, cycling, volleyball and water polo.\n\nCNBC will show boxing, cycling, rugby, skateboarding and more.\n\nE! will feature coverage of track and field, gymnastics, canoeing, diving, equestrian, artistic swimming, breaking, fencing and water polo. That's right, break dancing is an Olympic sport and will make its debut in Paris.\n\nThe men's and women's golf competitions, naturally, will be shown on the Golf Channel.\n\nNBC will broadcast its Primetime in Paris show each evening in the US. The show is hosted by Mike Tirico and includes reports from Snoop Dogg.\n\nSling TV is the most affordable option if you live in one of the few markets where it offers NBC. Failing that, YouTube is the best service for the Olympics because it offers all five channels you'll need in its base plan that costs $73.\n\nIf Sling takes conditional gold medal and YouTube TV gets the silver among live TV streaming services for watching the Olympics, then Hulu with Live TV is awarded the bronze. It costs only $4 more per month than YouTube TV and includes all five channels for watching the Olympics.\n\nRead more: Best sports streaming service for 2024\n\nAnd with a live TV streaming subscription (or cable/satellite plan), you'll be able to authenticate yourself as a pay TV subscriber to watch live streams of every event on NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, the NBC app or the NBC Olympics app. That's a great option if you don't want to sign up for Peacock and want to pick and choose which events to watch.\n\nAll of the live TV streaming services above allow you to cancel anytime and require a solid internet connection. Looking for more information? Check out our live TV streaming services guide.\n\nIf you find yourself unable to view the Olympics locally, you may need a different way to watch the games -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\n\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\n\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\n\nBBC will broadcast the 2024 Games on its free-to-air channels BBC One and BBC Two. It promises more than 250 hours of live coverage across the two channels. And you can also livestream all the action from Paris on the BBC iPlayer.\n\nAussies can watch the Olympics on more than 40 free-to-air channels on the Nine Network. And you can watch on on-demand highlights on the network's streaming service 9Now.\n\nMeanwhile, pay-TV service Stan Sport will show all 329 Olympic events ad-free and in 4K Ultra HD.\n\nIn Canada, the Games will be broadcast on TV channels CBC, TSN and Sportsnet. And they will be shown on the free CBC Gem streaming service.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The action begins July 24 with coverage of soccer games on USA.\n\nThe additions are expected to add new reasons to tune into the primetime broadcasts, when NBC and Peacock have already shown the events live during the day.\n\nThe three-hour nightly \"curated presentation,\" as Executive Producer Molly Solomon calls it, will recap each day's top performances on NBC and include a host of extras.\n\n\"We're going to be blasting off with 'Gold Medals' at 7 p.m. and then we're going to infuse our storytelling with more behind-the-scenes access, more athlete-generated content and more onscreen technology that will help the viewer appreciate these magnificent athletes,\" Solomon says. \"You may know what happened but we're going to tell you why it happened and advance the story in primetime.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

A lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation but this is a chance for the world to be on one page. It's like a peace offering.\"\n\nBecause Snoop has a wide fan base (and a beat of his own), he plans to shake up something that's very traditional, \"bringing my flavor. We're just having fun.\"\n\nRowdy Gaines, an Olympic gold medal winner in swimming and longtime NBC commentator, says the Games are a way to give athletes who don't have a Super Bowl or World Series a bit of the spotlight. \"It's a four-year journey,\" he says. It represents \"the pinnacle of our success.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSnoop, he adds, may spend years producing a record \"and when you put a record together, you're all in.\"\n\nThe key, Snoop Dogg says, is to work hard. \"To be an Olympic athlete takes a lot. I look forward to being around them. I've been working out myself,\" he jokes, \"so in case they need a hand or a foot or an arm, I'm available.\"\n\nWhile professionals like Gaines will handle the calls (many of them at the venues, not at U.S. locations), the celebrities will get to share their reactions to the results.\n\nA group of social media influencers, Solomon says, will help tell the story in a different way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of different flavors of our social coverage. Each night, it'll be pushed to primetime.\"\n\nIf a story breaks during the Olympics, Solomon's team will be ready to react quickly. \"We have like 10 ENG crews just ready to respond to the next great story,\" she says. \"We're ready to pivot, but it all starts with a great plan.\"\n\nWhile live coverage is exciting, \"it don't matter where you're at,\" Snoop Dogg says.\n\n\"You got the spirit...you do what you do, from the living room, from the broadcast booth.\"\n\nBecause of the six-hour time difference between the United States and Paris, most events will occur during the afternoon here. From 1 to 4 p.m. central time, marquee events will take place. Then, in the evening, viewers who aren't home during the day will get the recaps.\n\n\"We're going to be at 243 live hours on NBC,\" Solomon says. \"That lets us make sure we're going to reach the broadest possible audience with this Olympics.\"\n\nThe three hours of \"turnaround time,\" she adds, will let producers talk to families, coaches and athletes to \"advance the stories. Imagine if Snoop was also at the venue. We can weave all that into the storytelling.\"\n\nComplete coverage of the Summer Olympics begins July 26 on NBC and Peacock.\n\nBruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow

The action begins July 24 with coverage of soccer games on USA.\n\nThe additions are expected to add new reasons to tune into the primetime broadcasts, when NBC and Peacock have already shown the events live during the day.\n\nThe three-hour nightly \"curated presentation,\" as Executive Producer Molly Solomon calls it, will recap each day's top performances on NBC and include a host of extras.\n\n\"We're going to be blasting off with 'Gold Medals' at 7 p.m. and then we're going to infuse our storytelling with more behind-the-scenes access, more athlete-generated content and more onscreen technology that will help the viewer appreciate these magnificent athletes,\" Solomon says. \"You may know what happened but we're going to tell you why it happened and advance the story in primetime.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOn Peacock, viewers will get \"every moment, every medal, every network and cable simulcast,\" Solomon says. \"Peacock will be the greatest single Olympics destination in U.S. media history.\"\n\nTranslation: That will be the place for hardcore Olympics fans.\n\nSnoop, meanwhile, will serve as a roving reporter, dropping into venues and talking with athletes and families.\n\n\"It's a time where the whole world can come together and cheer for their countries, cheer for certain athletes,\" says the award-winning rapper. \"At the same time, we come together as one as America. A lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation but this is a chance for the world to be on one page. It's like a peace offering.\"\n\nBecause Snoop has a wide fan base (and a beat of his own), he plans to shake up something that's very traditional, \"bringing my flavor. We're just having fun.\"\n\nRowdy Gaines, an Olympic gold medal winner in swimming and longtime NBC commentator, says the Games are a way to give athletes who don't have a Super Bowl or World Series a bit of the spotlight. \"It's a four-year journey,\" he says. It represents \"the pinnacle of our success.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSnoop, he adds, may spend years producing a record \"and when you put a record together, you're all in.\"\n\nThe key, Snoop Dogg says, is to work hard. \"To be an Olympic athlete takes a lot. I look forward to being around them. I've been working out myself,\" he jokes, \"so in case they need a hand or a foot or an arm, I'm available.\"\n\nWhile professionals like Gaines will handle the calls (many of them at the venues, not at U.S. locations), the celebrities will get to share their reactions to the results.\n\nA group of social media influencers, Solomon says, will help tell the story in a different way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of different flavors of our social coverage. Each night, it'll be pushed to primetime.\"\n\nIf a story breaks during the Olympics, Solomon's team will be ready to react quickly. \"We have like 10 ENG crews just ready to respond to the next great story,\" she says. \"We're ready to pivot, but it all starts with a great plan.\"\n\nWhile live coverage is exciting, \"it don't matter where you're at,\" Snoop Dogg says.\n\n\"You got the spirit...you do what you do, from the living room, from the broadcast booth.\"\n\nBecause of the six-hour time difference between the United States and Paris, most events will occur during the afternoon here. From 1 to 4 p.m. central time, marquee events will take place. Then, in the evening, viewers who aren't home during the day will get the recaps.\n\n\"We're going to be at 243 live hours on NBC,\" Solomon says. \"That lets us make sure we're going to reach the broadest possible audience with this Olympics.\"\n\nThe three hours of \"turnaround time,\" she adds, will let producers talk to families, coaches and athletes to \"advance the stories. Imagine if Snoop was also at the venue. We can weave all that into the storytelling.\"\n\nComplete coverage of the Summer Olympics begins July 26 on NBC and Peacock.\n\nBruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow

Officially dubbed \"NBC Sports: 2024 Paris Olympics,\" the network coverage will run live all day with a compilation of highlights and interviews during prime time.\n\nThe massive NBC coverage is helmed by Molly Solomon. As executive producer and president of Olympics production, the buck stops with her. \"I'm going to get promoted or fired. One or the other,\" she jokes.\n\nNo chance of that. Solomon started her NBC Olympics coverage in 1990 as a researcher for the Barcelona Games and has worked nearly every Olympics since.\n\n\"I remember where I was seven years ago, when I heard that Paris was going to host the Olympics and Paralympics, and I was thrilled then,\" she said.\n\n\"But ... I don't think I've ever been more excited about an Olympics. This will be my 13th Games, and we are keenly aware that this truly will be a Games that none of us has seen before. The historic landmarks of one of the world's most beautiful cities is actually going to be the backdrop for the 17 days of this incredible competition,\" she explains.\n\n\"Some of these famous sites actually will be Olympic venues. These Summer Olympics, thank goodness, are going to return (after COVID) with joy, spectacle, and crowds, so you'll see friends, families and fans back in the seats, and that really is providing the excitement and energy that the viewers expect when they watch the Olympics.\"\n\nWhat they're probably not going to expect is rapper Snoop Dogg as a lively roving commentator. The 52-year-old gained some attention when he served as commentator on the dressage competition during the Tokyo Olympics. But he was not on-site then.\n\nThis time he will be, though they haven't quite determined what to call his new avocation.\n\n\"I think what it's going to be, it's going to be me actually in the field at events -- hosting, getting with the athletes, moving through the city. Just doing the things that Snoop Dogg does,\" he said.\n\n\"We're planning on shaking it up in many different ways, bringing my flavor. And then at the same time, just having fun. Because it's the Olympics, y'all, this is the biggest sporting event every four years. We only get it once every four years, so we're going to make the most of it.\"\n\nSolomon said she spoke with Snoop Dog about filling this role a year ago. \"And what I was so struck by was the passion, the genuine passion, that (he has) for the athletes.\"\n\nThe singer-celeb, who's known for his quirky appearances with chum Martha Stewart, said he has followed the Olympics ever since he first caught them when he was 13.\n\n\"I think it's very special because it's a time where the whole world can come together and cheer for their countries, cheer for certain athletes. And then at the same time, we come together as one -- as America,\" he said.\n\n\"And a lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation. But this is a chance for the world to be on one page, for everybody to be together, to cheer for each other, to root for each other. So it's actually a peace offering that I feel like. I'm honored to be here because I always represent peace. I love sports, I love the Olympics. And for me to be a part of it is only going to make it more peaceful and more passionate.\"\n\nAccording to Solomon, NBCUniversal plans to be no-holds-barred in its coverage.\"We're going to be live all day on NBC. So the 'Today' show will be in Paris from 7 to 9 a.m., and then we will come out and go from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, live on NBC. And that allows us to be truly live because ... of the time difference, it's six hours,\" she said.\n\n\"So everything is happening all day long. So from 2 to 5 p.m. in the afternoon, Eastern Time, is almost like prime-time live in the afternoon. You'll have swimming, gymnastics, and track and field finals on NBC.\"\n\nThe network's streaming stepchild, Peacock, is going to spread its tail too.\n\nAccording to Solomon, \"Peacock will be the greatest single Olympics destination in U.S. media history. We're going to be incorporating all the lessons that we've learned from the last two Olympics and really every moment, every medal, every network and cable simulcast will be shown on Peacock.\"\n\nWolf tries 'Homicide'\n\nProducer Dick Wolf, the father of all those \"Law & Order\" shows, is dipping his toe into documentary series with \"Homicide: Los Angeles,\" premiering on Netflix Tuesday.\n\nThe series will examine true crimes from the city of not-so-many-angels as told by the cops and prosecutors who tracked down the miscreants and indicted them.\n\nWolf, who always prefers the procedural part of his dramas, said, \"I tell stories, and this is an entertainment company. It's not a political action committee ... I've probably spent more time with cops than anybody who doesn't have a badge.\"\n\n\"I like them, 99.8 % of them become cops to help people. And, yeah, there are bad cops. There are people who do bad things, but the overwhelming majority of these people are out there on the street every day putting their lives in danger and not getting paid very much money. They ain't in it for the money. So I don't know. Is that educational or presenting something that, on a personal basis, I sure am glad they're there?\"\n\nNatalie Portman seeks new experiences\n\nAcademy Award-winner Natalie Portman, who earned that golden statue for her performance as the unhinged ballet dancer in \"Black Swan,\" is starring in the new \"Lady in the Lake\" premiering on Apple TV+ Friday. Portman plays a Jewish housewife hoping to change her life in this noir-thriller. This is quite a change from the other roles she's played.\n\n\"I always look at scripts and see if they'll be different,\" she said.\"If you do the same thing over and over again, you don't get new experiences and you don't learn from it. I'm sort of selfish in my choice of project in that I always try and do things that I think will enhance my life more and will give me new experiences, and I'll learn from and become a fuller person from,\" she said.\n\nHopkins plays Roman emperor\n\nAnthony Hopkins dons a toga and crown of laurel for his latest series, \"Those Who are About to Die,\" which premieres all 10 episodes Friday via Peacock. Hopkins plays Emperor Vespasian, who is credited with bringing some harmony to Rome after the tumultuous reign of his predecessors. He's also famous for initiating several building projects, including the Colosseum.\n\nHopkins wears his own crown as one of the most respected actors in the field. But to him, it's just 9-to-5.\n\n\"To me acting's not like some guys who live, sleep and eat in the work they do. I don't. It's a job like anything else. I subscribe to the Robert Mitchum school of acting: show up, know your lines, make sure the checks on the way at the end. I know it sounds cynical and jaded, but it's not,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not a cure for cancer, not a cure for disease, not that important. What I do is entertainment. We have lots of awards for what we do which are way beyond. I've been asked, 'Isn't it boring, waiting around on set?' Well, that's what I get paid to do -- wait around and do a little bit of acting in between. It's easy, no big deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing",

That's where we come in. (Hint for cord-cutters: Peacock.)\n\nAnother valuable resource is USA TODAY's mega-guide to watching the Olympic Games. But here are six streamlined tips to help you figure out how you want to watch the Games.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nThe full might of NBCUniversal is behind broadcasting the 2024 Olympics. That includes its streaming service, Peacock. All 5,000 hours of Olympics coverage -- including every single one of the 329 medal events -- are available via Peacock. But the app's personalization preferences allow fans to create their ideal Olympic viewing format - with plenty of useful features. Examples of those features include:\n\nPeacock will the place to find alternative streaming options such as \"Gold Zone,\" \"Watch with Alex Cooper\" and \"Olympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson.\"\n\nThere will be hubs for every sport and updated medal standings, as well as a search feature and interactive schedule.\n\nFor those who appreciate their Olympics with a side of drama and storytelling, NBC's \"Primetime in Paris\" will be the preferred option. Olympic host Mike Tirico will welcome viewers with the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. Coverage will typically begin with a Team USA gold-medal performance and this is where Snoop Dogg will be making his appearances on behalf on NBC. Studio analysts can dive deeper into topics, while highlights from throughout the day will be shown. The primetime broadcast will begin at 8 p.m. ET nightly until the closing ceremony on Aug. 11.\n\nThat said, if you are a results-oriented consumer of sports, perhaps tuning into the live action is more suitable. Again, every event is available live at any given moment, and that includes potentially streaming exclusively on Peacock or NBCOlympics.com with cable verification. The higher-profile events will be held at night, typically, putting them roughly between 2-5 p.m. ET (although not a steadfast rule). Keep those hours clear.\n\nFor non-Peacock users, NBC has published its tentative TV listings. Keep that page handy, even if it's subject to change, to give you a general idea of what's happening when and where to find it.\n\nOnce the action in Paris begins, it never stops. As many as 40 events could be happening at the same time. NBC is trying to ride the wave of \"NFL RedZone\" and created \"Gold Zone\" for Paris, and the whip-around show will actually feature Scott Hanson. \"Gold Zone\" streams live on Peacock from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET from July 27-Aug. 10. Andrew Siciliano, Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbajabiamila will host in addition to Hanson.\n\nThis cannot be overstated. Everything you could watch on NBC or cable is available on Peacock on top of the exclusive programs and features within the app. Even for those who still have a cable bill, it may be the place to watch the Games.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news -- fast.

The action begins July 24 with coverage of soccer games on USA.\n\nThe additions are expected to add new reasons to tune into the primetime broadcasts, when NBC and Peacock have already shown the events live during the day.\n\nThe three-hour nightly \"curated presentation,\" as Executive Producer Molly Solomon calls it, will recap each day's top performances on NBC and include a host of extras.\n\n\"We're going to be blasting off with 'Gold Medals' at 7 p.m. and then we're going to infuse our storytelling with more behind-the-scenes access, more athlete-generated content and more onscreen technology that will help the viewer appreciate these magnificent athletes,\" Solomon says. \"You may know what happened but we're going to tell you why it happened and advance the story in primetime.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

A lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation but this is a chance for the world to be on one page. It's like a peace offering.\"\n\nBecause Snoop has a wide fan base (and a beat of his own), he plans to shake up something that's very traditional, \"bringing my flavor. We're just having fun.\"\n\nRowdy Gaines, an Olympic gold medal winner in swimming and longtime NBC commentator, says the Games are a way to give athletes who don't have a Super Bowl or World Series a bit of the spotlight. \"It's a four-year journey,\" he says. It represents \"the pinnacle of our success.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSnoop, he adds, may spend years producing a record \"and when you put a record together, you're all in.\"\n\nThe key, Snoop Dogg says, is to work hard. \"To be an Olympic athlete takes a lot. I look forward to being around them. I've been working out myself,\" he jokes, \"so in case they need a hand or a foot or an arm, I'm available.\"\n\nWhile professionals like Gaines will handle the calls (many of them at the venues, not at U.S. locations), the celebrities will get to share their reactions to the results.\n\nA group of social media influencers, Solomon says, will help tell the story in a different way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of different flavors of our social coverage. Each night, it'll be pushed to primetime.\"\n\nIf a story breaks during the Olympics, Solomon's team will be ready to react quickly. \"We have like 10 ENG crews just ready to respond to the next great story,\" she says. \"We're ready to pivot, but it all starts with a great plan.\"\n\nWhile live coverage is exciting, \"it don't matter where you're at,\" Snoop Dogg says.\n\n\"You got the spirit...you do what you do, from the living room, from the broadcast booth.\"\n\nBecause of the six-hour time difference between the United States and Paris, most events will occur during the afternoon here. From 1 to 4 p.m. central time, marquee events will take place. Then, in the evening, viewers who aren't home during the day will get the recaps.\n\n\"We're going to be at 243 live hours on NBC,\" Solomon says. \"That lets us make sure we're going to reach the broadest possible audience with this Olympics.\"\n\nThe three hours of \"turnaround time,\" she adds, will let producers talk to families, coaches and athletes to \"advance the stories. Imagine if Snoop was also at the venue. We can weave all that into the storytelling.\"\n\nComplete coverage of the Summer Olympics begins July 26 on NBC and Peacock.\n\nBruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Hundreds of events will take place over the course of a few weeks, many of them occurring simultaneously. It's a lot for any sports fan to keep up with. And this year, there are more places than ever to watch.\n\nIn the past, Olympics broadcasts have floundered when trying to satisfy audiences. NBC, the main broadcaster of the Olympics in the US, has gotten flak for its programming strategy during Games past by spreading the events out over too many TV channels and delaying some coverage until prime time instead of presenting the Games the way most people prefer to watch their sports: live. But this time, NBC and other broadcasters seem eager to make it much easier to find what you want to see, when you want to see it.\n\nOnline platforms are going for the gold this year as well. TikTok has an Olympics hub. In the weeks leading up tot the Games, the Instagram account @olympics has been posting training videos and action stills to its 8.2 million followers. NBC is partnering with creators across social media to cover events and to spin up content from Paris. Google will showcase live scores, medal ceremonies, and highlights within search results and inside the answers to queries handled by its Assistant. It's a full buffet.\n\n\"We are going through a period where one of the most interesting, but to some extent also problematic, elements is the extreme segmentation of the audience,\" says Yiannis Exarchos, the CEO of the Olympic Broadcasting Service, the organization that produces and manages media output for the Olympics. \"You have audiences all over the place, consuming content in different ways, and there are very few opportunities where you can really bring together large audiences.\"\n\nThe Olympics, he says, is one of those opportunities. The biggest change to Olympics coverage is that there is simply going to be much more of it. The total run time of the various competitions in the Olympic games will clock in at around 3,800 hours. The OBS plans to turn that into more than 11,000 hours of content -- a mixture of live coverage, behind-the-scenes features, narrated analysis, and highlights.\n\nAnyone tuning in will need a way to sift through it all. NBC wants to make that easier on its Peacock streaming platform and has debuted a bunch of new viewing options that will let users curate their own Olympics coverage, in addition streaming nearly every event live from the Olympics and the Paralympics. (The Paralympics, also taking place in Paris, start on August 28.)\n\nIn the Peacock Olympics hub, viewers can sort listings by sport, athlete, or country to find the events they want to watch and then add them to a watch list. This lets viewers create their own schedule to watch events live, as well as a place where they can come back to watch their chosen events later. Viewers can also watch up to four live events on the same screen using a new Multiview tool that makes it easy to flip between concurrent events.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Broadcasting_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Broadcasting Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/6696dc2b6a7bb10e67ef7e43/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/This-Year's-Olympics-Broadcast-Will-Have-Crazy-Tech,-More-Drones,-and-Gobs-of-AI-GettyImages-2160036174.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739975", "eventUri": "eng-9739975", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 189, "textEnd": 196}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 210, "textEnd": 219}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-28", "textStart": 2707, "textEnd": 2716}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

How revered is she? Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis provides the narration for the trailer.\n\nThe first two episodes of the series debuted Wednesday, while the third and fourth episodes are still being produced and will be released after the Games.\n\nShe's a true superstar and after everything she's been through (watch, you'll see; no spoiler alerts here), the 27-year-old's greatest accomplishment might one day be that she persevered and stayed strong even when she was criticized and almost counted out, when people thought she quit, on her team and on her country.\n\nBiles remained sound and knew her mind and body well. She never imagined the \"twisties,\" or what she endured previously. Everyone's life does take strange turns.\n\nBiles is an inspiration for all young girls, gymnasts or not, and a role model for mental health --how to deal with it as well as recovering from toxic situations.\n\nShe may well be, as Livvy Dunne predicts, on a revenge tour this summer in The City of Lights.\n\nWe shall find out soon, but the sparkling women's gymnastics team is going to be must-see TV.\n\nYes, NBC, I'll take a pittance for that plug -- and this, too.\n\nPer the official NBC Olympics site, here's everything you need to know about when you can watch Simone perform:\n\nWomen's gymnastics at the 2024 Paris Olympics will air on NBC, USA Network and E!, and stream on Peacock and NBC Olympics platforms starting on Sunday, July 28.\n\nDates: July 28 - August 5\n\nVenue: Bercy Arena\n\nTV channels: NBC, USA Network, E!\n\nStreaming: Peacock, NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, NBC app, NBC Olympics app\n\nVisit NBCOlympics.com/FAQ for more information on watching the Paris Olympics, including links to download the NBC, NBC Olympics and Peacock apps.\n\nVisit NBCOlympics.com/FAQ for more information on watching the Paris Olympics, including links to download the NBC, NBC Olympics and Peacock apps.\n\nWomen's gymnastics will start on Saturday, July 28 and conclude on Monday, August 5. Depending on which individual events Biles qualifies for, she is likely to compete on the following days:\n\nThe complete gymnastics schedule, including the apparatus feeds for each session and TV listings, is also available on the NBCOlympics.com schedule page.\n\nAll live streams are also available to watch on mobile, tablet and connected TV devices via the Peacock, NBC and NBC Olympics apps.\n\nIn closing, you would be wise to consult those sites, use those links, download those apps make a Games watching plan because, remember, Paris is six hours ahead of New York and nine ahead of

The Comcast streamer will carry every Olympic event, it will just cost you two extra dollars a month to watch them.\n\nWhile the price increase was announced at the start of May, most people had forgotten about it. Especially anyone who added the service to watch the Miami Dolphins-Kansas City Chiefs wild card game and forgot to cancel. Whatever the circumstances of your Peacock subscription, you were hit with an announcement that the price of the streaming brick was going up on Thursday morning, right around the time coverage of The Open began.\n\nAs of last week Peacock was still trying to lure former customers back to the site with the prices they were about to increase. This image is from an e-mail one customer received on July 13 that featured a countdown clock to the Olympics and promised access to \"TV Classics\" likeTwo and a Half Men. There was no mention of the impending price increase.\n\nWhen Peacock launched four years ago, it was $4.99 a month. Who knows what it will cost by the time the 2028 Olympic games roll around.

This event brought in a large audience and excitement, as it follows the same traditional rules as normal 5\u00d75 basketball but with slight modifications.\n\nFor starters, there will only be three players on the court each time rather than the original five, and the game will only be played on one side of the court as each team shares a single hoop. The match can end in two different ways: the first team to reach 21 points or whichever team is leading after ten minutes of game time. In traditional basketball, there is a three-point line, and that line will still remain here, but every shot made beyond the line will only represent two points. Every shot made inside the line closer to the basket will serve as one point.\n\nFor Team USA, the men's team is looking to improve its odds, as they didn't qualify for the event in 2020. The women's team took home the silver medal and has its hopes set on gold this time around.\n\nWhen it comes to constructing the roster, there are no NBA players on the men's side because the qualifying period took place during the NBA playoffs. This means the players on the squad are committed to playing solely 3\u00d73 in order to qualify. Key players on the men's side include Jimmer Ferdette and Canyon Barry.\n\nThe women's side can recruit WNBA players because it doesn't interfere with the WNBA season. The USA women's squad won the 2023 FIBA World Cup and is expected to repeat success in the Olympics this year. Hailey Van Lith will be the first American who is still in college to play in the Olympic games since 1988. She shot lights out in the 2023 FIBA World Cup, leading all USA scorers with 44 points.\n\nNBC, CNBC, USA, and E! will be the main channels broadcasting Olympic 3\u00d73 basketball in Paris this year. Peacock will be the mainstream broadcast, providing the most content available, including every single men's and women's 3\u00d73 basketball game. Below are the major streaming services that will have Olympic coverage this summer.\n\nFor the first time ever, Peacock will stream every sport and event during the Olympic Summer Games. This includes every medal game, along with 24/7 media coverage and analysts tracking the progress of all the countries competing.\n\nThe men's and women's 3\u00d73 basketball events will take place between July 30 and August 5. With the Premium Plan, you can watch every single game through Peacock. For subscribers who want to watch totally interrupted, Peacock offers an ad-free plan if you upgrade to Premium Plus.\n\nDIRECTV STREAM is a live TV streaming service for watching all sports, including the 2024 Summer Olympics. Its Entertainment plan has all the basics you'll need to watch Olympic 3\u00d73 basketball matchups this year. When you subscribe, you'll get access to channels that air everything from pool play to final medal rounds.\n\nIf you miss any match during this exciting new event, your DIRECTV STREAM plan will include unlimited cloud DVR storage, so you'll have plenty of room to record and watch later.\n\nFubo is another popular streaming service that appeals to fans of all sports. Fubo's Pro plan offering will include every channel you need to stay updated on Olympic 3\u00d73 basketball. Outside of the Olympics, Fubo strives to cater to all kinds of sports fans looking for a streaming service. Hang on to your subscription after the action this summer to watch other high-profile sporting events across professional soccer, golf, and baseball leagues.\n\nSimilar to most streaming services, unlimited cloud DVR storage is included with all of Fubo's plans. That way, you can record coverage and watch it back whenever is most convenient for you.\n\nHulu + Live TV will allow users to watch the Olympics smoothly. These channels will provide everything you need to watch Olympic 3\u00d73 basketball, from initial matchups to the final, during both the men's and women's coverage throughout the summer.\n\nIf life gets in the way and you miss an Olympic event you planned to watch, Hulu has your back. They offer unlimited cloud DVR storage in their plan, which is on par with most other major live TV streaming services available.\n\nSling TV does not offer CNBC within its Blue & Orange plan. However, you'll be able to watch plenty of Olympic 3\u00d73 basketball events with Sling as it does include NBC, USA, and E!. Also, it's important to keep in mind that some channel availability depends on your local area, like NBC, for example. That said, make sure to check your zip code to confirm that NBC is available in your area before confirming your subscription.\n\nWhen you consider perks outside of channel availability, Sling falls short among its competitors with DVR storage. Your plan will come with 50 hours of cloud DVR storage, and subscribers will have the option to add on more storage with an additional monthly fee. If DVR storage doesn't matter as much to you, Sling may be an affordable option if you're willing to miss coverage on a few core channels airing Olympic events.\n\nYouTube TV has been a main sponsor for the NBA Finals for the last few years and provides an ideal viewing experience for the men's and women's Olympic 3\u00d73 basketball coverage. Subscribers will get every channel they need to keep up with this particular event throughout the summer.\n\nYouTube TV matches most live TV streaming services as it will provide unlimited hours of cloud DVR storage. Outside of recording space, YouTube TV is a convenient option for subscribers who are NFL fans and want to opt into NFL Sunday Ticket for football season. Pre-season coverage gears up right after the Olympics, so you wouldn't have to cancel service or switch services.\n\nThe entire men's and women's 3\u00d73 basketball event schedule can be found on NBCOlympics.com.* Coverage will begin on July 30, so be sure to plan how you're going to stream matchups in advance.\n\n*All of the times are Eastern.\n\nYou can watch the Olympic basketball event in a variety of ways, but Peacock will be the home for all Olympic coverage this summer. Channels like NBC, CNBC, USA, and E! will all take part in hosting Olympic basketball broadcasts, and the majority of these channels are available on live TV streaming services live DIRECTV STREAM and Hulu + Live TV.\n\nNo, Cameron Brink will not play in the women's Olympic basketball 3\u00d73 event. She was chosen for the 3\u00d73 squad but is currently recovering from a torn ACL she sustained in her WNBA rookie season. Dearica Hamby will replace Cameron Brink in the 3\u00d73 event.\n\nAll of the 3\u00d73 basketball games will be played at the La Concorde 1 venue.\n\n\"We often receive complimentary products to review at Sportsnaut.

The action begins July 24 with coverage of soccer games on USA.\n\nThe additions are expected to add new reasons to tune into the primetime broadcasts, when NBC and Peacock have already shown the events live during the day.\n\nThe three-hour nightly \"curated presentation,\" as Executive Producer Molly Solomon calls it, will recap each day's top performances on NBC and include a host of extras.\n\n\"We're going to be blasting off with 'Gold Medals' at 7 p.m. and then we're going to infuse our storytelling with more behind-the-scenes access, more athlete-generated content and more onscreen technology that will help the viewer appreciate these magnificent athletes,\" Solomon says. \"You may know what happened but we're going to tell you why it happened and advance the story in primetime.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

A lot of times in the world, it's always division and separation but this is a chance for the world to be on one page. It's like a peace offering.\"\n\nBecause Snoop has a wide fan base (and a beat of his own), he plans to shake up something that's very traditional, \"bringing my flavor. We're just having fun.\"\n\nRowdy Gaines, an Olympic gold medal winner in swimming and longtime NBC commentator, says the Games are a way to give athletes who don't have a Super Bowl or World Series a bit of the spotlight. \"It's a four-year journey,\" he says. It represents \"the pinnacle of our success.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nSnoop, he adds, may spend years producing a record \"and when you put a record together, you're all in.\"\n\nThe key, Snoop Dogg says, is to work hard. \"To be an Olympic athlete takes a lot. I look forward to being around them. I've been working out myself,\" he jokes, \"so in case they need a hand or a foot or an arm, I'm available.\"\n\nWhile professionals like Gaines will handle the calls (many of them at the venues, not at U.S. locations), the celebrities will get to share their reactions to the results.\n\nA group of social media influencers, Solomon says, will help tell the story in a different way.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of different flavors of our social coverage. Each night, it'll be pushed to primetime.\"\n\nIf a story breaks during the Olympics, Solomon's team will be ready to react quickly. \"We have like 10 ENG crews just ready to respond to the next great story,\" she says. \"We're ready to pivot, but it all starts with a great plan.\"\n\nWhile live coverage is exciting, \"it don't matter where you're at,\" Snoop Dogg says.\n\n\"You got the spirit...you do what you do, from the living room, from the broadcast booth.\"\n\nBecause of the six-hour time difference between the United States and Paris, most events will occur during the afternoon here. From 1 to 4 p.m. central time, marquee events will take place. Then, in the evening, viewers who aren't home during the day will get the recaps.\n\n\"We're going to be at 243 live hours on NBC,\" Solomon says. \"That lets us make sure we're going to reach the broadest possible audience with this Olympics.\"\n\nThe three hours of \"turnaround time,\" she adds, will let producers talk to families, coaches and athletes to \"advance the stories. Imagine if Snoop was also at the venue. We can weave all that into the storytelling.\"\n\nComplete coverage of the Summer Olympics begins July 26 on NBC and Peacock.\n\nBruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow

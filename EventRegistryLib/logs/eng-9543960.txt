Ingram, who has ADHD, kept things under control for a number of years, she says, by developing a cleaning schedule and finding methods to overcome her struggles with procrastination and motivation. (John Morris/For The Washington Post)\n\nBrogan Ingram isn't a cleaner by trade. But never mind that. Her cleaning videos have landed her 7 million social media followers and lucrative partnerships with major companies such as Scrub Daddy. The 31-year-old from Halifax, Nova Scotia, cleans in extreme environments: bathrooms so dirty they've become unusable, insect-infested kitchens full of trash, bedrooms piled to the ceiling because of hoarding. And she does it all free.\n\nIngram's popularity on TikTok and Instagram, where she posts as @nottheworstcleaner, stems from her videos discussing the connection between mental health and housekeeping. Research has found that a messy environment can significantly impact our well-being, leaving us stressed out and overwhelmed. Ingram has dealt with this firsthand. She was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as a child, then studied psychology in college, she says, \"because I understood my brain wasn't the same as everybody else's, and I wanted to learn about it.\" She had also struggled to keep her own space tidy while working three jobs to put herself through school.\n\n\"My apartment looked like one of the houses that I clean in my videos,\" she says. \"I had neglected it so bad, and it was to the point where it was affecting me so greatly. If you don't keep things clean, it affects your mental health. But at the same time, if you're experiencing poor mental health, it's very hard to keep your environment clean.\n\n\"It's just a vicious, nonstop cycle,\" she adds. \"I needed to learn ways that I could change my relationship with cleaning, and I learned things that worked for me.\"\n\nIngram kept things under control for a number of years, she says, by developing a cleaning schedule and finding methods to overcome her struggles with procrastination and motivation.\n\nDuring the pandemic, though, when she was at home with her husband and three kids, tidying started to feel overwhelming again. This time, Ingram shared her struggles on social media.\n\n\"It blew up with the first video of me sharing my ADHD-friendly cleaning schedule,\" she says. \"It went viral overnight and never stopped after that.\"\n\nFollowers started to send requests for help cleaning their homes, and Ingram tried to connect them with professional cleaners. The first time, she says, it went \"swimmingly.\" She raised money from followers and paid a crew to clean the home of a single mom of five. But that success proved hard to repeat. When the pros quoted prices in the tens of thousands, or told her they couldn't help because the homes were too hazardous, she took matters into her own hands.\n\nNow, she spends her weekends and a few evenings a week doing free cleanings. Most of the time she cleans within driving distance of her home in Halifax, but she travels for cleanings, too, often with Scrub Daddy footing the bill for flights and accommodations. Her husband's flexible job and an \"awesome best friend who watches my kids all the time\" both allow Ingram to keep taking on free cleanings. Though the messes are sometimes a bit intense and require her to have \"an iron stomach,\" Ingram says the work is rewarding and impactful.\n\n\"A few days of my time changes the entire course of their life,\" she says. \"They go from having no hope at all, and living like that for years, to a clean slate without that constant stress and overwhelm.\"\n\nBut it's not just hoarders she's out to help. Wherever you are in your relationship to cleaning, Ingram has tips to get your home -- and your mental health -- in better shape:\n\nStart small\n\nCleaning is not something you can do in one quick session, according to Ingram.\n\n\"Don't try to clean the whole house at once,\" she says. \"Don't even try to clean a whole room at once.\" Instead, she recommends choosing one corner or surface in the room.\n\n\"It sounds silly, but I say just pick one, like, two- to three-square-foot space and just clean that,\" Ingram adds. Habit formation starts small, and once you can keep a tiny space clean, it will become easier to keep larger areas in the house tidy.\n\n\"It's about not having insurmountable, unrealistic expectations about getting the whole house clean,\" she says. \"People get stuck because they see a huge task they don't want to do or don't feel like they can complete, so they just don't.\"\n\nStick to a schedule\n\nHaving a schedule for cleaning can help reduce the overwhelmed feelings. If you're just starting out, set a timer for just a few minutes a day.\n\n\"You do your five minutes, and all of a sudden you have motivation,\" Ingram says. \"It's crazy how it happens. You get a little shot of, 'Okay, I completed something!' And you feel like, 'Well, maybe I can do something else.' It snowballs.\"\n\nSticking to your schedule also means only cleaning for a set amount of time each day and trying not to overdo it.\n\n\"If you're spending hours or a whole day doing something, chances are you're just adding to the negative relationship with cleaning and subconsciously making yourself dread doing it again,\" Ingram says.\n\nSchedules are a very personalized thing. Ingram cleans her home for 30 minutes each day, focusing on a different room. Then, for eight weeks twice a year, she adds a few more intense tasks to her daily schedule for each room -- things like scrubbing walls and baseboards or cleaning behind the refrigerator -- for a deeper cleaning.\n\n\"There's not one schedule that's going to be for everybody, because our houses are different, and our energy levels are different,\" she says. \"I always tell people to just think about your life, write down all the rooms in your home, and then just make little bullet points underneath each room of things that you could do in each one daily or weekly, not to deep clean it, but just keep it tidy.\"\n\nDon't go it alone\n\nIt's common to think about everyday clutter as a shameful thing, Ingram says. People get stressed about cleaning before company arrives and feel a need to apologize for even the most minor messes. None of that is helpful. Instead, Ingram says, people need to recognize that most everyone has some version of the same struggles, and teamwork can help.\n\n\"Body doubling\" is another common technique used by people with ADHD. Essentially, it means doing potentially frustrating tasks in the company of another person, whose presence can help reduce distraction and procrastination.\n\n\"Over the years, especially when I had small children, I had friends that came over and helped me clean, or they'd come over and sit on the couch for hours and talk to me while I did all of my laundry,\" Ingram says.\n\nUltimately, Ingram says, her best advice when it comes to cleaning is to let go of the idea of a perfect, spotless home. While it's easy to be fooled by things like social media, she says, very few people live that way.\n\n\"We've just become so accustomed to thinking everything has to be perfect and being ashamed and feeling judged if it's not,\" she says. \"It's just not realistic.

Ingram previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nEmmanuel Onasanya, 33, admitted driving to the scene, but said he had 'no idea' the shooter had a gun. He denied a single offence of manslaughter.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Savage' murdered friend in his own living room before trying to behead him in horror scenes\n\nFollowing a two-week trial at Minshull Street Crown Court, jurors found Mr Onasanya not guilty of the offence after just over an hour of deliberations.\n\nFollowing a previous trial in November last year, both Ingram and Mr Onasanya were cleared of murder. Ingram will be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter at a later date.\n\nJurors heard that the confrontation on the street followed a row over 'training shoes'. Prosecutor Gordon Cole KC said that Mr Onasanya had cleaned training shoes belonging to Mr Bobmanuel.\n\nHe was alleged to have 'enlisted the help of' Ingram for the confrontation, Mr Cole said.\n\nThe jurors were told that Ingram brought the weapon before firing it into the floor. It then 'splintered' before it hit and killed Mr Bobmanuel, the court heard.\n\nIt was said that Mr Onasanya 'accepts' he had driven to the scene with Ingram although he says he had 'no idea there was going to be violence'.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Mr Onasanya 'must have known and did know' that a gun would be brought to the scene and that he had the 'requisite intention for him to be guilty of manslaughter'.\n\nA few minutes after the shooting, Mr Onasanya was said to have returned to the scene and took photos of Mr Bobmanuel on the floor at a time when he was already dead or 'very close to it', said Mr Cole. The jurors were told about a series of Instagram messages between the defendant and Mr Bobmanuel. In one, the defendant is said to have told Mr Bobmanuel: \"If you are so rich, pay me my money.\"\n\nMr Bobmanuel is said to have replied 'or what?' before adding: \"Embarrassing. You ain't getting s**t. You joker.\"\n\nThe KC added that the prosecution's case was that there was 'an anticipation of trouble and an anticipation of violence... by dint of the messages'.\n\nMr Onasanya handed himself in to police later that afternoon on March 25. He told officers about what had happened, and when he was arrested on suspicion of murder, he said: \"So I'm under arrest? I'm a witness though. I've come to do the right thing.\"\n\nAt his previous trial, Onasanya maintained he had no idea that Ingram had a gun or that he knew a shooting was to take place. He said he was 'apprehensive' about going to the meeting.\n\nHe said he picked up Ingram, who was carrying a blue carrier bag, in his Ford Fusion car. Mr Onasanya denied he wanted any 'trouble', telling jurors it was 'the last thing I wanted'.\n\nHe told jurors there was no mention of a firearm or a shooting during the journey in the car. The jury heard that Mr Onasanya parked the car and about a minute after he got out, Ingram had fired the gun.\n\nMr Onasanya said he put his hands on his head and said 'oh no', while Ingram told him to 'get back in the car'. \"I was in disbelief, I just couldn't believe that had just happened,\" Mr Onasanya said.\n\nHe said he then got back into his car with Ingram. \"I was shaking, I was in total shock,\" Mr Onasanya said.\n\nOf Ingram, he said: \"He said a lot, but I wasn't really listening, because my head wasn't there. I was hysterical, I just kept saying 'what have you done, that's your brother'. Ingram admitted he was the shooter and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. But he denied murder and argued he did not intend to kill or seriously harm his half-brother.\n\nIngram, of Bucklow Avenue, Fallowfield, will be sentenced at a later date. Mr Onasanya, of John Beeley Avenue, Openshaw, was discharged from the dock.\n\nIn a tribute to Mr Bobmanuel issued after his death, his family said: \"Zikel was many things to many people, he was a good friend, a hard-working colleague, part of a large extended family, but ultimately, he was his mother's son, her pride and joy. He held the heart of his girlfriend in his hand and was a hands-on father to his beloved children, the youngest just 6 weeks old.\n\n\"Zikel was happy and fulfilled, he was working hard to provide for his family and was never more content than when he was spending time with them. It is difficult to comprehend that Zikel has died under such tragic circumstances and the shock is profound.\n\n\"We are devastated beyond belief and find it hard to comprehend life without him.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_walker@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Amy Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openshaw", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Openshaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Openshaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crown Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decapitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucklow_Rural_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bucklow Rural District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Beeley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Beeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fusion_(Americas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Fusion (Americas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallowfield", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallowfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fallowfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27858599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NWC_MEN_26563756.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543960", "eventUri": "eng-9543960", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 228, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Bryant Alumni-Athlete Award, named a Second-Team defensive back on Alabama's Team of the Century, and named to the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame after recording an interception and the a bowl record 80-yard punt return in the 1953 Orange Bowl.\n\nIngram was a Tuscaloosa native born and raised, attending Tuscaloosa High School where he was a standout football, baseball, and basketball player. Named an All-State halfback in his senior year before enrolling at Alabama in 1951 where he'd continue his football and baseball careers.\n\nIngram won three letters each in football and baseball with the Crimson Tide, but his exploits on the football field outweighed his accomplishments on the baseball diamond. Nicknamed the honorable thief in his sophomore season after intercepting 11 passes and returning two for touchdowns to earn a First-Team All-SEC selection. Going on to also play quarterback and halfback for the Crimson Tide in his career alongside Bart Starr.\n\nIn 1955 Ingram signed to play football professionally for the Philadelphia Eagles but quickly transitioned into coaching after not playing in any regular season games for Philadelphia. Making three separate stops as a high school coach (including at his alma mater) before breaking through to the college level in 1960. Joining the Wake Forest coaching staff as a defensive backs coach for the Demon Deacons.\n\nAfter making assistant coaching stops at Virginia Tech, Georgia, and Arkansas Ingram would earn the first head coach job of his college coaching career. Named the head football coach at Clemson where he'd spend three seasons with a 12-21 overall record and introduce the trademark \"tiger paw\" logo. Resigning as head coach in 1972 ahead of his administration career.\n\nFor eight years Ingram worked for the SEC as the assistant commissioner of administration and the associate commissioner to H. Boyd McWhorter before becoming the athletic director at Florida State in January of 1981. Spending eight years with the Seminoles before serving in the same role for his alma mater Alabama. Hiring Gene Stallings as the head football coach would lead the Crimson Tide to a 1992 national championship win.

He was 90.\n\nIngram's death was confirmed to AL.com by Tommy Ford, a longtime Alabama athletics department staffer and close friend of the Ingram family. Funeral services are set for Saturday at Calvary Baptist Church in Tuscaloosa, with visitation from 10 a.m.-11:30 a.m.\n\nBorn Sept. 2, 1933, in Tuscaloosa, Ingram signed with Alabama in 1951 after a multi-sport career at Tuscaloosa High School. He was an All-SEC defensive back as a sophomore in 1952, when he set an SEC record with 10 interceptions.\n\nIngram added an interception and an 80-yard punt return in the Crimson Tide's season-ending 61-6 victory over Syracuse in the Orange Bowl, the most most lop-sided postseason win in program history. He also played baseball during his Alabama career, which began without much hesitation after being offered a scholarship by longtime assistant coach Hank Crisp.\n\n\"Alabama didn't have to recruit me,\" Ingram told author Kirk McNair for the 2005 book What It Means to Be Crimson Tide. \"I had been practicing to be an Alabama player since I was in about the fourth grade. And I spent a lot of time on the Alabama practice fields watching as a kid. I got letters from other schools, but I was never going anywhere else.\n\n\"One day during basketball season, coach Crisp asked me when I was going to sign. I told him I didn't know I had an offer. He told me to come by his office the next day, which I did. He then sent me to coach Lew Bostick's office to sign the scholarship. Coach Bostick told me it was out on the table, to fill it out and sign it. And I did. Years later when I was working for the Southeastern Conference, I went back in the files and found my scholarship papers that I had filled out myself.\"\n\nIngram played one season (1955) as a defensive back with the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles before going into coaching. He coached on the high school level at Brookwood and Tuscaloosa County before joining the college ranks as an assistant at Wake Forest in 1960.\n\nIngram also coached at Virginia Tech (then VPI), Georgia and Arkansas before becoming head coach at Clemson in 1970. His Tigers went just 12-21 in three seasons before he left to join the Southeastern Conference office as associate commissioner.\n\nIngram stayed with the SEC until 1981, when he became athletics director at Florida State. He remained with the Seminoles until 1989, when he returned to his alma mater to replace Steve Sloan, who died just last month at age 79.\n\nDuring his AD tenure at Alabama, Ingram was most famous for hiring Gene Stallings as head football coach prior to the 1990 season. An unpopular hire at the time due to Stallings' poor record at Texas A&M and with the NFL's Phoenix Cardinals, the former Alabama assistant under Paul \"Bear\" Bryant and Dallas Cowboys assistant under Tom Landry went on to win 70 games in seven seasons, including the 1992 national championship.\n\n\"I had known Gene Stallings when he was an assistant at Alabama and when he was at Texas A&M, and I knew he had done a great job for coach Bryant and coach Landry,\" Ingram told McNair. \"I knew he could take the heat and do the job, and that's why I chose him. I think (school president Roger) Sayers may have been skeptical, but he wasn't after he met Gene. And I don't think we could have gotten anyone who could have done a better job. And we got along great, maybe because we were both pretty ornery, two hard-headed people working together.\"\n\nIngram remained Alabama's AD until 1995, when he resigned after the school was placed on NCAA probation for the first time. Former Crimson Tide defensive back Antonio Langham had illegally received $400 from an agent after the 1992 season, but Stallings (with Ingram's authorization) improperly allowed him to keep playing while the school investigated.\n\nAlabama football was hit with major scholarship reductions after the NCAA case involving Langham (which also included an impermissible loan given to former Crimson Tide running back Gene Jelks in the late 1980s), banned from postseason play in 1995 and forced to forfeit eight victories in which Langham had played in 1993. Years later, Ingram told AL.com he believed his department had handled the Langham case properly at the time.\n\n\"Well it was just a situation where it somebody's word against somebody else's word,\" Ingram said. \"The wrong people won. The information that we had, the signed statements we had from people, it was ruled in another way. That was water under the dam. I never look back on anything like that. You have something like that happen, you've just got to close ranks and move on.\"\n\nIngram remained in the Alabama athletic department for a time after stepping down as AD, overseeing the expansion of Bryant-Denny Stadium that was completed in 1998. He continued to live in the Tuscaloosa area until his death.\n\nIngram is the third prominent former Alabama player to die in recent weeks, along with Sloan and Clell Hobson Sr., a Crimson Tide teammate of Ingram's in the early 1950s. Clell Hobson died March 14 at age 93.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The controversial quota system provided for 30 per cent reservations in civil services jobs for the families of veterans who fought the 1971 liberation war.\n\nHasina, 76, who ruled the South Asian country for 15 years, resigned as the prime minister on Monday and fled the country. After leaving Dhaka, she arrived at Hindon airbase in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, aboard a C-130 transport aircraft.

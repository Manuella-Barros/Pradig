Consistent,\" Acyn wrote on X.\"And again you can either nominate us or put us in the position or give us your vote. I would say nominate or give us your vote, but we want Libertarian votes because you stand for what we stand for and don't waste a vote. And don't allow the worst president in the history of our country to come back and do the final destruction of America,\" Trump said while being booed.Trump was not the only one to be met with boos from the crowd as Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee was also booed when he spoke out in support of Trump.Ron Filipkowski, editor-in chief of MeidasTouch, shared a video, which has over 700,000 views as of Sunday morning of Lee being booed as he encouraged the crowd to vote for Trump.\"I encourage you, take a listen to Donald Trump, support Donald Trump, restore the Constitution,\" the senator said.Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.However, some people showed their support for the Republican and chanted \"We want Trump\" during his speech, but was soon drowned out by the crowd's loud boos.In another X post, Acyn shared a video, which garnered over 700,000 views as of Sunday morning, of the moment Trump supporters attempted to drum up support.\"Trump supporters attempt to chant Trump and are quickly drowned out by boos,\" Acyn wrote.The crowd at the Libertarian convention did cheer when Trump promised to commute the sentence of deep web market mastermind, Ross Ulbricht, who is currently serving a life sentence for the now-defunct illegal online marketplace, \"Silk Road.\"In an emailed statement to Newsweek on Saturday night, Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said they \"absolutely\" knew \"that it's not exactly home base\" for the Republican frontrunner.\"There will be people who want him to be there, and people who don't want him to be there, but we're on offense and competing for nontraditional votes in order to unite the country,\" Miller said. \"President Trump is going to get credit for showing up and making clear he wants to earn votes from members of the Libertarian Party and people who view themselves as being more libertarian minded.\"", "summary": "Videos on social media show the former president being met with boos at several points as he spoke to the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/videos-donald-trump-booed-during-speech-viral-1904824", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2399253/donald-trump.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:00:29", "author": "Natalie Venegas", "authors": ["Natalie Venegas"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.087}

As terrorists smashed through a kitchen window to the Ben-Zvi family\u2019s home in Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, in southern Israel, 11-year-old Petel, a Labrador-mix, began madly barking from the safe room. \u201cShe\u2019s jumping on the door, barking like crazy,\u201d Ela Ben-Zvi, 38, recalled. The dog\u2019s bellowing, she added, was picked up by a baby monitor in the safe room linked to house\u2019s stereo, which began blasting out the dog\u2019s snarls \u2014 sending the terrorists running. \u201cThe same group of terrorists went inside two of our neighbors\u2019 houses and killed them,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume her presence . . . saved our lives.\u201d When Israeli troops reached the Ben-Zvi\u2019s home later in the day to rescue the couple and their children, the dog refused to leave the house. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t carry her because I had one kid on my back and was dragging another, my husband was holding the youngest and the backpack with one set of clothes each,\u201d she said, adding the soldiers\u2019 couldn\u2019t carry the pooch and protect the family at the same. Before fleeing on foot under a volley of bullets, the couple locked Petel in their room with food and water, with plans to return in a couple of days. The following Tuesday, however, the Ben-Zvis learned that Petel was found wounded at the kibbutz\u2019s front gate. Soldiers bandaged the dog and brought her to a veterinarian clinic in Rehovot, where she underwent surgeries to fix a broken leg and remove shrapnel lodged in her body. The Ben-Zvis initially evacuated to a hotel near Dead Sea, in northern Israel. In March, they moved to a home with a yard, where they reunited with their furry champion, keeping her by their side until her sudden but peaceful death last week. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Oct. 7, Petel would still be with us,\u201d Ben-Zvi said.", "summary": "Petel, whose ferocious barking scared Hamas terrorists who attempted to raid her family's home during the Oct. 7 attack, has died.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/world-news/heroic-dog-who-saved-family-from-oct-7-hamas-attack-dies/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/sunday-news-petel-hero-dog-83359391.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:34:56", "author": "Matthew Sedacca", "authors": ["Matthew Sedacca"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.473}

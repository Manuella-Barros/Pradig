The city of Durham has agreed to pay Howard a settlement of $7.75 million, marking the end of a long and arduous journey for the man falsely accused of a double murder.\n\nHoward's attorney, Bradley Bannon, emphasized that the settlement is a moment for reflecting on the flaws in the justice system. Howard was wrongfully convicted in 1995 for the 1991 deaths of Doris Washington and her 13-year-old daughter, Nishonda. He was accused of strangling them and setting their apartment on fire, resulting in an 80-year prison sentence.\n\nIn 2016, Howard's convictions were vacated after DNA evidence, which wasn't tested until 2010, implicated two other men.

The Innocence Project played a crucial role in introducing new DNA evidence that led to the reversal of his conviction. In April 2021, Howard received a pardon of innocence from Gov. Roy Cooper, and a federal jury awarded him a $6 million settlement in December of the same year. However, the city of Durham initially refused to pay the judgment.\n\nYears later, in May, Howard's attorney confirmed that the city had agreed to a $7.75 million settlement, bringing some closure to Howard's ordeal.

Following Howard's release, Durham District Attorney Roger Echols decided not to retry the case. Additionally, the city of Durham settled a $350,000 lawsuit with former Durham Police Detective Darrell Dowdy, who was found liable in Howard's wrongful conviction.\n\nDespite these settlements, the city denies any admission of wrongdoing or liability, stating that the payments were made to avoid the hassle and cost of a retrial.

He's Finally Getting His Restitution", "body": "After spending nearly 24 years in prison for a wrongful conviction, a Black North Carolina man is finally receiving justice. The city of Durham has agreed to pay Darryl Anthony Howard a settlement of $7.75 million, according to several news sources.\n\nThat marks the end of a long and arduous journey for the man who was falsely accused of a double murder.\n\nHoward's attorney, Bradley Bannon, stated that the settlement is not a cause for celebration but rather a day of reflection on how easy it is for the system to get it wrong and how hard it is to make it right, according to the News & Observer newspaper.\n\nIn 1995, Howard was wrongfully convicted on two counts of second-degree murder for the 1991 deaths of Doris Washington and her 13-year-old daughter, Nishonda. He was accused of strangling Washington and her daughter and setting their apartment on fire four years prior and was later sentenced to 80 years in prison -- two consecutive 40-year terms for the two murders and one 40-year term for arson, as reported by ABC 11.\n\nHowever, in 2016, the convictions were vacated after DNA evidence, some of which wasn't tested until 2010, implicated two other men. Following this revelation, Durham County prosecutors dismissed the charges against Howard. DNA evidence pointed to sexual assault against both the mother and daughter before they were set on fire. They were found in their Few Gardens apartment. However, no DNA evidence linked Howard to the crime scene or as the rapist.\n\nThere was an eyewitness who testified against Howard during the case, but his accounts were scrutinized for being vague or contradictory. In fact, the witness reportedly recanted his story to police over time.\n\nA judge first vacated Howard's conviction in 2014, releasing him on bond then, but the state pushed back with an appeal. The Innocence Project represented Howard and introduced new DNA evidence that led to a reversal of his conviction.\n\nDespite being granted a pardon of innocence by Gov. Roy Cooper in April 2021 and a federal jury awarding Howard a $6 million settlement in December of the same year, the city of Durham refused to pay. The city council announced in April 2022 that it was refusing to pay the judgment because the council reasoned the jury found that the Durham detective found liable in Howard's wrongful conviction had acted \"in bad faith\" during the investigation of the murders.\n\nDurham City Attorney Kimberly Rehberg said then that the jury made \"a bad faith finding\" about former Durham Police Detective Darrell Dowdy.\n\n\"The city generally proceeds under the presumption that however conduct may have been portrayed in a complaint, the employee was engaged in the good faith execution of their duties on behalf of the city and was, thus, entitled to a defense,\" she continued.\n\nAfter the city's decision was announced, Dowdy's attorney slammed the council's refusal to pay the award, pointing out that the city had paid more than $4 million to defend Dowdy in court, all while in possession of the same set of facts the jury heard. The decision left the former police captain personally liable for the $6 million award.\n\n\"The city has known all along what Captain Dowdy did and decided to defend him on that basis,\" attorney Patricia Shields told the News & Observer.\n\nYears later, in May, Howard's attorney, Bradley Bannon, confirmed that Howard had settled with the city. The city of Durham agreed to pay Howard $7.75 million, a decision that finally brought some closure to Howard's ordeal.\n\nReflecting on his time in prison, Howard told WRAL News, \"I fought every day for the 24 years I was in jail, trying to prove my innocence.\" He added, \"I missed my mom. My son died when I was in prison. I missed my family. I missed living, you know - living a free life.\"\n\nHoward's story is a poignant reminder of the emotional toll of wrongful convictions. \"It's hard to explain,\" he said. \"It's hard to put into words. I'm frustrated, angry, all of these emotions. If you didn't do nothing wrong, you shouldn't be imprisoned.\"\n\nHoward's trial was overseen by a prosecutor who was later disbarred for misconduct in a separate case. Following Howard's release, Durham District Attorney Roger Echols decided not to retry the case, ABC 11 reported.\n\nAlso, the city of Durham settled a $350,000 lawsuit with Dowdy, who sued the city after it failed to indemnify him following the outcome of Howard's lawsuit.

(WSBT) -- South Bend Cubs infielder Ed Howard is quietly putting together a terrific season.\n\nSince May 24th, Howard is batting .410 - better than any other player in the Midwest League.\n\nHoward has suffered more than his share of setbacks since being drafted in the first round by the Cubs in 2020.\n\n\"To get back on my feet, and get back to where I'm at, I'm blessed, and I feel great,\" said Howard.\n\nMay 10, 2022, Ed Howard's season was over.\n\nHe's got a real road ahead of him, and you feel for him.\n\nA debilitating hip injury extended his absence halfway through the next season. And the 22-year-old is finally back into form.\n\n\"Taking what the game gives me. I feel like that's a big thing I've had to learn over the years. And you know, each day is different, you go out there, find your swing, find your adjustments, and go compete,\" said Howard.\n\nAfter hitting only .161 to start the season, Howard's feet are back underneath him. Since May 24th, Howard's hitting over .390 and his on-base plus slugging percentage is near 1.000, contributing like the first-round draft pick the Cubs brought him in to be.\n\n\"It's been a big stepping stone for him, to play the first full half healthy, and his body feels good. He's moving around out there well, at short and second, and then translating into the offensive side, too. He's putting together really good at-bats, finding ways to get hits, drive runs in,\" said Nick Lovullo, Cubs Manager.\n\nAs the second half of the season approaches Friday, Howard's renewed outlook and in-game performance will aid a Cubs push to the postseason.\n\n\"I believe in baseball that's everything. And as a team, we talk about that all the time in the clubhouse. It's all about confidence, and I feel like as we continue to win and keep playing well, confident and continue to grow, and that matters so much to this game,\" said Howard.", "source": {"uri": "wsbt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSBT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bennett_wise@wsbt.com", "name": "Bennett Wise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bend_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Bend Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwest_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwest League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bend,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wsbt.com/resources/media/895e9341-79e5-473a-8c97-664535683203-large16x9_EdHoward_frame_1253.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669457", "eventUri": "eng-9669457", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 117, "textEnd": 125, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 419, "textEnd": 425}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

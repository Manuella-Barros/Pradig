University of Calgary researchers have now used a century\u2019s worth of entries from the hut\u2019s log to illuminate how climate change is erasing historic climbs, making others more dangerous and altering the face of Canadian mountaineering. \u201cThere were absolutely comments about how climate change has impacted the Canadian Rockies and many hut visitors expressed sadness and concern over it,\u201d wrote Kate Hanly, a geography doctoral candidate and co-author of a paper drawing on those logs published in the journal Climatic Change. \u201cClimate change is contributing to changes in mountaineering conditions in the Canadian Rockies,\u201d she says in an email. Mountain guides agree. \u201cClassic routes have changed,\u201d says Paul Vidalin, president of the Association of Canadian Mountain Guides with 25 years of guiding experience. \u201cIn places the ice is gone and there\u2019s nothing but rotten rock left. What used to be nice mellow glacier (ski) runs are now really crevassed.\u201d James Gudjonson, a vice-president of the Alpine Club of Canada, has been guiding climbers and skiers for 30 years. \u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know a lot (of routes) have gone away or are slowly going away and they\u2019re not coming back.\u201d Hanly\u2019s paper combines 6,283 trip reports left by alpinists in the Abbot Pass hut log with those in a modern climbers database. It covers from 1923 to 2024. Early entries describe reliable ramps of firm snow en route to renowned peaks such as Mount Lefroy and Mount Victoria. But by 2017, all Lefroy climbers reported exposed ice and half faced bare, unstable rock. Five per cent of climbers on Victoria reported bare rock in the \u201950s, while more than half did between 2013 and 2022. That rock means more than just wobbly footing. As ice that holds it in place melts, it falls. On one route to Abbot \u2014 used since early in the last century \u2014 there were no reports of dangerous rockfall for the first 50 years of the hut\u2019s log. In the last decade, three-quarters of climbing parties mentioned it. The findings were similar for another route to the hut. \u201cThe typical right side was a war zone of rockfall with many near misses,\u201d said a 2009 entry. The threats aren\u2019t limited to Abbot Pass, says Christoph Dietzfelbinger, who has guided since the \u201980s in British Columbia\u2019s Coast Range. \u201cOn Mount Edziza, the access to the summit ridge used to be a simple snow slope,\u201d he says in an email. \u201cNow it is a 30- to 70-metre-high slope of black water ice that requires full alpine ice gear.\u201d In the Bugaboos range south of Golden, B.C., a popular col in what may be Canada\u2019s most famous climbing area is becoming increasingly inaccessible as it loses snow. \u201cI think it will eventually become a place where you just don\u2019t go,\u201d says Gudjonson. \u201cIt was the access point for dozens of routes.\u201d Other hazards are also increasing. Lower snowpacks and increased melting changes the shape and angle of glaciers, making them more prone to avalanches. Snow bridges allowing alpinists to safely cross crevasses are weakened. Gudjonson has seen that effect on the Wapta Icefield, a popular high-altitude glacier ski touring destination between Banff and Jasper, Alta. \u201cYou just don\u2019t have that snow because there\u2019s so much rain and warm temperatures,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting that good bridging. \u201cIt\u2019s OK in the summer \u2014 you can see the ice. But the real issue is the thinner snowpack in the winter.\u201d As well, areas that usually see deep, stable snowpacks now experience big dumps followed by long droughts, sometimes punctuated by rain or thaw. That creates snow layers and makes avalanche assessment even harder. \u201cIt\u2019s more erratic, more extreme,\u201d says Vidalin. \u201cThere seems to be more problem layers (in the snow), more variability, more complexity.\u201d Climate change is reducing some hazards. For example, Hanly says the thinner snowpack has shrunk cornices that used to hang over Victoria\u2019s southeast ridge, making travel faster and easier. New routes may open up as guides adapt. \u201cThe only constant in guiding is change,\u201d Hanly writes in the email. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are at risk of losing the culture of mountaineering in this country (at least right now) but I am pretty sure it will continue to evolve.\u201d There are economic consequences, Hanly adds. \u201cThe warm and dry weather in January reduced ice climbing opportunities so significantly that some guides didn\u2019t have any work. In the Canadian Rockies and especially the Bow Valley, where so much guiding occurs, climate change could have a significant impact on the industry with potentially cascading effects on the tourism and hospitality industry.\u201d Gudjonson points to the industry that\u2019s grown up around backcountry skiing and mountaineering. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the commercial operators?\u201d he asks. But that\u2019s not his main concern. The 2018 closure of the Abbot Pass hut haunts climbers and hikers, he says. \u201cWe have 100 years of history and something that\u2019s woven into the culture of the mountain community. You lose those historical places forever.\u201d Guides talk about it all the time, says Dietzfelbinger. \u201cThere is something best called ecological grief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA landscape that has been dear to me and that has nurtured many experiences is irrevocably changed.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 2, 2024.

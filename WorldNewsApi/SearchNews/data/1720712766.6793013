She was a tough kid and played soccer really hard,\u201d he told Fox News Digital in an interview published Sunday. He recalled Lucy\u2019s penchant for affection, referring to her as the \u201cmain cuddler\u201d in the family of six. \u201cI just remember her coming up with her bedhead [hair] and just wanting to sit with you for a long time. Not restless, just wants to lie with you and snuggle up,\u201d the grieving dad told the outlet. The tragedy happened June 1, the last day of an otherwise picturesque lakeside family vacation in Limerick, Maine. A badminton racquet splintered as little Lucy played with her three siblings in the front yard of the family\u2019s rental cottage, and a metal piece of it pierced the little girl\u2019s skull. Emergency responders rushed her to a local hospital, which then airlifted the still-breathing but unresponsive child to Maine Medical Center in Portland, according to Maine State Police. She was taken directly into the operating room, where surgeons removed part of her skull to relieve pressure, when Lucy flatlined on the table. Although doctors were successful in reviving the child, she had lost all brain function and the full ability to breathe on her own. Lucy succumbed to her injuries around 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day longer than she was expected to survive. Upon returning home from the life-changing trip, Jesse remembered looking at photos of Lucy with his wife Bethany and their other daughter. \u201cMy wife just made the comment that her beauty is haunting. Some of those pictures are just, she\u2019s just so gorgeous, and her personality is so incredible,\u201d he said. He described the family vacation up until the accident \u2014 which happened on the first week of his sabbatical \u2014 as \u201cthe best week of her life.\u201d Photos of the vacation Jesse shared on his blog show the bright smiles of Lucy and her siblings as the family climbed trees, hiked in the woods and enjoyed a nap on a lakeside hammock. \u201cWe did so many fun things,\u201d he recalled.", "summary": "\"I just remember her coming up with her bedhead [hair] and just wanting to sit with you for a long time.

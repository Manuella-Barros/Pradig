The Grammy-winning singer, 31, was just announced as a celebrity ambassador for MAC Cosmetics. To kick off her partnership, Petras stars in the latest campaign for the brand\u2019s iconic Viva Glam lipstick. Petras and pop star Danna Paola, who\u2019s also been named a celebrity ambassador, are joining the brand at an extra-special time. This year, MAC Cosmetics is celebrating both its 40th year in the beauty biz, as well as the 30th anniversary of the creation of Viva Glam, the lipstick known the world over for its lasting impact both in and outside the beauty industry. In 1994, Viva Glam launched with a vibrant blue lipstick and a clear mission: to give every penny from sales of the product to the MAC Aids Fund, which supports organizations helping underserved individuals living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. K.D. Lang became the face of the lipstick\u2019s second iteration and the collaboration cemented the brand\u2019s relationship with the biggest change-makers in entertainment. Since then, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Dita Von Teese, Fergie and Sia have all lent their faces and voices to Viva Glam campaigns. Now, it\u2019s Petras\u2019 turn, and as a genuine MAC Cosmetics fan, it\u2019s an opportunity she\u2019s more than ready for. \u201cIt took me one second to say yes to a Viva Glam campaign. It was just something that was very present when I was learning about gay culture,\u201d Petras tells PEOPLE exclusively of this \u201cprincess moment.\u201d Makeup has always been \u201cspecial\u201d to Petras. The transgender artist shares that she started wearing makeup at 12 after she\u2019d begun her hormone therapy journey. \u201cIt was just mascara and a little brow gel, but I remember that being so amazing because before that I needed to go to school in boys' clothes and have my hair back,\u201d she shares, adding, \u201cIt felt very freeing and I can't describe that feeling and how much that meant to me.\u201d Petras says one of her first memories of MAC Cosmetics is seeing one of its iconic black eyeshadow pots on her mother\u2019s vanity. \u201cI used to steal this black [shade] with a little bit of shimmer that she used to do her eyeliner with [because] I was always really fascinated by that.\u201d The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now At 7, she had a curiosity for makeup, but lacking skills, Petras \u201cjust looked like a raccoon,\u201d she remembers. In school, she recalls not really being \"the popular kid.\u201d As a result, Petras would spend most days sitting by herself, listening to music and spritzing MAC Cosmetics\u2019 Fix Plus Makeup Setting Spray on her face. \u201cMe and my few gay friends at school would always have it in our bags and spray it on each other all the time. I remember the smell and the fab time that we had,\u201d says Petras. These days, \u201cMAC's kind of like a lucky charm,\u201d she says. \u201cI was wearing Ruby Woo at the Grammys when I won.\u201d Petras says Viva Glam\u2019s goals align with her own. \u201cA lot of my career and my life is very based on I wish we could just treat everybody the same. Not on gender, not on where they're from, not on how much money they have, not on how they look,\u201d Petras shares \u201cMAC agrees. And Viva Glam, which has raised over half a billion dollars, stands for equality: sexual equality, gender equality, racial equality and environmental equality,\u201d she says. The brand\u2019s focus on trans youth especially, is \u201cvery close\u201d to her heart. \u201cThere's kids who are being kicked out of their homes, who are homeless from a young age for being themselves. There's access to treatment laws being passed in the world right now that target transgender children and kids and that really sucks to see and it's such a wild time that I really think it's really important to me to be able to help and give back in this way \u2014 and what a fab way it is,\u201d she says. Viva Glam has the power to make people feel beautiful on the outside and inside, Petras says. \u201cTo buy a lipstick, and then to feel good about it too is such a special thing. When I was young, Viva Glam educated me about a lot of HIV issues. I was seeing the campaign and then looking into them raising money for HIV. It's cool to to look back and be like, \u2018This product has really helped a lot of people.\u2019\" For the 30th anniversary campaign, MAC Cosmetics is asking the world to put your money where your mouth is by purchasing one of four MACximal Silky Matte Viva Glam Lipsticks ($25 each). While Viva Empowered, Viva Heart and Viva Planet are past Viva Glam shades that boast the brand\u2019s new formula, Viva Equality is entirely new. Petras wears Viva Heart, a blue-red hue, during the interview. \u201cIt's a really beautiful '90s muted red.

Viva Equality, a deep neutral hue, \u201cwould probably look amazing on everyone,\u201d Petras says. Meanwhile, she describes Viva Planet, a beige-mauve shade, as \u201ca more casual nude, for me.\u201d Petras feels best in her skin when she\u2019s out in nature with her dogs. \u201cWhen I kind of go out into the world, makeup makes me really confident. I wear a lot on stage for the people all the way in the back. But, I appreciate being without makeup, and I'm really happy that I can still like myself without it.\u201d", "summary": "The singer-songwriter opened up about her beauty journey ahead of this special moment: &#34;MAC reminds me of how glam makeup made me feel my whole life&#34;", "url": "https://people.com/kim-petras-mac-cosmetics-viva-glam-lipstick-ambassador-exclusive-interview-8654935", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/jHb56cW4TLCpKuK-f7iwPG-uTUc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(847x506:849x508)/kim-petras-tout-052824-bb42d6af2fd742d9b2c8074616cdfc48.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:00:00", "author": "Jackie Fields", "authors": ["Jackie Fields"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.462}

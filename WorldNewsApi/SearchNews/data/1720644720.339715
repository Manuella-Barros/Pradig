The triumphant launch of the UK leg of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has seen a surge of fans desperately trying to snag tickets for the \u2018unmissable\u2019 spectacle. The pop legend took to the stage in Edinburgh last night for the first of 15 shows around the UK. In the aftermath, with fan and critic reaction unanimously positive about every aspect of the show, there has been a surge of up to 30,000 fans an hour turning to resale sites today clamouring to scoop up the final last-minutes tickets. Meanwhile, Swift praised UK fans for their energy, saying they'd been 'beautifully generous' and made her and her crew feel 'wonderfully welcome,' adding: \"Even before we got here, you showed love and passion. We got here and you guys are like this! The volume of singing and dancing, I can't stop looking at the crowd, I'm fully distracted by how great you are.\" READ MORE: How to get Taylor Swift Eras Tour tickets for low prices with 'clear view' of stage Fans had begun queuing at Murrayfield in Edinburgh from 5am to get the best spots at the long-awaited show, covering their sparkling outfits with huge coats to battle the 7 degree chill and drizzly weather as well as, as the crowds increased, dodging a huge flock of seagulls attracted by the litter and also possibly the arrival of a Greggs lorry delivering catering for the huge crew preparing for the show. But if internet reaction was anything to go by it was worth every minute. The Mirror's Laura Armstrong described Swift's performance as 'truly world class.' Meanwhile, Scottish music critic John Dingwall said it was \u2018a spectacle not to be missed\u2019 and \u2018three and a half hours of pure entertainment\u2019 with a buzz unmatched by gigs he\u2019d seen by stars including Oasis, Madonna, Prince, Springsteen, U2 and Michael Jackson. The assembled 70,000-strong crowd were also delighted by the show, which was packed with thrilling and dramatic moments - including several off-the-cuff ones. Fans in the stadium gasped with delight thanks to the inclusion of some classics in the much-loved 'surprise songs' medley section of the show, although the star had to change up the lyrics in Would\u2019ve, Could\u2019ve, Should\u2019ve to flag that a fan in the crowd was in distress, calling on security and show organisers to step in and adding she wouldn't continue until the person in trouble was helped. Shortly afterwards, while playing her guitar during an acoustic section of the show, Swift had to pause following an on-stage blunder she said had never happened before. Meanwhile, in happier scenes a marriage proposal took place during Cardigan, much to the star's delight. The unprecedented excitement about The Eras tour has increased even further now the Cruel Summer star has finally hit UK shores, with fans desperate to catch a glimpse of the star and see the show, which is arguably the most hotly anticipated of a generation. The reaction from fans and critics - currently UK newspapers and magazines reviewing the show have unanimously given it five stars, while dozens of fans on X, Tiktok and Facebook have described it as \u2018the best night ever\u2019 - has seen a surge in demand for tickets for the sold-out shows. There are two further nights in Edinburgh, before the star moves on to Liverpool, Cardiff and eventually London where she's going to play eight consecutive nights at Wembley Stadium. Resale sites such as Viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy tickets from other fans. However, many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure things run smoothly. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand, as a result, fans are buying at their own risk. With that said, Viagogo said: \u201cViagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the freedom to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events, safely and securely, backed by a guarantee.\u201d READ MORE: Taylor Swift review: Debut Eras gig delights fans as star proves herself truly world class However with anticipation around the shows higher than ever it doesn't seem to have dampened enthusiasm with music lovers, with just 50 tickets on Viagogo left for tonight's Edinburgh show and 136 for tomorrow.

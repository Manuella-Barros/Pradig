A USADA investigation, including obtaining the meat and testing it, along with interviews with the manager of the bakery, Knighton, his girlfriend and his mother, backed up the sprinter's contamination claim.\n\nWhen Knighton qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, he became the youngest male since Jim Ryun in 1964 to make the U.S. Olympic team.

USADA has insisted it has followed the rulebook in all those cases, including making public any violation, even if it did not result in a penalty.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial contamination case in the U.S. involved distance runner Shelby Houlihan, who got banned before the 2021 Olympic trials, even though she claimed her positive test was the result of a burrito she bought that contained meat laced with nandrolone.\n\nHoulihan is currently serving a four-year ban that ends next year.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

A USADA investigation, including obtaining the meat and testing it, along with interviews with the manager of the bakery, Knighton, his girlfriend and his mother, backed up the sprinter's contamination claim.\n\nWhen Knighton qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, he became the youngest male since Jim Ryun in 1964 to make the US Olympic team. He finished fourth in the 200 behind Andre De Grasse, Kenny Bednarek and Noah Lyles.\n\nKnighton finished second behind Lyles at last year's world championships.\n\nContamination cases such as Knighton's aren't unheard of, though they have come under closer scrutiny of late in the wake of a case involving 23 Chinese swimmers whose positive tests for a banned heart medication were deemed to have come because of contamination.\n\nWADA accepted the explanation from Chinese authorities and did not pursue that case, which became public after reporting by The New York Times and the German broadcaster ARD. That decision has been roundly criticised by USADA and others because the initial positives were not made public.\n\nPart of WADA's argument has been to point out contamination cases that originated in the United States -- which have involved everything from meat to dog medicine -- have not always resulted in sanctions. USADA has insisted it has followed the rulebook in all those cases, including making public any violation, even if it did not result in a penalty.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial contamination case in the US involved distance runner Shelby Houlihan, who got banned before the 2021 Olympic trials, even though she claimed her positive test was the result of a burrito she bought that contained meat laced with nandrolone.\n\nHoulihan is currently serving a four-year ban that ends next year.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [],

required by the rules.\"\n\nThe USADA statement said the arbitrator overseeing the case found that Knighton's positive sample was \"most likely caused by the consumption of meat contaminated with

out-of-competition, there are no results to disqualify him, allowing him to retain his results.\n\nThe American sprinter, who was provisionally suspended on 12 April 2024, has had his suspension lifted as he was found not to be at fault and can return to competition immediately.\n\nThe athlete, who was born on 29 January 2004 in Tampa, Florida, will therefore be free to compete in the Olympic

The arbitrator's decision clears him for the U.S. Olympic trials. WADA may still appeal the ruling, but Knighton's attorney is prepared for any potential legal battles.\n\n(Adds response from Knighton's attorney in paragraph 4, details) NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) -\n\nAmerican sprinter Erriyon Knighton will not be suspended for testing positive for a banned substance, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said on Wednesday, after an arbitrator found the result was likely caused by contaminated meat. The finding cleared the 200 metres world silver medallist to compete at the U.S. Olympic trials starting on Friday, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said it could appeal.\n\n\"As it always does, WADA will review this case and reserves the right to take an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, as appropriate,\" WADA's head of media relations James Fitzgerald said.

by consuming meat contaminated with trenbolone.\"\n\nThe agency described trenbolone as \"a known livestock growth promoter that is used legally in beef cattle produced in and exported to the United States.\"\n\nBecause Knighton's test was taken outside of competition, there are no results to disqualify.\n\nThe American sprinter was provisionally suspended on April 12, 2024, a suspension which

WADA criticized US anti-doping chief Travis Tygart of hypocrisy, escalating tensions between US and global anti-doping authorities.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency questioned an arbitrator's decision to clear American sprinter Erriyon Knighton of a doping offence on Thursday, saying it is was considering an appeal while accusing U.S. anti-doping chief Travis Tygart of hypocrisy. Knighton, the 200 metres world championship silver medallist, tested positive for the banned metabolite trenbolone in March during an out-of-competition drug test.\n\nAn independent arbitrator ruled on Wednesday that the positive test was more likely than not caused by consuming meat contaminated with trenbolone, a known livestock growth promoter used legally in beef cattle produced in and exported to the United States. The decision cleared the 20-year-old to compete in the U.S. Olympic trials starting on Friday in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nWADA told Reuters in a statement that it is sceptical of the findings and is awaiting the reasoned decision as it considers an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"Once WADA has the full reasoned decision, it will study that, along with the case file, with its usual scepticism and diligence,\" it said.\n\n\"It will be important, for example, to ascertain how this positive test for trenbolone was caused by meat contamination, which would be extremely rare for that substance.\" In announcing the Knighton ruling, United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) chief Tygart declared that \"justice was served\".\n\nWADA questioned how such a claim can be made without having read the reasoned decision. \"It is difficult to understand how Travis Tygart can declare with such certainty that 'justice was served,\" said WADA. \"In this case, given USADA had argued that the analytical result was incompatible with meat contamination and had originally sought a sanction of four years against the athlete.\"\n\nESCALATING TENSIONS The case is the latest in escalating tensions between the U.S. and global anti-doping authorities ignited by the scandal involving 23 Chinese swimmers, who tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ) before the Tokyo Games but were allowed to compete.\n\nThe swimmers avoided sanctions after an investigation by Chinese authorities ruled the positive tests were the result of being inadvertently exposed to the drug through contamination. A New York Times report last week said three of those 23 had also tested positive for another banned substance, clenbuterol, through ingesting tainted meat in 2016 and 2017, and that two went on to win Olympic gold in Tokyo.\n\nWADA accused Tygart of a double standard for demanding sanctions on Chinese athletes while clearing an American athlete under similar contamination scenarios. \"If this had been an athlete in China, we dare to think that Mr Tygart would be singing a different tune, and very loudly,\" WADA said.\n\nThe Chinese swimmers and Knighton cases are similar in that the positive tests have been said to be the result of contamination. Tygart maintains that the Knighton case was fully transparent and followed anti-doping rules while many questions hang over the Chinese investigation accusing WADA of a coverup.\n\n\"Unlike the China TMZ 23, in this case, as the rules required, we provisionally suspend the athlete, presented the issues before an independent arbitrator, and publicly announced the outcome,\" Tygart said in an email to Reuters. \"It is sad to see but WADA has truly lost it and is crumbling before the world's eyes,\" added the USADA chief.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

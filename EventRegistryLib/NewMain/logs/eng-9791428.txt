Moid Khan is from the Samajwadi Party and is a member of the Ayodhya (Faizabad) MP's team. He has been found involved in the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The Samajwadi Party has not taken any action against him,\" Adityanath said in the assembly on August 1.\n\nThe chief minister also met the girl's family last week.\n\nThe Ayodhya district administration demolished Khan's \"illegal\" bakery on August 3.\n\nThe shifting of the 12-year-old rape survivor took place a day after a three-member Bharatiya Janata Party delegation met her and her family members and urged the state government to raise the compensation amount from Rs 5 lakh to 25 lakh.\n\nRajya Sabha MP Sangeeta Balwant Bind, who was part of the delegation, said her \"blood boiled\" when she heard the girl's ordeal and alleged that the accused had committed similar crimes earlier as well.\n\nThe team held a \"detailed discussion\" with the girl's family members and gathered information about the alleged incident.\n\nThe delegation also included Rajya Sabha MP Baburam Nishad and Narendra Kashyap, Uttar Pradesh's minister of state (independent charge) for backward-class welfare.\n\nNishad told PTI on Sunday, \"The girl is in a critical condition and doctors are giving her the best treatment.\"\n\nAsked whether he suggested that the girl be shifted to a better facility in Lucknow or Delhi, Nishad had said, \"We have told them (doctors) that if you feel that it (treatment) is beyond your control, then the girl should be shifted to a higher centre without any delay.\"", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [{"uri": "senjo_m_r@rediff.com", "name": "Senjo M R", "type": "author",

He also asked the court to take cognizance of the case, as per a statement by the SP.\n\nWhen former minister and SP spokesperson Tej Narain Pandey was asked why no party representative had met the victim, he said: \"The SP delegation wants to meet the victim's family to express grief, but due to the fear of BJP government, we are not able to go...we are afraid that if the SP delegation meets the victim's family, many false cases will get registered against our leaders.\" Input from PTI", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George's_Medical_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King George's Medical University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Teck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mary of Teck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faizabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faizabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Faizabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhadarsa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Adityanath", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/05/1600x900/On-July-30--police-arrested-Moid-Khan--who-ran-a-b_1722886581053.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791428", "eventUri": "eng-9791428", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1095, "textEnd": 1102}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1710, "textEnd": 1718}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

He added that a team of doctors comprising the ACMO accompanied the girl during her transit to the state capital.\n\nAccording to KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh, the victim was admitted at Queen Mary hospital of the medical university and that she was under the treatment of Dr Sujata Dey. \"The victim is being provided with all the best treatment facilities,\" said Dr Singh. Notably, in a big embarrassment to the Samajwadi Party, its senior leader Moid Khan, a resident of Pura Kalandar area of Ayodhya, and party's city chief of Bhadarsa, was arrested by district police, on last Thursday, on charges of raping the minor girl for over two months and making her pregnant.\n\nKhan had been indulging in the criminal act along with his house help Raju Khan. They also allegedly video recorded the act and were blackmailing the victim who used to work as a daily wage employee at Khan's home. Moreover, Ayodhya the district authorities and Ayodhya Development Authority officials demolished the illegally constructed bakery of Moid Khan. \"The action was taken as the bakery was constructed on a land grabbed by the accused. The house of the accused may also be demolished,\" said an official. UP CM, a number of UP government ministers and BJP leader have been meeting the girl's family assuring them all help and security.\n\nMeanwhile, both Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and his party's MP from Ayodhya Awadhesh Prasad, reiterated the demand for getting a DNA test of the rape survivor to establish the complicity of the accused in the crime. While interacting with the media persons on Monday, the SP chief said that it was the bounden duty of the state government to provide security to victim.\n\nHe urged the courts to take suo moto notice of the case and order the DNA test of the victim to ensure justice to all. Raising doubts on the intention of the state government, the SP chief said concerted efforts were being done to malign the image of Samajwadi Party instead of ensuring justice to all. \"Those who have been accused of this crime should also be made to undergo a DNA test to pave way for justice instead of playing politics over the issue by levelling charges,\" said the SP chief adding that whosoever was found guilty of the crime should be punished as per the law. He said that if the allegations against the accused stood false, the government servants involved in levelling the false charges should not be spared.\n\nSimilarly, Ayodhya SP Awadhesh Prasad demanded death sentence to the guilty of the crime he claimed that the SP had also set up a high-level committee to investigate the matter on its level. The Ayodhya MP also demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the victim. At the same time, the victim's family is living under the shadow of fear claiming that they were still getting the life threats from the accused accomplices.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@newindianexpress.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George's_Medical_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "King George's Medical University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhadarsa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhadarsa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-05%2Fec5818c5-cb25-4398-8355-696178607eae%2FANI_20240501100721.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791428", "eventUri": "eng-9791428", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The incident came to light when the girl was taken to a hospital after she complained of stomach pain. The doctors there confirmed that she was pregnant.\n\nOn July 30, both the accused were arrested and sent to jail.\n\n\"The investigation is going on. We are prepared to conduct DNA tests to strengthen the case against the accused,\" said a senior police officer.\n\nThe Opposition Samajwadi Party, which is being targeted by the ruling BJP over the issue, has been demanding a DNA test \"to clear the picture\" of the rape charge. The SP has also demanded Rs 20 lakh compensation for the girl and her family. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said the BJP was using the case to \"defame\" his party ahead of the Assembly bypolls in the state.\n\nLast Friday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath met the girl's mother in Lucknow and assured her of all possible help. On Saturday, the Ayodhya district administration demolished the bakery owned by the accused, saying that it was built illegally on a pond.\n\nOn Sunday, a three-member delegation of BJP leaders met the girl and her family members.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manish_sahu@indianexpress.com", "name": "Manish Sahu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Adityanath", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/police-van-2.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791428", "eventUri": "eng-9791428", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1253, "textEnd": 1260}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1614, "textEnd": 1621}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

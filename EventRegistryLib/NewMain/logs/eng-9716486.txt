The youngest to have played for Spain, he became the youngest player ever in the ongoing European Championship in Germany.\n\nThe long-forgotten photo from 2007 resurfaced after Yamal's father posted it on Instagram last week with the text \"the beginning of two legends.\"\n\nAlso Read | Wimbledon 2024: Jelena Ostapenko Makes It to Third Quarter-Final, Elena Rybakina and Elina Svitolina Also Advance.\n\nMonfort, 56, who works as a freelance photographer for The Associated Press and others, said the photo shoot took place in the visitors' locker room at Barcelona's Camp Nou in the autumn of 2007, when Yamal was just a few months old.\n\nBarcelona players posed with children and their families for a calendar as part of an annual charity drive by local newspaper Diario Sport and UNICEF. Monfort was in charge of the photo shoots -- and it just so happened that Messi was paired with Yamal's family. His mother, who is from Equatorial Guinea, is next to Messi and the baby in one of the photos.\n\n\"We made the calendar with the help of UNICEF. So UNICEF did a raffle in the neighborhood of Roca Fonda in Matar\u00f3 where Lamine's family lived. They signed up for the raffle to have their picture taken at the Camp Nou with a Barca player. And they won the raffle,\" Monfort said.\n\nIt wasn't an easy assignment, he recalled, mainly because Messi wasn't sure how to interact with baby Lamine, who was in a plastic tub for the shoot.\n\n\"Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he's shy,\" Monfort said. \"He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he finds himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn't even know how to hold him at first.\"\n\nMessi was 20 at the time and already considered a big talent, but it would take a couple of years before he made his mark as the most outstanding player of his generation for Barcelona and Argentina.\n\nLike Messi, Yamal has gone through Barcelona's renowned La Masia youth academy. Despite his age, he's been one of Spain's best players at Euro 2024, where his team will play France in the semifinals on Tuesday. Yamal will turn 17 on Saturday, the day before the final in Berlin.\n\nMonfort, 56, had no idea it was Yamal in those photos from 2007 until a friend messaged him as they started trending online.\n\nHe's had a long career as a sports photographer since 1991, following Barcelona around the world, but said he's never experienced this level of excitement around any of his

The youngest to have played for Spain, he became the youngest player ever in the ongoing European Championship in Germany.\n\nThe long-forgotten photo from 2007 resurfaced after Yamal's father posted it on Instagram last week with the text \"the beginning of two legends.\"\n\nMonfort, 56, who works as a freelance photographer for The Associated Press and others, said the photo shoot took place in the visitors' locker room at Barcelona's Camp Nou in the autumn of 2007, when Yamal was just a few months old.\n\nBarcelona players posed with children and their families for a calendar as part of an annual charity drive by local newspaper Diario Sport and UNICEF. Monfort was in charge of the photo shoots -- and it just so happened that Messi was paired with Yamal's family. His mother, who is from Equatorial Guinea, is next to Messi and the baby in one of the photos.\n\n\"We made the calendar with the help of UNICEF. So UNICEF did a raffle in the neighborhood of Roca Fonda in Matar\u00f3 where Lamine's family lived. They signed up for the raffle to have their picture taken at the Camp Nou with a Barca player. And they won the raffle,\" Monfort said.\n\nIt wasn't an easy assignment, he recalled, mainly because Messi wasn't sure how to interact with baby Lamine, who was in a plastic tub for the shoot.\n\n\"Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he's shy,\" Monfort said. \"He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he finds himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn't even know how to hold him at first.\"\n\nMessi was 20 at the time and already considered a big talent, but it would take a couple of years before he made his mark as the most outstanding player of his generation for Barcelona and Argentina.\n\nLike Messi, Yamal has gone through Barcelona's renowned La Masia youth academy. Despite his age, he's been one of Spain's best players at Euro 2024, where his team will play France in the semifinals on Tuesday.

Just hours earlier, Yamal, the teenager from Spain, became the youngest player ever to score in the European Championship when he netted a goal in a 2-0 win against France. He will turn 17 on Saturday -- one day before the final.\n\nThe players have been linked before as Yamal currently stars for FC Barcelona and Messi suited up for the organization for nearly two decades. But heartwarming pictures of them together over 16 years ago have reemerged after Yamal's father shared one of the images on his Instagram account last week. He captioned the photo \"the beginning of two greats.\"\n\nJoan Monfort, a freelance photographer for The Associated Press, took the original photos. He told the AP that the photoshoot took place in the visitors' locker room at Camp Nou in 2007 when Yamal was a few months old.\n\nMessi, then 20 years old and playing for Barcelona, held Yamal in one of the photographs. In a different photo, Messi's bathing young Yamal in a plastic tub. There's also a picture of Yamal's mother, Sheila Ebana, with Messi together as they bathed the child.\n\nPlayers with Barcelona posed with children and their families for a calendar as part of an annual charity drive by Spanish newspaper Diario Sport and UNICEF. Monfort was in charge of the photoshoots and Messi was paired with Yamal's family.\n\n\"We made the calendar with the help of UNICEF,\" Monfort said. \"So UNICEF did a raffle in the neighborhood of Roca Fonda in Matar\u00f3 where Lamine's family lived.

The image features a 20-year-old Lionel Messi, already a rising star at Barcelona, holding a six-month-old Lamine Yamal. Today, Yamal, at just 16, has become a soccer sensation for both Spain and Barcelona.\n\nThe photo, captured by Joan Monfort, was taken in the dressing room of the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona, Spain, and has now gone viral. In addition to the sentiment and admiration sparked by the photograph, people online are affectionately referring to the moment as \"baptised by GOAT.\"\n\nMessi and Yamal are currently making headlines for their performances in the Copa America and Euro 2024, respectively. Messi recently scored Argentina's second goal against Canada, securing their spot in the final. Meanwhile, Yamal became the youngest scorer in a Euro, netting a sublime shot in the 21st minute.\n\nThe backstory of the photo is just as captivating. It was taken for a charity calendar nearly 17 years ago and resurfaced when Yamal's father posted it on Instagram with the caption, \"the beginning of two legends.\"\n\nFreelance photographer Joan Monfort recounted the photo shoot, which took place in the visitors' locker room at Camp Nou in the fall of 2007. The shoot was part of an annual charity drive by local newspaper Diario Sport and UNICEF, where Barcelona players posed with children and their families.\n\nYamal's family won a raffle organised by UNICEF in their neighbourhood of Roca Fonda in Mataro, allowing them to participate in the photo shoot with Messi.\n\nMonfort recalled the challenge of the assignment, particularly because Messi, known for his introverted nature, was unsure how to interact with baby Yamal, who was in a plastic tub for the shoot.\n\n\"Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he's shy,\" Monfort said. \"He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he found himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn't even know how to hold him at first.\"\n\nAt the time, Messi was already seen as a prodigious talent, but it would take a few more years for him to establish himself as the preeminent player of his generation. Similarly, Yamal has progressed through Barcelona's renowned La Masia youth academy and has been one of Spain's standout players at Euro 2024.\n\nSpain is set to play France in the semifinals on Tuesday, and Yamal will celebrate his 17th birthday the day before the final in Berlin.\n\nMonfort, who has been a sports photographer since 1991, had no idea the baby in the photos was Yamal until a friend alerted him as the images went viral. Reflecting on the newfound excitement surrounding his photos, Monfort said, \"It's very exciting to be associated with something that has caused such a sensation.

On Thursday, Yamal scored a world-class goal to help Spain defeat France and qualify for the final of the tournament. Yamal, who is a product of the famed La Masia academy in Barcelona, is merely 16 years old. With the talent, it is not a surprise that he is getting compared to Lionel Messi. A photo of baby Lamine Yamal with Messi has been gaining a lot of attention on social media. But is the photo correct? Here's the truth behind the picture.\n\nNearly 17 years ago, Joan Monfort took this picture for a charitable calendar when Lamal was just a few months old. After Yamal's father shared the long-lost pictures from 2007 on Instagram last week with the caption \"the beginning of two legends,\" they have since come to light again.\n\nThe photo shoot, according to 56-year-old freelance photographer Monfort, happened in Barcelona's Camp Nou's visitors' locker room in 2007.\n\nAs part of an annual charity campaign organized by UNICEF and the local newspaper Diario Sport, Barcelona players posed for a calendar alongside kids and their families. The photo shoots were overseen by Monfort, who coincidentally paired Messi with Yamal's family. In one of the pictures, his mother, who is from Equatorial Guinea, is standing next to Messi and the child.\n\nMonfort recalled how Messi struggled during the photos, not knowing how to interact with the child.\n\n\"Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he's shy,\" Monfort said. \"He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he finds himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn't even know how to hold him at first.\"\n\nMessi was regarded as a huge talent at the age of 20.

He became the youngest player to score during the Euros when his decisive left boot helped Spain beat France in their semifinal Tuesday. Spain will face England or the Netherlands in the final Sunday.\n\nMessi, meanwhile, continues to shine during the twilight of his legendary career. He will lead Argentina to its second straight Copa America final on Sunday, against Colombia or Uruguay.\n\nNearly 17 years later, the two FC Barcelona standouts remain virtuously linked together through photos that now seem prophesying to many, who believe Yamal was baptized or anointed by Messi as a child.\n\n\"It's very exciting to be associated with something that has caused such a sensation,\" the photographer, Joan Monfort, told the Associated Press this week. \"To tell you the truth, it's a very nice feeling.\"\n\nYamal's father posted a photo last week of his son, Messi and Yamal's mother Sheila Ebana on Instagram with the caption: \"The beginning of two legends.\"\n\nThe photos were taken by freelance photographer Joan Monfort.

His father is from Morocco, while his mother is from Equatorial Guinea. He was first scouted by FC Barcelona around the age of 6 in 2014, according to this ESPN profile.\n\nYamal signed a three-year deal in Oct. 2023, through June 2026, to remain with FC Barcelona. The deal also came with an astronomical buyout of $1.05 billion to fend off other clubs.\n\nWhen Yamal turns 18, he'll sign another contract with Barcelona through June 2030, according to Spanish newspaper Sport.\n\nParis Saint-Germain and Manchester City reportedly were also interested in signing Yamal.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamal_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yamal Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matar\u00f3", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matar\u00f3"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matar\u00f3"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equatorial Guinea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Equatorial Guinea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716486", "eventUri": "eng-9716486", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

We can say I sweated some blood to take it.\n\n\"Messi is still shy now; he was much more shy when he was starting out and he finds himself there with a tiny baby in a plastic bath full of water. And with his mother. At the start, there was not much interaction. It was difficult for all of them. But, bit by bit, it started to happen and in the end, it's a pretty good photo,\" Monfort told The Athletic.\n\nThe photo was featured in a 2008 charity calendar, a collaborative project between Barcelona's foundation and Diario Sport, with proceeds benefiting various charitable organisations, including UNICEF and local NGOs in Catalonia, supporting vulnerable communities and children.\n\nThe charity calendar featured photos of Barcelona players alongside children.\n\nThe Athletic reports that \"hundreds of families collaborated with the initiative for a number of years and most of the photos have now been forgotten, outside of the families of the children who have treasured private memories.\"\n\nIn a remarkable twist of fate, Yamal, Barcelona's budding sensation, was paired with Messi, now a beloved club icon.\n\n\"It's something incredible. Back then, nobody could imagine that this baby would be who he is now -- and you could not have known that Messi would become who he became, either,\" Monfort said.\n\nThe bathtime photo, along with other tender moments from the photoshoot have now resurfaced. The rediscovered images show Messi tenderly cradling baby Yamal in a towel and Yamal's mother, Sheila Ebana, playfully washing her son.\n\nIn December 2007, Messi was still a rising star in a star-studded Barcelona squad, having already won two La Liga titles and a Champions League at just 20 years old.\n\n\"They gave you a list of players -- 12: one for each month.\n\n\"You have to take your time. Often footballers come in and say, 'Let's go, let's do it. I'm in a rush; what do you want to do?'.\n\n\"It can be a bit cold, especially in a photo where you need interaction between two people who do not know each other. Then, when one is six months old and the other is 20, it can get difficult, but it turned out pretty well.\n\n\"The mother helped a lot. Her presence was super necessary, so the baby did not feel it was too strange. You look for a tender image -- something sweet and nice,\" Monfort stated.\n\nFast forward six and a half years, Yamal's life took a significant turn when he began commuting from Mataro to Barcelona's iconic La Masia academy.\n\nHe made his La Liga debut at just 15 years old in April 2023, followed by his international debut for Spain at 16\n\n\"For Lamine to grow up to be a footballer, and to have this photo, I'm just really happy it happened.

But in a bizarre coincidence, he once posed with soccer legend Lionel Messi when he was just six months old alongside his mom.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the photo came about in 2007 when FC Barcelona players made a charity calendar for local newspaper Diario Sport and Unicef. There was a raffle to find children and families who would pose with the players and Yamal's family happened to win.\n\nBack then, Messi was 20 years old and while he was a very exciting talent, he was not yet the outstanding player of his generation or GOAT as he is known today.\n\n\"Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he's shy,\" photographer Joan Monfort says of the awkward photo shoot in which he says Messi was unsure of how to interact with baby Yamal.\n\n\"He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he finds himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn't even know how to hold him at first.\"\n\nFans joked that Yamal's early encounter with Messi was a \"blessing\" and it is the reason why Lamal is so successful at such a young age.\n\n\"Greatness touched a baby, and the baby is on his way to greatness as well,\" remarked one person.\n\nThe photos were shot, presumably published, and forgotten about until Yamal's father shared the photo with the caption, \"The beginning of two legends.\"\n\nJust like Messi, Yamal trained at Barcelona's famous La Masia youth academy. The similarities don't end there: While Yamal will play in the semi-final of a major soccer tournament today so will Messi who is likely to play against Canada in the semi-final of the Copa America for Argentina this evening.\n\nYamal has impressed at Euros 2024 so far, notching up the most assists of any player in the tournament. If he scores a goal he will become the youngest player ever to do so.\n\nThe photographer, Monfort, says he is really surprised the photo has gone viral but is pleased his family was able to keep a copy that he gave them.\n\n\"It's very exciting to be associated with something that has caused such a sensation,\" the photographer says. \"To tell you the truth it's a very nice feeling.\"", "source": {"uri": "petapixel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PetaPixel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_growcoot@petapixel.com", "name": "Matt Growcoot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamal_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yamal Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/Messi-Yamal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716486", "eventUri": "eng-9716486", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

We can say I sweated some blood to take it.\n\n\"Messi is still shy now; he was much more shy when he was starting out and he finds himself there with a tiny baby in a plastic bath full of water. And with his mother. At the start, there was not much interaction. It was difficult for all of them. But, bit by bit, it started to happen and, in the end, it's a pretty good photo,\" Monfort told The Athletic.\n\nThe photo was featured in a 2008 charity calendar, a collaborative project between Barcelona's foundation and Diario Sport, with proceeds benefiting various charitable organisations, including UNICEF and local NGOs in Catalonia, supporting vulnerable communities and children.\n\nThe charity calendar featured photos of Barcelona players alongside children.\n\nThe Athletic reports that \"hundreds of families collaborated with the initiative for a number of years and most of the photos have now been forgotten, outside of the families of the children who have treasured private memories.\n\nIn a remarkable twist of fate, Yamal, Barcelona's budding sensation, was paired with Messi, now a beloved club icon.\n\n\"It's something incredible. Back then, nobody could imagine that this baby would be who he is now -- and you could not have known that Messi would become who he became, either,\" Monfort said.\n\nThe bathtime photo, along with other tender moments from the photoshoot have now resurfaced. The rediscovered images show Messi tenderly cradling baby Yamal in a towel and Yamal's mother, Sheila Ebana, playfully washing her son.\n\nIn December 2007, Messi was still a rising star in a star-studded Barcelona squad, having already won two La Liga titles and a Champions League at just 20 years old.\n\n\"They gave you a list of players -- 12: one for each month.\n\n\"You have to take your time.

However, what makes this particular photograph so unique is that Lamine appears to be barely out of the womb.\n\nFreelance photographer Joan Monfort captured the now viral photo for a charity calendar 17 year ago.\n\nAccording to a report in The Guardian Monfort foresaw Messi's future success in football but had no idea the baby would also rise to prominence.\n\nIn autumn 2007, Monfort, 56, organised a charity photoshoot at Barcelona's Camp Nou. The event, part of an annual charity drive by\n\nDiario Sport and Unicef, involved Barcelona players posing with children and their families.\n\nMessi was paired with the family of Yamal, who was just a few months old.\n\nMonfort recalled the challenging shoot in an interview with The Guardian. He said Messi, being shy and introverted, was unsure how to interact with the baby, who was in a plastic tub. Yamal's family won the opportunity through a raffle held by Unicef in their Matar\u00f3 neighbourhood.\n\nThe teen sensation is currently shining at the Euro 2024 tournament with Spain. Yamal like Messi, was nurtured by the renowned La Masia academy, joining at the age of seven.\n\nEarlier today, Yamal became the youngest scorer at a Euro or World Cup tournament. The 16-year-old canceled out Randal Kolo Muani's opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute.\n\nDani Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage sending Spain to the finals.\n\nThe tricky winger has already played 51 times for Barcelona, scoring seven goals.\n\nThe previous youngest player at the Euros was Poland's Kacper Kozlowski -- 17 years and 246 days -- in a 1-1 group-stage draw against Spain in Seville in June 2021, Yamal could break a few more records in the coming days.", "source": {"uri": "malaysia.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "malay_mail@malaysia.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Malay Mail", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamal_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yamal Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_Kolo_Muani", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randal Kolo Muani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matar\u00f3", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matar\u00f3"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matar\u00f3"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/718f0f0b433e37a4f7b19785e01559cc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716486", "eventUri": "eng-9716486", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 14, "textEnd": 21}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The photo was initially highlighted by Yamal's father, Mounir Nasraoui, on Instagram.\n\nMy initial reaction was probably as shocked as you are right now:\n\nGah, I still can't process this.\n\nIt is just so bonkers for someone as legendary as Messi to actually have this kind of early contact with Yamal, someone who may well become iconic soon in their own right. It is the trope of sports stars meeting their heroes in old photos taken to the absolute extreme. In an American context, this would be like prime Tom Brady meeting Patrick Mahomes as a toddler at a random dinner party.\n\nAccording to Dermot Corrigan of The Athletic, Messi's chance meeting with Yamal wasn't so random by design. It's just that photographer Joan Monfort didn't quite realize it would eventually turn out to be an incredible twist of fate.\n\nVia The Athletic:\n\nIn December 2007, Montfort took a photo of a 20-year-old Lionel Messi, who had begun his legendary Barcelona career just over four years earlier, and Lamine Yamal -- who was just six months old. It was published in a 2008 charity calendar organised by Barcelona's club foundation and Catalan newspaper Diario Sport, with the money raised going to charitable organisations including UNICEF and different NGOs around Catalonia. Members of the Barcelona squad were photographed alongside children. Hundreds of families collaborated with the initiative for a number of years and most of the photos have now been forgotten, outside of the families of the children who have treasured private memories. It just so happens that Yamal, Barca's teenage star of the future, ended up paired with the man who would go on to win the Ballon d'Or eight times.\n\nYou're telling me that Yamal, someone who many think will help define men's soccer for the next decade-plus, happened to be randomly paired with one of the greatest athletes of all time in a Barcelona charity photo shoot?\n\nY'all ... WHAT?\n\nNow I'm just hoping Yamal helps lead Spain to its fourth-ever European championship, and we can really jumpstart the way-too-early and anointed \"next GOAT\" talks.\n\nDestiny is real, dearest readers. After seeing this, don't you dare deny it.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_zeglinski@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Zeglinski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamal_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yamal Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul McCartney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/07/USATSI_4736128-e1720464832760.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716486", "eventUri": "eng-9716486", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-12-", "textStart": 1490, "textEnd": 1503}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nLamine Yamal, the 16-year-old Spain and Barcelona prodigy, was once held by Camp Nou legend Lionel Messi as part of a charity calendar when he was just an infant.\n\nThe young forward has already made a name for himself as one of the most promising talents of his generation following his impressive performances for Spain at Euro 2024. The La Masia graduate has broken several records at the tournament, becoming the youngest player to ever participate and also score in the championships with a goal against France in the semi-final.\n\nYamal etched his name into the annals of football history when he played against Croatia at the tender age of just 16 years and 338 days, also contributing three assists so far in the tournament. However, his first brush with football fame came when he was only five months old during a photoshoot with Messi in December 2007.\n\nAlmost 17 years ago, Messi, then just 20 years old and yet to win a World Cup, participated in a charity event with Spanish newspaper Diario Sport to raise funds for charities including UNICEF. During the photoshoot, the Argentine forward held and even bathed baby Yamal in a series of photographs taken by Joan Monfort, reports the Mirror.\n\nIn an unexpected twist of fate, that toddler would eventually become a star player for Barcelona and an internationally recognised name. Monfort, the photographer who captured the unforgettable moment, recounted to The Athletic: \"It was a difficult photo to take. We can say I sweated some blood to take it.\n\n\"(Lionel) Messi is still shy now; he was much more shy when he was starting out and he finds himself there with a tiny baby in a plastic bath full of water,\" he continued, describing the scene which played out. \"And with his mother. At the start, there was not much interaction. It was difficult for all of them. But, bit by bit, it started to happen and in the end, it's a pretty good photo.\"\n\nAfter Yamal's father later shared the images on social media, they caused quite a stir. Reflecting on the unexpected popularity of his photos, Monfort exclaimed: \"It's something incredible.\n\n\"Back then, nobody could imagine that this baby would be who he is now - and you could not have known that Messi would become who he became, either. We are talking about 2007. Messi was only beginning at Barca then. Destiny plays an important role in these things.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's a one-in-a-million chance that this could happen. It's such good fortune. These days, it happens a bit more as people have their phones and share photos, but this is like the photo of [Pep] Guardiola as a kid applauding Terry Venables being carried on players' shoulders. When Venables died, Pep posted the image.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_ireland@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Shane Ireland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry Venables"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29510688.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2160741044.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716486", "eventUri": "eng-9716486", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-12-", "textStart": 991, "textEnd": 1004}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Lionel Messi and Lamine Yamal had something in common in the past 24 hours: Both the players scored for their respective national teams to take them to the finals, one being Copa America 2024, with the other being Euro Cup 2024. Yamal, in fact set a world record for being the youngest player ever to score a goal at the Euro championship history. He achieved this feat after scoring an equalizing goal for Spain and putting them back in the game after they were lagging by a goal, scored by France in the ninth minute itself.\n\nAs 16-years-old Yamal entered the history books, pictures of him with Lionel Messi surfaced on social media but they came with a rather sweet twist.

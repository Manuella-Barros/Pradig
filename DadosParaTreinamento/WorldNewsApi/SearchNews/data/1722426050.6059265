{"id": 243274414, "title": "Stu Cowan: NHL Draft could be very memorable night for Canadiens", "text": "Dion then walked toward the stage holding hands with the oldest of her three sons, Ren\u00e9-Charles. \u201cWith the fifth overall selection in the 2024 NHL Draft, the Montreal Canadiens are proud to select \u2026 Ivan Demidov,\u201d Dion announced. It was a smart pick by the Canadiens, who must get more offence from their forwards and Demidov can bring that. It was a brilliant move to have Dion make the announcement. Demidov, a 6-foot, 192-pound Russian winger, was ranked No. 2 among international skaters by NHL Central Scouting behind defenceman Anton Silayev, who went to the New Jersey Devils with the No. 10 pick. TSN draft guru Bob McKenzie had Demidov ranked No. 2 overall behind forward Macklin Celebrini, who as expected went to the San Jose Sharks with the No. 1 overall pick. The Chicago Blackhawks took defenceman Artyom Levshunov with the No. 2 pick, the Anaheim Ducks took winger Beckett Sennecke at No. 3 and the Columbus Blue Jackets took centre Cayden Lindstrom at No. 4 before the Canadiens and C\u00e9line took the stage. Demidov posted 23-37-60 totals in 30 games last season with the St. Petersburg junior team in Russia. He was held pointless in four games with the St. Petersburg KHL team and has one year remaining on his contract with that club. That means the 18-year-old won\u2019t be able to join the Canadiens before the 2025-26 season. Demidov doesn\u2019t have a Canadian visa \u2014 only an American one \u2014 so he won\u2019t be able to attend the Canadiens\u2019 development camp, which opens next Tuesday in Brossard.", "summary": "Habs bring out C\u00e9line Dion in Las Vegas to announce Ivan Demidov as the No. 5 overall pick and add more offence with Michael Hage at No. 21.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/stu-cowan-nhl-draft-could-be-a-very-memorable-night-for-canadiens", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2159739476.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:51:43", "author": "Montreal Gazette,Stu Cowan", "authors": ["Montreal Gazette", "Stu Cowan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.253}

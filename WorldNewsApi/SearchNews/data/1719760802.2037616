[+] on the facade of the Galeries Lafayette, famous department store of Paris, France getty Chanel just announced revenues rose 16% to $19.7 billion in 2023 on a comparable basis at constant currency. It exceeded the 14% organic growth of industry leader LVMH\u2019s Fashion and Leather Goods reporting segment but fell short of Herm\u00e8s\u2019 21% advance on constant exchange rates, yet it surpassed Herm\u00e8s in revenues of $14.5 billion (\u20ac13.4 billion). Chanel still has a way to go to catch up to LVMH\u2019s $45.8 billion (\u20ac42.2 billion) fashion and leather goods\u2019 business, but then the group includes 14 brands, not one. While LVMH doesn\u2019t report results at the brand level, industry consensus is Louis Vuitton is far and away the industry\u2019s number one brand; however, we can only guess how far ahead it is from Chanel. Yet, there is no question that Chanel holds the industry\u2019s number two poll position, but Herm\u00e8s is narrowing the gap. Since 2019, when Virginie Viard took over as creative director after the passing of Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel was 1.6 times larger than Herm\u00e8s \u2013 $12.3 billion compared to Herm\u00e8s at $7.5 billion (\u20ac6.9 billion). In 2023, it dropped to 1.35 times larger. And in those five years, Herm\u00e8s had a compound-annual-growth-rate (CAGR) of 14.3% while Chanel trailed at 10%. If current trends continue, Herm\u00e8s will be just about level with Chanel by the end of this decade or early part of the next and then begin to more ahead. Cost Of Growth For now CEO Leena Nair, who joined Chanel in January 2022 from chief human resources officer at Unilever, is confident Chanel has what it takes to stay out in front.

In the last decade, we have more than doubled our revenue and more than doubled our headcount. In the last five years, we doubled the size of our distribution network,\u201d she shared in a call with Laure Guilbault of Vogue Business. Neither Chanel or Herm\u00e8s provided comment before posting. Chanel now has over 600 boutiques and employs more than 36,500 people. Herm\u00e8s, by contrast, operates some 300 stores and has about 22,000 employees. Herm\u00e8s\u2019 leaner footprint translates into greater profitability. Chanel had an operating profit of $6.4 billion or 32% of revenues compared to Herm\u00e8s\u2019 margin of 42% on $6.1 billion (\u20ac$5.7 billion) operating income. Uneven Market Performance Chanel CFO Philippe Blondiaux, who joined Nair on the Vogue Business call said, \u201cSales increased in all markets, with double-digit growth across all categories and momentum continued into the final quarter,\u201d as he detailed growth in its major markets. However, the company\u2019s performance in key markets was uneven, compared to Herm\u00e8s, which performed on par everywhere. Chanel bested Herm\u00e8s\u2019 growth in the Asia-Pacific market, up 22% versus 20% constant exchange rates. Asia-Pacific is Herm\u00e8s\u2019 largest market, accounting for 56% of revenues; Chanel didn\u2019t report distribution by market. On the European front, Herm\u00e8s had the advantage, up 20% versus 16.4% for Chanel. Herm\u00e8s derived 23% of revenues there. It was in the Americas where Chanel and Herm\u00e8s diverged. Chanel advanced only 2.6% on this side of the pond compared with 17% for Herm\u00e8s. Herm\u00e8s generated some 19% of revenues here. The U.S. market, in particular, has been hard hit by inflation that has crimped the luxury spending power among the so-called aspirational HENRY (high-earners-not-rich-yet) consumers. Results would suggest that Chanel is more exposed to that consumer segment than Herm\u00e8s. Beauty is often the aspirational consumers\u2019 gateway into luxury, and Chanel is more heavily vested in the cosmetics category than Herm\u00e8s. Beauty Packaging magazine estimates Chanel generated some $6.5 billion in perfumes and cosmetics last year. Herm\u00e8s brought in only $534 million in the category and its beauty sales rose 10% year-over-year. One wonders how Chanel\u2019s recently launched 31 Le Rouge refillable lipstick will go over priced at $195 and touted as the most expensive lipstick ever, when other Chanel lipsticks can be had for around $50. Refills at $90 also carry a hefty price premium. That the 31 Le Rouge lipstick is the first ever presented in a glass case is a distinction without a difference. Disrupting The Price-Value Relationship In the Vogue Business call, CFO Blondiaux slipped that a significant portion of Chanel\u2019s topline growth was credited to price increases, rather than volume growth. \u201cThe breakdown of the 16% top-line growth we had in 2023 was 9% pricing and 7% volume, more or less.\u201d And he hinted at further price increases to come in September, after one went into effect in March. \u201cIt\u2019s simply reflecting two points, which is the inflation of the cost of our materials \u2013 which are exclusive, very scarce and by definition, expensive \u2013 and as well reflecting our price-organisation policy, which is when currencies fluctuate, we readjust our prices around the world. That\u2019s how we adjust our prices twice a year,\u201d he said. Herm\u00e8s is impacted by the same fluctuating economic factors and while it has raised prices recently, it hasn\u2019t gotten the blowback on the street that Chanel has. The medium classic Chanel flap bag now retails for $10,800, more than double the $5,000 price in 2013. \u201cEven die-hard Chanel fans criticize the brand\u2019s multi-year spike in bag prices,\u201d writes Maura Carlin, editor of PurseBop. \u201cQuestioning whether Chanel classic flaps are worth the price has become the sport of social media influencers. As the Chanel prices inch ever closer to parity with those of Herm\u00e8s famous quota bags \u2013 the Birkin 25 price is $600 more than the Chanel Medium Classic Flap \u2013 many wonder \u2018Which would you rather?\u2019\u201d The consensus is one would rather the Birkin, if you\u2019ve got the cash in hand and you can find it \u2013 a big if. Unsustainable Growth Susanna Nicoletti, longtime luxury industry consultant and editor of the SUN Deluxe newsletter on Substack, questions why a private company \u2013 owned by brothers Alain and Gerard Wertheimer with $37.2 billion net worth and ranked number 42 in Forbes billionaires list \u2013 would want to push so hard for growth and that coming mainly by price increases. \u201cGrowing in this way so quickly puts at serious risk the brand equity of Chanel,\u201d she shared with me. \u201cThere is no objective reason for a totally private company to push in this way to double revenues at such a pace. Chanel is not only increasing revenues by price increases instead of sales; it is also growing excessively the fixed costs of the organization.\u201d Nicoletti says Chanel should take a lesson from Gucci\u2019s rapid rise from 2016 to 2019 under creative director Alessandro Michele and CEO Marco Bizzarri and its subsequent fall from grace, resulting in both being let go. \u201cAs we\u2019ve already learned from troubled business of previously prestigious brands such as Gucci, growth needs to be carefully managed at proper speed, \u201cshe observed. \u201cUnlike conglomerate Kering, which owns Gucci, Chanel does not have the pressure of shareholders and they should not be so eager to grow at the speed of light.\u201d She warned, \u201cThe impact of this growth in the medium term could turn Chanel into the next Gucci 2024.\u201d Steep Learning Curve Nicoletti sees the only logical explanation for Chanel\u2019s aggressive posture is to either sell or list it on the stock exchange, both options Chanel has repeatedly and forcefully rejected in the past. Yet bringing in a professional manager like Nair from a CPG giant like Unilever, with no fashion \u2013 let alone luxury \u2013 experience, belies those claims. Even if Nair simply wanted to prove the Wertheimer brothers made the right CEO choice, she still has a learning curve ahead coming from a mass-market consumer product company such as Unilever. The luxury market operates under an entirely different set of rules. A luxury brand like Chanel functions under the Veblen Goods economic model where goods are often bought to signal social status. Economist Thorstein Veblen coined the phrase \u201cconspicuous consumption\u201d in his seminal book The Theory of the Leisure Class in 1899. Despite protests to the contrary \u2013 few will admit they buy a luxury brand as a status symbol, considering it too \u201cnouveau riche\u201d \u2013 the status signaling power of a luxury brand is an underlying motivation for many luxury consumers, even if they refuse to admit it. Under the Veblen model, distribution must be tightly managed to build greater aspiration for the brand. Yes, raising prices is part of conferring luxury aspirational status to a brand, but only a small part. The heavy lifting is done by creating and maintaining a mysterious allure around the brand with success measured over the long, not the short term. Allowing the luxury brand to become too commonplace can kill it. Having 600 points of distribution versus 300 for Herm\u00e8s suggests Chanel may be overstepping its exclusive boundaries. Nair\u2019s boast of doubling sales and Chanel\u2019s distribution network are metrics that any CEO of a consumer product goods company would be proud of; in luxury, it\u2019s questionable. She also revealed plans to increase capital expenditure by 50% with more real estate and retail investments. \u201cThere\u2019s a real risk to luxury brands that are treated as a pure financial asset,\u201d Nicoletti warned. \u201cNair still talks about scaling up the business as if intoxicated by Chanel\u2019s own volatile success. They should look at Herm\u00e8s instead.\u201d Passing The Torch For Herm\u00e8s chairman Axel Dumas, luxury is in his blood. Born in 1970, Dumas is a great-grandson of \u00c9mile Herm\u00e8s and a sixth-generation family member responsible for the esteemed brand founded by patriarch Thierry Herm\u00e8s in 1837. The Wertheimer brothers have been around luxury for a long time too. Their grandfather Pierre co-founded Chanel with Coco in 1924. But they are getting on in years \u2013 G\u00e9rard is 73 and runs the company\u2019s watch division and Alain is 75 and took the helm of the company in 1974. And they have varied interests, including French vineyards and a passion for thoroughbred horseracing. Apparently none of the brothers\u2019 children caught the bug for the Chanel business, so they have no one to pass their insider\u2019s knowledge along to but Nair. And her thirty years at Unilever plus two more at Chanel can\u2019t make up for a lifetime of learning that Dumas got around the dinner table. Unlike in horse racing, Dumas knows slow and steady wins the race in luxury and he manages the Herm\u00e8s brand accordingly. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

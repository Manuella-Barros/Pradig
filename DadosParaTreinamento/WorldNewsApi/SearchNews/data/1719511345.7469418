{"id": 223769500, "title": "Wigan Warriors ease home amid Salford Red Devils controversy", "text": "Matt Peet praised Junior Nsemba as the teenage forward gave another blistering display for champions Wigan. The towering 19-year-old scored only his second Super League try after thundering into Salford's Marc Sneyd and charging over from 20m during a first-half purple patch. Warriors raced into an 18-0 lead after just 23 minutes and never looked back with second-row Nsemba yet again showing his class. Peet said: \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of the way he\u2019s conducted himself, just his attitude to improve and concentrate on his performances and practice. \u201cHe\u2019s very driven. But he\u2019s always been the same. He\u2019s very diligent and asks good questions. He\u2019s always been great and you can tell he\u2019s been brought up well. He\u2019s a pleasure to coach and obviously has got some talent. It was a pleasing win.\u201d Even without banned forwards Kaide Ellis, Sam Walters and Liam Byrne, Wigan were too good, Adam Keighran and Brad O\u2019Neill also scoring in that early blitz. They moved up to second, sharing top spot with leaders St Helens and third-placed Warrington. But there was controversy along the way. Sneyd got treatment on an ankle injury in the 21st minute before being shown a green card. That meant the England scrum-half had to spend two minutes off the field and O\u2019Neill scored when Salford were down to 12 men. But Sneyd was fuming, arguing he\u2019d been stamped on but also that he\u2019d never asked for the game to be stopped so shouldn\u2019t have been made to leave the field. There was confusion on the sidelines but Salford boss Paul Rowley insisted: \u201cWe weren\u2019t confused. We knew the rules. It wasn\u2019t a green card. I think they realised it was wrong. No doctor came on. We didn\u2019t ask for the game to be stopped. \u201cSneydy did get stamped on but I\u2019ve seen the replay and I don\u2019t think it was intentional. But we\u2019ve already been punished with him being off for two minutes. I thought there were some harsh calls but it\u2019s not the reason we lost. \u201cWe had 25 minutes where we didn\u2019t respect possession, gave them too many opportunities and were 18-0 down. Wigan are a champion side.\u201d Salford\u2019s Nene Macdonald had an effort chalked off before ex-Wigan forward Oliver Partington did crash over in the 46th minute. Sneyd improved but Wigan never looked truly troubled. Keighran added a 64th-minute penalty before Bevan French arced over in the closing stages, Keighran adding his fifth goal.", "summary": "Towering 19-year-old Junior Nsemba scored only his second Super League try after thundering into Salford's Marc Sneyd and charging over from 20m during a first-half purple patch", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/wigan-warriors-salford-red-devils-32896999", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896824.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Salford-Red-Devils-v-Wigan-Warriors-Betfred-Super-League-Salford-Community-Stadium.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:56:39", "author": "David Craven,David-craven", "authors": ["David Craven", "David-craven"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.083}

On Saturday, his son, receiver Dimitri Stanley, signed after a successful tryout at the team's rookie camp, Packer Central has learned.\n\nStanley spent his first four seasons at Colorado before transferring to Iowa State for his final two years. All told, he caught 118 passes for 1,379 yards and five touchdowns. Last season, he caught 15 passes for 139 yards in 12 games.\n\nThe Packers had a full roster entering the weekend, so corresponding roster moves will have to be made. With 11 draft picks added to a talented roster, what would it take to get noticed among the 18-strong contingent of tryout players?\n\n\"We had one guy who had a one-handed grab out there that was pretty impressive,\" coach Matt LaFleur said after Friday's practice.\n\nThat player was Stanley, who also signed receiver Julian Hicks and lineman Lecitus Smith.\n\nAt pro day, Stanley measured 5-foot-10 7/8 and 188 pounds and ran his 40 in 4.52 seconds.\n\nWalter Stanley averaged 12.8 yards per punt return as a rookie, had an 83-yard touchdown return in 1986 and led the NFL in punt-return average with the Lions in 1989. Dimitri Stanley has some experience as a punt returner, too. He averaged 8.7 yards per punt return for his career, though most of his opportunities came while at Colorado.\n\n\"A lot of people don't really have the will to do it because you can't really see the people in front of you when that ball is in the air,\" Stanley told The DNVR in 2021. \"I just stay calm and trust my athleticism. ... I just grew up loving punt return. It's just explosive plays. It flips the field. It's everything that you want in a game; that excitement.\"\n\nWalter Stanley also played at Colorado, He piled up more than 3,200 return yards during his career.\n\n\"(My dad) is on the screen in the locker room that shows NFL Buffs so whenever I see him on there, it kind of gives me motivation,\" Dimitri said in 2019. \"It reminds me of what he accomplished and also gives me a feeling of where I can go. I grew up watching my dad's tape, learning elbows tucked, how to field the ball. So it comes natural for me, but I still have a long way to go.\"\n\nStanley considered hanging up his cleats after the Cyclones went 4-8 in 2022 - a fifth consecutive losing season for his teams. While his numbers weren't great, ISU went 7-6.\n\n\"I feel like I owed it to these guys to come in here and give them some good play from me, honestly,\" he said. \"But definitely help myself out as well, because I do still have those dreams of going to the next level.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_huber@si.com", "name": "Bill Huber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Stanley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walter Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LaFleur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt LaFleur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4268,h_2400,x_0,y_213/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx370qzca784yekt8r", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544026", "eventUri": "eng-9544026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

My wife's sitting next to me and I turned around and showed her the picture and she read the caption. And, of course, she immediately started bawling.\n\n\"Everyone in the suite's looking at her and wondering, 'What's going on? What is going on?' So, it was very emotional. It was very emotional for both of us because we know how hard he's worked. We also know how good he is.\"\n\nDimitri Stanley was one of three players who signed with the Packers following tryouts at the team's rookie minicamp. It was the culmination of a college career filled with promise, expectations and disappointment.\n\nAfter four seasons and with a fourth head coach on the horizon, Stanley transferred from Colorado - where his father started his collegiate career - to Iowa State in 2022. He caught 33 passes for 420 yards during his debut season. But, with his chance to solidify an opportunity in the NFL, he caught only 15 passes for 139 yards in 2023. Even while getting regular playing time, he wasn't even targeted in six of 12 games.\n\n\"He had probably one of the worst experiences I've ever seen any kid that I've been around his last year of college and what he had to deal with in terms of just not getting the ball but being on the field and being called on to just go down and block and run decoy routes, clear-out routes, and know that that ball was always going to go to someone else, even if he was open,\" Walter said.\n\n\"That's tough for an athlete. That is extremely tough. And for him to deal with that and take it on the chin and work through it and stay positive with his teammates and just keep pushing and working has been amazing.\"\n\nOf course, the lack of production torpedoed his NFL Draft chances. While Walter was a fourth-round pick by the Packers in 1985, Dimitri wasn't drafted and wasn't signed as a priority free agent. His opportunity - what might have been a make-or-break opportunity - came as one of 18 tryout players at the Packers' rookie camp.\n\nA one-handed catch grabbed coach Matt LaFleur's attention on Friday and he was signed on Saturday.\n\n\"I thought this was well-deserved for him, something that he had worked his tail off for,\" Walter said. \"The icing on the cake was it being the Green Bay Packers. Of course, in my home, we are all green and yellow. We're Packers through and through, and to connect with the team that was a childhood dream team has just been phenomenal.\n\n\"It's been a phenomenal feeling for him, phenomenal feeling for the family, phenomenal feeling for my extended family, as well, because they know that that's kind of where my journey started. To have your kid's journey start in the same place is just amazing.\"\n\nGetting an opportunity on the Packers' 90-man roster came after not getting many of them at Iowa State, even though he caught 15-of-16 targeted passes in 2023. He wasn't a factor as a punt returner, either.\n\nThe latter was one of Walter Stanley's calling cards. With the Packers, he averaged 12.8 yards per return as a rookie, had an electric 83-yard touchdown at Detroit on Thanksgiving in 1986 and led the NFL with a 13.8-yard average with the Lions in 1989. Dimitri Stanley averaged 12.3 yards per punt return during his final season at Colorado in 2021 but had just two returns in two seasons at Iowa State. On one of them, Walter said, only a shoestring tackle kept him from going the distance.\n\n\"The thing is, he's probably just as good, maybe even a little bit better, than I am,\" Walter said. \"Every time he touched the ball, it was lights out. He was almost taking every punt to the house. He just didn't get a chance to do it. He's really dangerous back there. ...\n\n\"I don't say that just because he's my kid. He'll tell you (that) I've always been honest with him and spoke the truth about what I see, what he's really good at and things that he may not be as good at. One thing I will say, he's a really, really good punt returner. I'm talking about he'd be one of the best punt returners out there. He makes things happen.\"\n\nIf Dimitri Stanley can make things happen as a punt returner during the offseason practices, training camp and preseason, he'll have a legitimate shot to join the Packers' young, talented and deep receiver corps. It's a group so strong that they didn't draft a receiver and didn't sign one after the draft. The lone additions are Stanley and Julian Hicks, another one of the tryout players.\n\nBut at least he's got a chance.\n\n\"It's going to be like being home. That's home for me,\" Walter said. \"Outside of high school, that's where football started for me. It's like coming home. And not only home, it's like living a dream.\"\n\nNo doubt Dimitri Stanley would have pounced on any opportunity. For it come with the Packers, though, makes it all the sweeter. He endured the outside expectations that come with being the son of an NFL player. The disappointment of playing for four losing teams in six collegiate seasons. Of never quite being that star player he envisioned.\n\nNone of it matters now. He's earned his shot.\n\n\"Just to have that opportunity for him is going to be exciting,\" Walter said. \"He loves the Packers. My daughter pulled out a letter last night that he had written when he was in fourth grade. And in fourth grade, he said he wanted to follow in his dad's footsteps.\n\n\"And, of course, he says I want to play for all the teams that my dad played for. And, of course, the Green Bay Packers are one of those teams that he said in that letter. So, he manifested this from fourth grade that the Packers was going to be a team of his that he played on. And for that to actually happen, and to also be the very first opportunity that came his way on a professional level, it's just an amazing story. It's phenomenal.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_huber@si.com", "name": "Bill Huber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2800,h_1575,x_0,y_403/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx703gtj70nrnh2cw7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544026", "eventUri": "eng-9544026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Dimitri Stanley caught 118 passes for 1,379 yards and five touchdowns in six seasons, four at Colorado (2018-'21) and two at Iowa State ('22-'23).\n\nHe also returned 30 punts for 260 yards (8.7 average), 28 at Colorado.\n\nAt his pro day, Stanley ran the 40-yard dash in 4.55 seconds, reached 34 inches on the vertical jump and 10-feet-8 inches on the broad jump and performed 17 reps on the bench press. His arms measured 32 inches and his hands 9 \u00bd inches.\n\nStanley stood out in Friday's minicamp practice, catching everything that was thrown to him and making a one-handed catch that coach Matt LaFleur commented on to reporters after the practice.\n\nStanley's father amassed 3,402 all-purpose yards in 48 games played and is remembered most for a three-touchdown game - including an electric 83-yard punt return - in a Thanksgiving Day victory over Detroit in '86.\n\nThe 6-2, 201-pound Hicks started out at Central Michigan, transferred to Akron in 2019 and then transferred to Albany in 2021. He sat out the '21 season with an injury, but in his two seasons with the Great Danes he caught 74 passes for 1,165 yards and 17 touchdowns, helping lead Albany to the FCS national semifinals his final season.\n\nIn his two seasons at Central Michigan and Akron, he caught 48 passes for 538 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nAt his pro day, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.55 seconds and measured a vertical jump of 36 \u00bd inches and a broad jump of 10-foot-6. His arms measured 31\u00be inches and his hands 9 5/8 inches.\n\nIn addition to the two receivers, the Packers also signed tryout guard, Lecitus Smith, according to Packer Central. The 6-3, 310-pound Smith was a sixth-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals in 2022 and played 10 games with two starts in his only year on a 53-man roster.\n\nThe Packers will have to release three

Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAn undrafted free agent out of Albany, Hicks caught 72 passes for 1,139 yards and 17 scores over the last two seasons. In back-to-back games against New Hampshire and Rhode Island in 2023, he caught 11 passes for 350 yards and two touchdowns. He previously played for Central Michigan and Akron. At 6-2 and over 200 pounds, Hicks has an impressive athletic profile that fits what the Packers look for at wide receiver. His 10-yard split and three-cone drill time were especially impressive. He was Dane Brugler's No. 107 ranked wide receiver in the draft class.\n\nSigned: OL Lecitus Smith\n\nDec 18, 2022; Denver, Colorado, USA; Arizona Cardinals guard Lecitus Smith (54) reacts on the sidelines in the fourth quarter against the Denver Broncos at Empower Field at Mile High. Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSmith was a sixth-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals in the 2022 draft who played in 10 games as a rookie (two starts) and also spent time on the practice squads of the Philadelphia Eagles and Houston Texans. The 25-year-old measures 6-3 and 314 pounds. For the Cardinals in 2022, he gave up 10 pressures and committed two penalties over 202 snaps, all at right guard. Smith has also played 218 preseason snaps over the last two seasons (gave up eight pressures, committed two penalties) while playing snaps at guard and center. Consider him interior depth.\n\nSigned: WR Dimitri Stanley\n\nOct. 29, 2022; Ames, Iowa, USA; Iowa State wide receiver Dimitri Stanley (14) runs the ball as he is chased by Oklahoma defensive back Jaden Davis in the fourth quarter at Jack Trice Stadium.

The Colorado transfer caught 118 passes for 1,379 yards and five touchdowns across six collegiate seasons at the two schools. The Packers list him at 6-0 and 200 pounds.

Johnson was signed to a futures deal in January. He participated during the minicamp over the weekend.\n\nWaived/injured: WR Thyrick Pitts\n\nDelaware's Thyrick Pitts catches a pass before going out of bounds during an FCS playoff game against South Dakota State on December 3, 2022, at Dana J.

Signing two wide receivers following the minicamp likely meant a cut at receiver was necessary. The position is in good shape, and now the Packers have two more young guys to see during the rest of the offseason workout program.

The Packers have nine cornerbacks on the roster, including seventh-round pick Kalen King and recent addition Gemon Green.\n\nDeandre Johnson, unlike another first-year defensive end, Deslin Alexandre, had a quiet rookie camp. The Packers have nine defensive ends of the roster, none of whom were added in this year's draft or college free agency.\n\nPitts was present for the rookie camp but rehabbing an injury. The Packers have 11 receivers on the roster, including Stanley - the son of former Packers receiver Walter Stanley - and Hicks along with former quarterback Alex McGough.\n\n\"It's just good to get them in the building to start to form a relationship with these guys and find out what they're all about and try to push them to be their best,\" coach Matt LaFleur said on Friday. \"You want to see everything they do, from the meeting room to on the field and how they compete. I think that's huge for us.\n\n\"I think in my time here, Gutey and his crew do such a great job of bringing in high-character, especially high-football-character individuals, guys that truly love the game, that want to be great. And that makes our job a hell of a lot easier and it makes it a lot more fun, too, when you're working with guys that want to put in the work, that are willing to do all the little things that it takes in order to be their best. So, it's great to get the guys in the building, get them acclimated and start to get to know them.\"\n\nThe Packers' veterans are continuing their offseason workouts this week.

Along with adding Dimitri Stanley to the roster, the Packers signed former Central Michigan wide receiver Julian Hicks and former Virginia Tech offensive lineman Lecitus Smith.\n\nDimitri Stanley joins the Packers after having a solid career at Iowa State. In two seasons with the Cyclones, Stanley caught 48 passes for 559 yards and a touchdown in 23 games with nine starts. He began his college career with the Colorado Buffaloes and registered 70 receptions for 820 yards and four touchdowns. He was selected to SB Nation's All-Pac 12 Freshman Team in 2019 after tallying 29 catches for 312 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nWalter Stanley is hoping that everything works out for his son. While speaking with Sports Illustrated, the former Packers wide receiver said the younger Stanley earned a spot on the roster.\n\n\"I thought this was well-deserved for him, something that he had worked his tail off for,\" Walter said. \"The icing on the cake was it being the Green Bay Packers. Of course, in my home, we are all green and yellow. We're Packers through and through, and to connect with the team that was a childhood dream team has just been phenomenal.\n\n\"It's been a phenomenal feeling for him, phenomenal feeling for the family, phenomenal feeling for my extended family, as well, because they know that that's kind of where my journey started. Having your kid's journey start in the same place is amazing.\"\n\nWalter also talked about Dimitri not getting the ball a lot in college. \"He had probably one of the worst experiences I've ever seen any kid that I've been around his last year of college and what he had to deal with in terms of just not getting the ball but being on the field and being called on to just go down and block and run decoy routes, clear-out routes, and know that that ball was always going to go to someone else, even if he was open,\" Walter said.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_jones@on3.com", "name": "Brian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Michigan_Chippewas_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Michigan Chippewas football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/06161512/Dimitri-Stanley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544026", "eventUri": "eng-9544026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 452726562, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 9, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 9}}}

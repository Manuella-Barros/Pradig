None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nMore from this section\n\nSimone Biles headlines a U.S. women's gymnastics team eyeing redemption at the Paris Olympics\n\nCharles Symington is the New President of Primum Familiae Vini\n\nCenterpoint Appoints Galen Baggs as New Chief Operating Officer", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "bill_barrow@kulr8.com", "name": "Bill Barrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.", "source": {"uri": "ctpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_barrow@ctpost.com", "name": "Bill Barrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw - and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They\u00b4ve fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president - himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter, left, and Gerald Ford, right, shake hands before the third presidential debate, Oct. 22, 1976, in Williamsburg, Va. (AP Photo/File)\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism - standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush\u00b4s talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter\u00b4s popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I\u00b4ll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter\u00b4s weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew\u00b4s resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill\u00b4s center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government\u00b4s expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u00b4s New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the \u00b476 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam - and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy - whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year - joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago - also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor\u00b4s race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nPresident Joe Biden talks on the phone as he walks to board Air Force One at McGuire Air Force Base, Saturday, June 29, 2024, in Burlington County, N.J.

From left, Natalie Biden, Biden, Finnegan Biden, and first lady Jill Biden.\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- There's plenty of worry among Democrats about whether 81-year-old President Joe Biden is up to the job itself or the task of defeating Donald Trump.\n\nPrevious presidential campaigns offer lessons. None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "bill_barrow@eagletribune.com", "name": "Bill Barrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates\n\nThat old age question (again)\n\nGaffes galore\n\nGetting personal\n\nBlunders without words\n\nBiden-Trump redux\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "bill_barrow@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Bill Barrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nFlorence's Red Bone Alley changes hands Florence's Seminar brewing sold to Victor's, Notch 8 owners Friday Pamplico crash claims life of car's driver Florence woman dies in Thursday afternoon Gilbert Drive fire Former Sonoco president, civic leader Charles Coker dies One person dies, other injured in 'accidental' shooting Shemar Simes back to slugging ways for Florence Post 1 American Airline adds another flight to Florence Two arrested, charged in Howe Springs fatal hit-and-un Lancaster man charged in Sunday Florence shooting Post 1 wins again, but issues with walks & strikeouts remain Darlington free clinic honors four of its founders Victory Sports Camp approaching 15 years of service in Mullins Flying umbrella impales woman visiting beach with her family, officials say Tuten, staff pushing right buttons for Flamingos thus far\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Getting personal Blunders without words Biden-Trump redux\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNorth Platte School Board continues debate on teacher dress code Man taken into custody near Brady after pursuit, manhunt Saturday More businesses inevitable on road to Maloney, Planning Commission tells boat-shop foes Kayaker says Nebraska a 'water wonderland' filled with hidden gems Retired Paxton village clerk pursues her 'passion' with City Bakery Missouri church announcement called for young men to form local militia.

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates\n\nThat old age question (again)\n\nGaffes galore\n\nGetting personal\n\nBlunders without words\n\nBiden-Trump redux\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats.

President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets.

Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party.

Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat.

Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Getting personal Blunders without words Biden-Trump redux Gaffes galore\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Getting personal Blunders without words Biden-Trump redux\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats.

Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates Gaffes galore Getting personal Blunders without words Biden-Trump redux\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Getting personal Blunders without words Biden-Trump redux\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Getting personal Blunders without words\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOkoboji lakes remain at near record levels; water activities still curtailed as July 4 holiday nears Panel looks to release more water from Okoboji lakes without hurting flood-stricken Spencer, Cherokee Sergeant Bluff-Luton assistant principal, AD resigns days after being placed on administrative leave Where to go for firework displays in Siouxland McCook Lake faces questions of flood recovery, future mitigation Dairy plant sues Sanborn over loss of $4 million in cheese What to know before you go to Saturday in the Park 2024 Siouxland homes without flood insurance face coverage limits and costly repairs after flooding McCook Lake residents voice their flooding concerns to Sen.

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat.

Previous presidential campaigns offer lessons. None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell. \"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses. Against Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nRamsay's Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay is worse than bad.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Getting personal Biden-Trump redux Blunders without words\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Getting personal Blunders without words Biden-Trump redux\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Biden-Trump redux Getting personal Blunders without words\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nRise in drivers behaving badly across metro Tucson grabs police attention Iconic Tucson bar expanding to Phoenix 35 fun events happening in Tucson this weekend June 27-30 \ud83c\udf9e\ud83d\udc10 Don't sleep on the carne asada from The Quesadillas, which might be one of Tucson's best-kept secrets A rare classic car museum is expanding at a new Tucson location Arizona, Tucson actions on homeless may follow Supreme Court ruling Arizona firm named in Justice Department's $2.7B health care fraud crackdown Monsoon is here! 9 Tucson restaurants and bars to watch the weather Take your pick from these Tucson-area Fourth of July fireworks shows Where to watch fireworks in Tucson this Fourth of July 34 fun events happening in Tucson this weekend ESPN projects four Arizona Wildcats to be taken in 2025 NBA Draft Guiding a modern-day basketball 'Dream Team,' Steve Kerr aims to avoid a nightmare at Paris Olympics Miami Heat pick up two Arizona Wildcats: Pelle Larsson, drafted No. 44, and undrafted Keshad Johnson Tucson police: Siblings dead in apparent murder-suicide\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush and the 'culture war' of 1992\n\nAn Ivy League-educated Episcopalian, Bush was a moderate Republican and never a favorite of the Christian right or anti-tax, small-government activists.\n\nBush appealed to the right flank ahead of his victory in 1988, saying, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" He was riding high in 1990 after a quick U.S. military victory drove Iraq and Saddam Hussein from oil-rich Kuwait. Within months, though, Bush broke his tax pledge, the U.S. economy began to falter (albeit mildly in retrospect), and the president grew vulnerable.\n\nPrimary challengers emerged, notably Steve Forbes, an anti-tax crusader, and commentator Pat Buchanan, a Christian conservative. Bush won every primary but many by unimpressive margins. Buchanan, rather than endorsing Bush enthusiastically, used his GOP convention speech to enlist religious conservatives in a \"culture war\" against Clinton, liberals and secularism -- standard Republican rhetoric today but a more divisive tone alongside Bush's talk of a \"kinder, gentler\" nation.\n\nDemocratic challenger and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton hammered Bush as out of touch with middle-class Americans. And billionaire Ross Perot entered the contest as an independent.\n\nOn Election Day, 62.6% of voters opted against Bush. Clinton won 370 electoral votes, the second-highest total for any Democrat since 1964.\n\nJimmy Carter and the Kennedy 'dream' in 1980\n\nA former Georgia governor, Carter was a moderate Southerner from outside the liberal Democratic power structure. His 1976 nomination and eventual victory over the Republican incumbent Ford was less about ideology, though, and more about Carter's promise never to lie to Americans disillusioned after Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.\n\nLegislative successes followed, but Carter rankled Washington Democrats. Global inflation, U.S. unemployment and interest rates climbed, and Carter's popularity fell.\n\n\"Carter was never expected and accepted by the establishment,\" said Joe Trippi, a 1980 Kennedy campaign staffer.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy mounted a primary challenge in 1980, inspiring young progressives like those who had once adored his slain older brothers. Carter famously said of Kennedy, \"I'll kick his ass.\" The president won enough delegates for the nomination, even as the Iran hostage crisis compounded his problems.\n\nYet in defeat, Kennedy used his convention speech more to rouse his own supporters rather than reconcile with the incumbent. \"The work goes on, the cause endures ... and the dream shall never die,\" Kennedy declared, exposing Carter's weaknesses.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAgainst Republican Ronald Reagan, Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C.\n\nGerald Ford and the budding Reagan revolution in 1976\n\nReagan won two general election landslides, but the foundation was his 1976 primary challenge against Ford.\n\nA mild-mannered Michigander, Ford had a unique path to the White House. President Richard Nixon elevated him from House leadership to the vice presidency in 1973 after corruption forced Spiro Agnew's resignation. Ford ascended to the presidency a year later when Nixon resigned because of Watergate.\n\nControversially, Ford pardoned Nixon. He faced inflation, high unemployment and roiled energy markets. And he had to prepare quickly to seek his own election, never having been part of a national campaign.\n\nFord hailed from Capitol Hill's center-right, a Republican cohort that mostly accepted the federal government's expanded scope since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Reagan, meanwhile, was corralling conservatives who never embraced FDR's America and blanched at the Civil Rights Movement and social revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the '76 primaries, Ford won 27 contests to Reagan's 24. That gave the incumbent 1,121 delegates, just 43 more than the insurgent challenger. Reagan had dominated most primaries in the South, the most conservative region of the country.\n\nIn the fall campaign, a wounded Ford made a late comeback against Carter but fell short. Carter carried the South. And Reagan was positioned to take the Republican mantle four years later.\n\nWhen a president did step aside: LBJ and 1968\n\nFord, Carter and Bush are not perfect parallels for 2024: Biden did not draw a credible primary challenge and, even with the debate fallout, he has a well of personal goodwill across his party. Perhaps the best comparison, then, is Johnson.\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy thrust Johnson into the Oval Office in November 1963. Known as LBJ, the colorful Texan trounced Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. Johnson amassed the most sweeping legislative record since FDR: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid. But Johnson vastly expanded U.S. involvement in Vietnam -- and lied to the country in the process. He also found himself unable to shepherd Americans through social changes of the era.\n\nPresidential campaigns were shorter then, so it was not until March 31, 1968, that Johnson mulled his sagging standing and announced his intentions. After weak showings in early primaries, which were not then binding affairs, Johnson said in an Oval Office address, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nWhat followed, though, is not necessarily encouraging for Democrats hoping to hear the same from Biden.\n\nNew York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is mounting an independent presidential bid this year -- joined a spirited Democratic nominating fight and secured momentum by winning the California primary in June. But he was assassinated in Los Angeles minutes after his victory speech.\n\nDemocrats were left with a raucous convention in Chicago -- also the site of the 2024 convention. They chose Vice President Hubert Humphrey to take on Nixon, the Republican former vice president who had lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960 and then dropped the 1962 California governor's race.\n\nNeither Nixon nor Humphrey were broadly popular, and the resulting general election was close, with independent George Wallace a key factor. Nixon outpaced Humphrey by about 500,000 votes out of 73 million cast, and he secured 301 electoral votes.\n\nSeven months after a beleaguered Democratic president stood down, his party met defeat. Republicans, with a president-elect who would one day resign in disgrace, had their comeback story.\n\nLaugh (or cringe) at these history-making moments from presidential debates That old age question (again) Gaffes galore Getting personal Blunders without words Biden-Trump redux\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

None convey reasons for optimism.\n\nGoing back to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, several presidents eligible for reelection faced significant primary challenges or questions about whether they should run again. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford pushed forward and won their nominations, only to be defeated in November. Johnson opted to withdraw -- and Democrats lost anyway.\n\nBiden had no real primary fight. But his allies now acknowledge how poorly the president performed in his debate against Trump. They've fretted privately about Biden's ability to serve until he is 86, and, more immediately, whether he can keep the job by defeating the Republican former president -- himself a 78-year-old saddled with a felony conviction, other indictments and voter concerns over his values and temperament.\n\nThe warning from history is ominous: Incumbent presidents still working to consolidate and reassure their own party this late in a first term typically do not get a second.", "source": {"uri": "columbian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Columbian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

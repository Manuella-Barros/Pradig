But then An suffered a serious knee injury during the gold medal match of the Asian Games in October. She defeated her rival from China, Chen Yufei, in three games while essentially playing on one leg, and An paid a price for it.\n\nDue to lingering effects of the ligament injury, An wasn't the same player earlier this year that she had been last year.

Then against He, An looked in full control from the onset, and didn't trail again the rest of the match after going down 8-7 in the first game.\n\nShowing off every shot in her bag, An consistently had He on the move and finished off long rallies with well-placed winners. Even when He tried to fight back, the match hardly seemed in doubt.\n\nAn appeared destined for Olympic success when she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time and captured her maiden world title last summer. But then An suffered a serious knee injury during the gold medal match of the Asian Games in October. She defeated her rival from China, Chen Yufei, in three games while essentially playing on one leg, and An paid a price for it. Due to lingering effects of the ligament injury, An wasn't the same player earlier this year that she had been last year. As the Olympic Games approached, there were legitimate question marks surrounding An's health and form.\n\nAn thanked her trainers for not giving up on her even when An herself wanted to.\n\n\"Because of my injury, I was not in a good spot before the Olympics, but I had so much help along the way from so many people,\" An said. \"They are the reason that I couldn't afford to give up.\"\n\nAn looked rusty out of the gate in the group stage but she blamed her sloppy play on nerves and lack of recent competitive action. As the tournament progressed, An regained her form.\n\nHer knee might still not have been 100 percent, but she has perhaps been the best-conditioned player in the tournament. Even when she was pushed to three games against Akane Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals and Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in the semifinals, An never looked any worse for wear, while her opponents were bent over with hands on their knees.\n\nAn didn't need extra work in the final, and worked He into the ground before winning several long rallies.\n\nThere were moments during the competition when An showed hints of the pressure she was carrying, trying to end a long badminton drought for South Korea.\n\nIt had been 16 years since the country had last won an Olympic gold in badminton, and 28 years since its last medal in a singles event.\n\nFormer world No. 1 Bang Soo-hyun won the women's singles gold in 1996, four years after taking home silver. And with Bang providing commentary for Korean TV in the booth, An put on quite a show in her convincing victory.\n\nAfter the medal ceremony, An said some huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders with the victory.\n\n\"I can finally breathe now and get a good night's sleep,\" An said. \"The moment I won the match, all the things I'd gone through came flooding back to me.

Then against He, An looked in full control from the onset, and didn't trail again the rest of the match after going down 8-7 in the first game.\n\nShowing off every shot in her bag, An consistently had He on the move and finished off long rallies with well-placed winners. Even when He tried to fight back, the match hardly seemed in doubt.\n\nAn appeared destined for Olympic success when she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time and captured her maiden world title last summer. But then An suffered a serious knee injury during the gold medal match of the Asian Games in October. She defeated her rival from China, Chen Yufei, in three games while essentially playing on one leg, and An paid a price for it. Due to lingering effects of the ligament injury, An wasn't the same player earlier this year that she had been last year. As the Olympic Games approached, there were legitimate question marks surrounding An's health and form.\n\nAn looked rusty out of the gate in the group stage but she blamed her sloppy play on nerves and lack of recent competitive action. As the tournament progressed, An regained her form.\n\nHer knee might still not have been 100 percent, but she has perhaps been the best-conditioned player in the tournament. Even when she was pushed to three games against Akane Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals and Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in the semifinals, An never looked any worse for wear, while her opponents were bent over with hands on their knees.\n\nAn didn't need extra work in the final, and worked He into the ground before winning several long rallies.\n\nThere were moments during the competition when An showed hints of the pressure she was carrying, trying to end a long badminton drought for South Korea.\n\nIt had been 16 years since the country had last won an Olympic gold in badminton, and 28 years since its last medal in a singles event.\n\nFormer world No. 1 Bang Soo-hyun won the women's singles gold in 1996, four years after taking home silver. And with Bang providing commentary for Korean TV in the booth, An put on quite a show in her convincing victory.\n\nBefore departing for Paris on July 12, An told reporters she wanted to come home with a bottle of champagne in her hand to celebrate her achievement.

Korea Times photo by Shim Hyun-chul\n\nMoments after capturing her first Olympic gold medal in Paris on Monday, South Korean badminton player An Se-young hinted at retiring from the national team over its poor handling of her knee injury.\n\nAn defeated He Bingjiao of China 2-0 (21-13, 21-16) in the women's singles final at Porte de La Chapelle Arena in Paris. It came about 10 months after An tore a ligament in her right knee during the Asian Games women's singles final in China.\n\nThe 22-year-old returned to action about a month later in November but went through an up-and-down stretch leading up to the Paris Olympics. Then after winning the gold medal, An accused the national team staff of not taking her injury seriously at first.\n\n\"My injury was more serious than initially thought and would take a while to heal. But the national team took it lightly and I can't forget how disappointed I was with that,\" An said. \"From this moment on, I even think it'll be difficult for me to continue on with the national team.\"\n\nAn claimed that her personal trainer on the national team worked so hard to help An realize her Olympic dream while also trying not to ruffle feathers within the national team.\n\nAn said there was a misdiagnosis of her condition and she kept on playing despite pain.

Who is Korea's An Se-young?", "body": "Badminton player An Se-young triumphed over China's He Bingjiao to win a gold medal in the women's singles contest at the Paris Olympics Monday, winning the highest honor in her career and marking yet another success on the international stage.\n\nAn's first Olympic medal comes in her second Games -- and initiates her into an exclusive club of athletes with medals from every major international tournament at the age of 22.\n\nSince entering her first international competition at 13, An has seen a long streak of success at nearly every tournament, following in the footsteps of fellow Korean legend Bang Soo-hyun, the last women's singles Olympic medalist in 1996.\n\nFrom starting badminton as a young child to topping the podium at every major competition in the world, what career has An had and how successful has she been?\n\nTalent from a young age\n\nAn started badminton when she was a first grader thanks to her father who had played the sport as a hobby.\n\nShe played the sport all throughout grade school and was considered a top prospect even during her elementary years.\n\nAs a junior player, she won a gold medal in the mixed team event at the 2017 Badminton Asia Junior Championships and bronze in the same discipline at the 2017 BWF World Junior Championships.\n\nHer talent allowed her rise to bigger prominence in middle school, participating in the national squad selection contest in December 2017 at the age of 15 as the youngest player at the time.\n\nBut age was just a number, as she beat all seven opponents during the contest to secure a place in the senior national team as the first middle school student to join the squad.\n\nA tight schedule as a Team Korea member still required her to go through intense training that involved running miles and weight exercises every day, while giving up time with family and friends.\n\nBut that harsh time paid off later on the senior international stage, where she established herself as one of the best athletes in Korean sports history.\n\nEarly days of senior international career\n\nAn did not immediately see success on the senior stage, failing to medal at her first senior international tournament, the Osaka International Challenge in April 2018, and losing to China's Chen Yufei -- whom An faced multiple times in following international tournaments -- in the round of 32 singles at the Asian Games in August that year.\n\nShe then won her first senior international title at the 2018 Irish Open, which kicked off a streak of victories.\n\nAt the 2019 New Zealand Open, she beat 2012 Olympic gold medalist Li Xuerui of China in the final and went on to win more titles like the Canada Open, French Open and Korea Masters later in 2019, earning the 2019 Most Promising Player of the Year.\n\nMore titles\n\nAn was not able to compete in as many competitions in 2020 due to Covid-19 but still won a silver medal in the team event at the Asian Women's Team Championship.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics in 2021 served as a test of whether she could carry her performance in past tournaments to the biggest stage yet, but her quest failed after losing in the quarterfinals -- to Chen, again.\n\nBut An saw a turnaround in following tournaments in 2022, winning the Korea Open, Malaysia Masters and Australian Open -- all events on the BWF World Tour -- in addition to taking two bronze medals in the women's singles at the Asian Championships and World Championships.\n\nThose tournaments served as a tune-up ahead of 2023, when she made history by becoming the first Korean to win the women's singles event in the 2023 BWF World Championships.\n\nNot just the unprecedented title, but she won multiple titles on the BWF World Tour, claiming the women's singles No. 1 ranking on Aug. 1, 2023 ahead of the Hangzhou Asian Games in September.\n\nOn the back of a stellar run, she went into action at the Asiad and beat her rival Chen in the women's singles final, becoming the first Korean to win a gold in the discipline at the Asiad since Bang Soo-hyun in 1994.\n\nRoad to legend\n\nMonday's Olympic medal makes An's medal cabinet nearly as rich as the one with badminton legend Bang, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the first Korean to win gold in the women's singles at the Olympics.\n\nTwo more Olympic medals will allow An to surpass Bang, who won one gold and one silver at the Games and two medals apiece from the Asian Games and world championships.\n\nAn had already won two medals each from the Asiad and world championships, just like the legend, with years left in her career.\n\nBang herself also acknowledged An's potential after she won the Asian Games gold medal in 2023 and said the following: \"I hope An surpasses me, which will be good for the development of badminton.\"\n\nBY PAIK JI-HWAN [paik.jihwan@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It came about 10 months after An tore a ligament in her right knee during the Asian Games women's singles final in China.\n\nThe 22-year-old returned to action about a month later in November but went through an up-and-down stretch leading up to the Paris Olympics. Then after winning the gold medal, An accused the national team staff of not taking her injury seriously at first.\n\n\"My injury was more serious than initially thought and would take a while to heal. But the national team took it lightly and I can't forget how disappointed I was with that,\" An said. \"From this moment on, I even think it'll be difficult for me to continue on with the national team.\"\n\nAn claimed that her personal trainer on the national team worked so hard to help An realize her Olympic dream while also trying not to ruffle feathers within the national team.\n\nAn said there was a misdiagnosis of her condition and she kept on playing despite pain. Right after the Asian Games in October, the national team said An would only need two to five weeks of rehab.\n\nWhen An underwent further tests at the end of the year, the situation turned out to be far more serious -- to a point that An would have to play through pain in the Olympics.\n\nWhen asked if she was retiring from the national team, An demurred and said, \"I want to keep going for the good of badminton in Korea and for my own accomplishments, but I don't know what the national federation will do. As long as I can play badminton, I feel like I can endure any situation.\"\n\nNot being on the national team may mean not having a chance to compete at the next Olympics, but An said, \"It would be too heartless if they kept players from competing at the Olympics just because they're not on the national team.\"", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yonhap News Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yoo_jee_ho@en.yna.co.kr", "name": "Yoo Jee-ho", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porte_de_La_Chapelle_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porte de La Chapelle Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Se-young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "An Se-young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Bingjiao", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "He Bingjiao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://img2.yna.co.kr/photo/yna/YH/2024/08/05/PYH2024080522120001300_P4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789700", "eventUri": "eng-9789700", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

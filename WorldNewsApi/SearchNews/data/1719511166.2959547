Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock was participating in a discussion titled \u201cStormy times \u2013 how foreign policy ensures the security of our democracy\u201d as part of weekend of events to celebrate the adoption of Germany\u2019s constitution, known as the Basic Law, 75 years ago. Several demonstrators in the theatre began shouting at Baerbock, accusing the German government of one-sidedness in the war and demanding that Berlin halt arms deliveries to Israel. Some held banners reading \u201cStop the genocide.\u201d Baerbock responded calmly at first, saying Germany was working to ensure that both Israelis and Palestinians could live in peace. But she clearly grew frustrated as the tumult in the theatre increased. \u201cThere are no threats here!\u201d she shouted at one participant. One protester who identified herself as an \u201canti-Zionist Jew\u201d said that, when it came to the war, freedom of expression was being restricted in Germany. With Germany\u2019s help, she said, Gaza was being reduced to \u201crubble and ashes.\u201d At least eight participants were forced out of the venue by dpa\u2019s count. In some cases, there were scuffles and physical altercations with security staff. Baerbock asked security not to use any violence against the demonstrators. Meanwhile, large sections of the rest of the audience reacted to the protest with loud booing. \u2013IANS dan", "summary": "Berlin, May 26 (IANS/DPA) Pro-Palestinian demonstrators angry at the German government&#8217;s handling of Israel&#8217;s war in Gaza disrupted a citizens&#8217; forum featuring Germany&#8217;s foreign minister on Sunday.

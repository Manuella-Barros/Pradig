Now, the adopted pup named Alan is famous with millions of followers online reminding him daily how special he is to them all.The Strutts were living in Qatar when they first noticed Alan. This dog lived with his pack at a construction site near their home. One of the workers at the site looked after the family of dogs, but when it became too much for him, others and the Strutt family, stepped up to rescue the dogs.Alan's owner Dan Strutt spoke to Newsweek and said it is not uncommon for strays to roam around the area. What made the situation uncommon was Alan's look since he was born with a crooked snoot and his bottom teeth stick out of his mouth when closed. All of Alan's family were \"a little bit wonky.\" However, the look didn't push the Strutts away. Instead, they welcomed Alan with open arms.The Strutts set up a TikTok account for Alan and users instantly fell in love with him. The account @alanthewonkydog currently has over 2.4 million followers. From the streets to stardom, Alan's life completely changed and he's enjoying every last bit of it now on an island off the coast of France.People will usually do a double-take when they see Alan, but they always greet him with kindness and say he's precious. Kids especially love coming up and asking questions about Alan.Strutt said people often wonder if Alan would need his nose straightened out, but the procedure could be dangerous. Plus, he's breathing fine and eats well.\"He definitely doesn't have a problem eating,\" Strutt joked.Strutt added that Alan loves all the attention and in return, he brings joy to people. Not to mention the pup has a children's book about him. But he still is the same dog they adopted from the streets of Qatar.\"He was the wonkiest and only got wonkier as he grew up,\" Strutt said.TikTok Viewers ReactA precious TikTok clip that was posted last month that asked users to rate Alan on a scale from one to 10 quickly amassed over 1.5 million views and 121,800 likes so far. One thing everyone could agree on about Alan was that he far exceeded the cuteness scale.\"1 million!! Handsome boy!!\" wrote one user, while a second added: \"100000000/10 all dogs are perfect.\"Another commented: \"He broke the scale. I would die for him, I would tbh I love dogs.\"One user wrote: \"10, he is unique just the way Allan is. Oh how imperfectly perfect he is.\"Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

The grocery landscape is rapidly changing with Wal-Mart, Costco and Amazon becoming the dominant and growing players. Over the last three years Wal-Mart, Costco and Amazon have all seen an expanding market share. At the same time period Kroger and Albertson have seen their share of the market decline. More and more consumers are gravitating to buying groceries online or in bulk. Kroger and Albertsons are innovating and investing to survive this changing marketplace. It's their consumers and workers who will benefit from more competitors and reduced costs. Kroger and Albertsons are union jobs-the others are not.\n\nAdditionally, and especially important for our community, Kroger has been an outspoken supporter of our nation's veterans. Over the last ten years, Kroger has hired over 50,000 veterans in-stores, technology and logistics. And committed over $41 million to the USO. They've also created the Veterans Associate Resource Group (ARG), which unites Kroger veterans and veteran supporters to highlight the talents and strengths of associates with military experience. As a veteran in a military-based community, this is noteworthy.\n\nIn my view, Kroger and Albertsons deserve a chance to merge and thus have a better ability to compete in this ever changing and competitive market.", "source": {"uri": "thesubtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Suburban Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertsons", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Albertsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Costco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://thesubtimes.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/TST-Featured-Image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543843", "eventUri": "eng-9543843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Looking at the information that has become public about the merger, 28 stores in Texas will be impacted while two Louisiana stores are.\n\nThe full map of the two companies' stores across the country can be seen below.\n\nTexas is Albertsons' second-biggest state in terms of number of stores: it clocks in with 44 Albertsons locations. Louisiana, meanwhile, has a handful of stores. Under the original agreement, Louisiana would see two stores sold and Texas would see 26 sold. All stores slated to be divested would be sold to C&S Wholesale Grocers.\n\nUnder the new plan, an additional two stores across both states would be sold.\n\nREAD MORE: Texas, Louisiana Grocers Selling More Stores as Merger Hits Snag\n\nAccording to the news outlet GroceryDive, the move does appear to be an attempt to head off the FTC's claims.\n\nWhile Kroger and Albertsons forcefully refuted the FTC's conclusion that the merger would hurt competitors, consumers and workers, the plan the grocers made public last week represents a clear declaration by the companies that they have heard and tried to address the agency's concerns, said Michael Infranco, assistant vice president of retail intelligence provider RetailStat.\n\n\"I think that's what the point of [the revised deal] was -- to at least be able to say, 'We've put together a standalone business and we've capitalized it to the point where we believe that this business will be able to compete on day one,'\" said Infranco.\n\nThe updated plan also includes \"increased distribution capacity, provisions for expanded transition services and an additional dairy facility.\"\n\nAll of which is a big deal, according to Infranco, who was quoted above.\n\n\"If you're going to spin off something that you had as part of your business, it has to be a viable business,\" he said. \"You have to include everything needed to stand alone. And I think adding some of these ancillary assets and services goes a bit of a way to doing that.\"\n\nBut the FTC will likely still strongly oppose the deal.\n\n\"This supermarket megamerger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years,\" said the director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, Henry Liu, about the original agreement. \"Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today.\"\n\nKroger responded to the FTC's challenge quickly at the time.\n\n\"Contrary to the FTC's statements, blocking Kroger's merger with Albertsons Companies will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America's consumers and workers,\" Kroger said in a statement on Monday. \"Kroger's business model is to take costs out of the business and invest in lowering prices for customers. Kroger has reduced prices every year since 2003, resulting in $5 billion invested to lower prices and a 5% reduction in gross margin over this period.\"\n\n\"This business model is immediately applied to merger companies,\" the company added. \"Kroger has a proven track record of lowering prices so more customers benefit from fresh, affordable food, and our proposed merger with Albertsons will mean even lower prices and more choices for America's consumers.\"\n\nThe FTC has made several moves to stop mergers in recent years, though with little success.

The retail media platform is powered by Kroger's first-party and purchase-based data.\n\nKroger ranks No. 6 in the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360's database of North America's leading retailers by online sales. Kroger is also first in the Top 1000's Food/Beverage category.\n\n\"Using first-party data is crucial to future-proof against third-party cookie deprecation, and applying Kroger's retail data will help to ensure addressability for our advertisers,\" said Elizabeth Herbst-Brady, chief revenue officer at Yahoo. \"This new offering not only reinforces our privacy-safe approach, but also demonstrates our commitment to interoperability and allows advertisers to activate high-quality data across campaigns through the Yahoo DSP.\"\n\nThe first-party consumer data that retail media networks use has gained interest as Google prepares for third-party cookie deprecation. The search giant plans to implement full deprecation on Chrome in early 2025. Other browsers have taken steps to block third-party cookies as well, limiting their utility in tracking users across different websites and activities.\n\nAccess to Kroger Precision Marketing, which the grocer operates with the retail media company 84.51\u00b0, will leverage Kroger's customer data. In addition, in cases where advertisers use both Kroger and Yahoo's platforms, they will be able to attribute store sales at Kroger locations based on media exposures from the Yahoo DSP.\n\n\"Advertisers on average see 6.5x higher return on ad spend when using our precision audiences,\" said Cara Pratt, senior vice president of Kroger Precision Marketing. \"By expanding our availability through the Yahoo DSP, we're delivering even more meaningful messages and measurable brand impact.\"\n\nThat impact is something that many other retailers are currently pursuing.

(WRDW/WAGT) - The new Kroger store is nearly ready to open near Jimmie Dyess Parkway and Gordon Highway.\n\nAt 8 a.m. May 22, the doors will open for business at Kroger's new Eisenhower Crossing Marketplace, 3942 Harper Franklin Ave.\n\nPrior to the store's official opening, Kroger will host a ribbon-cutting celebration at 7:30 a.m. with associates, customers, community leaders, Zero Hunger | Zero Waste partners and local Partners in Education.\n\nThe community is invited to the ribbon cutting and grand opening festivities.\n\nThe new store represents a $32 million investment and encompasses 124,000 square feet, with an adjacent fuel center, drive-thru pharmacy and a wide variety of popular features, including a Murray's Cheese Shop, expanded deli offerings, sushi and grocery pickup.\n\nKroger customers will be greeted with a vibrant mural designed by Augusta artist Karen Heid. According to Heid, the mural captures a sense of place and features many of Augusta's iconic landmarks.\n\nThe new store will be a Kroger Marketplace - which is a special kind of store.\n\nWhile the emphasis is still groceries at a Kroger Marketplace, they sell just about everything you could get at a Target that sells groceries. For example, they offer fashion and accessories that you can try on in a dressing room, small appliances, linens and towels, indoor and outdoor furniture, have a jewelry store and health clinic - and have been known to even stock bicycles.\n\n\"Kroger's new Eisenhower Crossing Marketplace reflects our commitment to the community,\" said Victor Smith, president of Kroger's Atlanta Division. \"We recognize Kroger's unique role in the communities we serve. As an employer, food processor, retailer, healthcare provider and more, we have a responsibility to create positive change and deliver on our purpose to feed the human spirit.\"", "source": {"uri": "wrdw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wrdw.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Highway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Highway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

But new genetic evidence points to the continent next door to Africa, researchers report August 7 in Royal Society Open Science.\n\nThe over 700 species of elapoid snakes are extremely diverse, including both highly venomous reptiles like mambas and sea snakes and many nonvenomous species. They're found in subtropical and tropical regions around the world, in rainforests, deserts and oceans. But the elapoids have long had a murky origin story, says Jeff Weinell, an evolutionary biologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City .\n\nEarlier genetic studies on the evolution of elapoids suggested an African origin for the group, and the oldest fossil elapoids dating back 25 million years -- including an early African file snake (Gonionotophis) -- come from Africa. More recent genetic studies have pointed toward Asia, says Weinell, but those and the Africa-leaning studies have used only a limited number of small sections of DNA.\n\n\"There just wasn't enough information in those sequences to really determine what the [evolutionary] relationships are among [these snakes],\" says Weinell.\n\nSo he and his colleagues sampled DNA from 65 snake species across 22 families, analyzing and comparing more than 3,100 locations in the snakes' genomes, or genetic instruction books. The team also included previously published genetic data from 434 more snake species. The researchers then built an elapoid evolutionary tree, showing how the species were related to each other and how long ago the lineages split apart. The more genetic markers two species share, the more recently they may have shared a common ancestor.\n\nTwo groups of Southeast Asian snakes -- mock vipers and cyclocorids -- were the earliest to diverge, suggesting that elapoids first arose in Asia. This is still consistent with the 25-million-year-old fossil evidence in Africa, Weinell says.\n\n\"We're showing an [elapoid] origin in Asia about 35 million years ago, and the group reaching Africa by around 30 million years ago,\" says Weinell. The researchers think elapoid snakes colonized Africa four different times. The ancestor of a group that diversified into many families across the continent may have arrived first, followed by the ancestors of African cobras, African garter snakes and mambas.\n\nLong-standing ideas like the \"out-of-Africa\" hypothesis of elapoid snake evolution are sometimes presumed to be accurate due to their longevity, says Justin Bernstein, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Texas at Arlington.\n\n\"However, this research refutes this hypothesis and changes what we know about the origins of one of the most species-rich groups of snakes, many of which are important species of study in evolutionary and medical research due to their venom,\" he says (SN: 9/19/20).", "source": {"uri": "sciencenews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sea snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cobra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamba", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mamba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Venom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taxonomic rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rainforest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reptile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Museum of Natural History"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Evolution", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Evolution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/080624_jb_snake-origins_feat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798216", "eventUri": "eng-9798216", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 405, "textEnd": 413}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

And this whiplash motion may have helped real-life cobras and their relatives spread from Asia, where they originated, to the rest of the world.\n\nScientists once believed that Elapoidea, the superfamily containing cobras, coral snakes and mambas, originated in Africa. A fossil of a file snake found in Tanzania and dated to the Oligocene Epoch (33.9 million to 23 million years ago) supported this hypothesis -- it is the oldest relative of this group discovered in the fossil record.\n\nBut in new research, published Aug. 7 in the journal Royal Society Open Science, researchers used genetic analysis and fossils from other regions to conclude that these snakes, as well as snakes in the related superfamily Colubroidea, actually originated in Asia.\n\n\"The reason for the uncertainty was mostly because of the lack of understanding of how these different species are related to one another,\" lead author Jeffrey Weinell, an evolutionary biologist and postdoctoral fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, who conducted the research while at the University of Kansas, told Live Science.\n\nRelated: 50-foot 'king of the serpents' may have been the biggest snake to ever live\n\nScientists had never compiled comprehensive genetic data on the group before, he explained. \"I was interested in inferring the tree of life for this group, which predicts the evolutionary relationships, and then using that tree of life estimate plus information about modern species to estimate where the ancestor of this group lived,\" he added.\n\nIn the new study, Weinell and colleagues analyzed 3,128 locations on the genomes of 65 species of Elapoidea to decipher how all the snakes were related. They also included additional data from 434 other species, some of which had already been compiled in genetic databases and some of which they sampled themselves.

There are now 700 species, on every continent except Antarctica and many islands as well. Even the seas have been colonized by these early snakes' descendants.\n\nThe study found these snakes had a convoluted evolutionary history. Elapoids and colubroids likely moved into Africa from Asia on at least 15 different occasions, for example. And they recolonized Asia from Africa at least seven times, indicating the complexity of their movement between landmasses and underscoring the difficulty of tracing their origins.\n\nAs to how they

Over 35 snakes were rescued during the Nag Panchami festival last year, highlighting the need for increased oversight and intervention to prevent potential harm to both the animals and residents.\n\nDivisional forest officer Mahendra Singh Solanki said, \"During Nag Panchami, snake charmers, known as \"saperas,\" often take to the streets, performing with snakes as part of the festival's rituals.\"\n\nHe added, this practice must be discouraged as it poses threat to both the snakes and the public.\n\n\"By closely monitoring the activities of snake charmers, the teams aim to ensure that the festival is celebrated responsibly, minimizing risks and promoting humane treatment of snakes,\" Solanki said.\n\nResidents are encouraged to report any concerns or sightings of snake charmers to the designated teams or local authorities to assist in their efforts.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_charming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Snake charming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_Panchami", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naga Panchami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendra_Solanki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahendra Solanki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Conferences_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Conferences and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08-08/cyj9g28m/New-Project-2024-08-07T141738.685.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798216", "eventUri": "eng-9798216", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 90, "textEnd": 95}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Hey, I get it. I can't stand snakes, and here I am writing this story.\n\nTrust me, if I ever encounter one, \"friendship\" won't be the first thing that comes to mind. But I do understand that most snakes actually ARE beneficial, and I also know that many snakes that do help us out--in terms of what their prey--are killed every year simply out of fear. Copperhead lookalikes are especially under the gun.\n\nKentucky's Largest Snake Species\n\nOne of those snakes that should be left well enough alone--because it will return the favor, by nature--is the gray rat snake. It is the largest species of snake found in Kentucky.\n\nAre Gray Rat Snakes Cause for Concern?\n\nSo, yes, if I saw that thing, it would make my blood run cold and I would freeze right where I was standing. And that's fine; gray rat snakes--like black rat snakes--are not aggressive and want nothing to do with us humans. We're not part of the diet; pests that cause real problems are. Farmers love that part.\n\nGray Rat Snakes Are Also Constrictors\n\nAlso, if you're concerned about the fact that they are constrictors, there's no need to be. They save the big squeeze for rodents and other creatures they like to snack on. Still, I wouldn't exactly take that guy's lead and just pick up a snake without knowing what kind you're dealing with. And THAT gray rat snake is actually a runt compared to how big they CAN get.\n\nAccording to the University of Kentucky, gray rat snakes--which can be found all over the Commonwealth--can grow to lengths greater than six feet. Humbling, to say the least.\n\nBy the way, gray rat snakes are also the largest snakes in Canada. (Forgive me for not realizing Canada even HAD snakes.) Just look at this bad boy.\n\nAgain, these are not an aggressive species, but don't corner one, either. All animals get irritated when you do that.

Its remote home and camouflage coloring likely helped it go unnoticed and, when occasionally encountered, be misidentified.\n\nBut the lurking animal turned out to be a new species.\n\nResearchers ventured into the mountainous forests of Mizoram state in 2021 to survey wildlife, according to a study published Aug. 7 in the peer-reviewed journal Diversity. During the nighttime expeditions, they found four olive green snakes.\n\nSoon after, a pair of \"reptile enthusiasts\" found a few more similar-looking snakes, the study co-authors said in a news release shared with McClatchy News.\n\nResearchers took a closer look at the snakes, analyzed their DNA and soon realized they'd discovered a new species: Smithophis mizoramensis, or the Mizo brook snake.\n\nMizo brook snakes can reach 2 feet in length, the study said. Their \"short\" heads have \"large, crescent-shaped\" nostrils and a \"blunt, rounded\" snout.\n\nA photo shows the olive green coloring of the new species. A brown stripe runs down its spine and \"indistinct\" brown bands mark its sides.\n\nMizo brook snakes are semi-aquatic, nocturnal reptiles typically found lurking under rocks or boulders near streams, researchers said. The snakes live in evergreen forests at elevations of about 2,300 feet and are \"mostly active during the monsoons.\"\n\nResearchers said they named the new species after Mizoram because it was discovered there and, so far, has only been found there. Mizoram is a state in eastern India, a roughly 1,600-mile drive southeast from New Delhi, that borders Myanmar to the east and Bangladesh to the south.\n\nThe new species' common name refers to its preferred habitat.\n\nMizo brook snakes were identified by their pattern, stomach coloring and other subtle physical features, the study said.

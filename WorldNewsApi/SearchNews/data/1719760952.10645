While much has changed since the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in 2015, the landmark ruling didn't solve everything, and there remain distinct financial and legal challenges facing many members of this community. It is imperative for the wealth management community to understand these challenges and develop ways to fully support and serve this growing segment. Growing in Numbers and Affluence According to a recent Gallup Poll, 7.1% of the US population now self-identifies as LGBTQ+, more than 20% for Gen Z. Furthermore, over the last five years, the size of the affluent segment (household income of $125,000+) in the LGBTQ+ community has increased by around 76%, compared to growth of about 50% in the general population. Getting Over The Rainbow - Representation and Visibility Building a reputation and gaining trust within any community needs to go well beyond the surface or, in this case, beyond the rainbow flag. A recent Merrill Lynch survey found that the three key areas where financial services companies can build trust within the LGBTQ+ community are: being welcoming and inclusive, hiring members of the community and demonstrating an understanding of the critical issues unique to the community. According to Rod Sayegh, a member of the LGBTQ+ community and Managing Director at Fiduciary Trust International, \"recruiting professionals from within the LGBTQ community can go a long way to build trust and connection as they bring unique perspectives and skillsets to an organization. Having representation across all areas of the company goes even further to ensure that commitment is truly firm-wide.\" Understanding the Unique Financial Needs of the LGBTQ+ Community While the wealth management framework is the same, some challenges and planning considerations within the LGBTQ+ community are unique.

It can involve significant up-front expenses\u2014with surrogacy, adoption, and in-vitro fertilization fees costing upwards of $100,000. This also impacts considerations around inheritance planning, with affluent LGBTQ+ individuals aged 20-34 stating that being able to leave an inheritance to family\u2014either biological or chosen\u2014is one of their most important financial goals. When it comes to retirement and estate planning, investors and wealth managers need to understand that the right for same-sex couples to marry doesn't solve everything financially. Current regulations regarding inheritance, tax, and healthcare can still vary by state and may not always favor LGBTQ+ individuals. A solid wealth plan ensures that assets are protected and distributed according to their wishes. A Keen Interest in Principles-Based Investing Nearly half of all US investors and 86% of LGBTQ+ investors say they are interested in more opportunities to invest in companies and vehicles that help minimize harm and enhance positive outcomes for the LGBTQ+ community while meeting other financial goals. Wealth managers can help meet this need by creating and promoting funds and investment vehicles specifically designed to advance LGBTQ+ equity. This includes ETFs, mutual funds, and impact investing opportunities focusing on companies with strong LGBTQ+ inclusion policies. Wealth managers can also look to organizations like the Human Rights Campaign to identify companies with high Corporate Equality Index scores and incorporate these into investment products. Wealth managers have a pivotal role in supporting the LGBTQ+ community by offering tailored financial advice, inclusive investment opportunities, and understanding the unique challenges faced by this group. By prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in their practices, wealth managers can not only meet the financial goals of LGBTQ+ clients but also foster a more inclusive and equitable financial landscape.

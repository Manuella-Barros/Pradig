It follows an earlier recall of more than 200,000 pounds of sliced deli poultry and meat. The new items include meat intended to be sliced at delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores.\n\nThey include liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products made at the firm's Jarratt, Virginia, plant.\n\nThe recalls are tied to an ongoing outbreak of listeria poisoning that has killed two people and sickened nearly three dozen in 13 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly all of those who fell ill have been hospitalized. Illnesses were reported between late May and mid-July.\n\nThe problem was discovered when a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. Further testing showed that the type of bacteria was the same strain causing illnesses in people.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to immediately and voluntarily expand our recall to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility,\" the company said on its website. It has also halted production of ready-to-eat foods at the plant.\n\nThe meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama, Agriculture Department officials said.\n\nConsumers who have the recalled products in their homes should not eat them and should discard them or return them to stores for a refund, company officials said. Health officials said refrigerators should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination of other foods.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.\n\nListeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food. The infections are especially dangerous for people older than 65, those with weakened immune systems and during pregnacy.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. health officials Friday (July 26, 2024) announced a recall of some Boar's Head liverwurst and deli meats as they investigate a listeria outbreak that has sickened nearly three dozen people and caused two deaths.\n\nBoar's Head Provisions Co. recalled liverwurst because it may be tainted with the listeria bacteria, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The agency said a sample of Boar's Head liverwurst from a Maryland store tested positive for listeria.\n\nThe company is also recalling deli-sliced meats made the same day on the same line as the contaminated liverwurst at a Virginia plant, the USDA said. The sample was from an unopened package, collected by health officials as part of an investigation into the listeria outbreak\n\nTesting is underway to determine if the liverwurst sample is connected to the outbreak, health officials said.\n\nThe company did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe listeria outbreak was first reported last week. Since late May, 34 people were sickened across 13 states, with all but one hospitalized. Two people died -- in Illinois and New Jersey. It can take weeks for symptoms to develop symptoms so there may be more cases, officials said.\n\nPeople most commonly reported eating deli-sliced turkey, liverwurst and ham, officials said.\n\nListeria can contaminate food and sicken people who eat it. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea. It can be treated with antibiotics, but it is especially dangerous to pregnant women, newborns, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Boar's Head recall of over 200,000 pounds shipped nationwide applies to meats sliced at a deli counter, not prepackaged meats. It includes a number of multi-pound packages stamped with an Aug. 10 sell-by date, including bologna, garlic bologna, beef bologna, beef salami, Italian Cappy-style ham and Extra Hot Italian Cappy-style ham. Also included is Steakhouse Roasted Bacon Heat and Eat, with a sell-by date of Aug. 15.\n\nConsumers who might still have the recalled meats shouldn't eat them, and officials said they should thoroughly clean their refrigerators to prevent contamination of other foods.", "source": {"uri": "drgnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DRGNews"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Authorities say further testing is required to determine whether any recalled products are linked to this outbreak.\n\nDetails of Boar's Head deli meat recall\n\nThe Virginia-based meat producer recalled approximately 207,528 pounds of products that were distributed to retail deli locations nationwide, including all liverwurst products and \"additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst\" that could be \"adulterated with L. monocytogenes.\"\n\nBoar's Head deli meat recalled product information\n\nThe newly added items \"include meat intended for slicing at retail delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold at retail locations,\" FSIS stated Wednesday. \"These products have 'sell by' dates ranging from 29-JUL-2024 through 17-OCT-24.\"\n\nClick here for the full list of product details with item numbers, brand names and sell by dates.\n\nThe ready-to-eat liverwurst products were produced between June 11, 2024, and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf life.\n\nRecalled liverwurst products include 3.5-pound loaves in plastic casing, or \"various weight packages sliced in retail delis,\" according to the FSIS, and are labeled \"Boar's Head Strassburger Brand Liverwurst MADE IN VIRGINIA.\"\n\nThe products, which the FSIS said were shipped to retailers, bear sell by dates ranging from July 25 to Aug. 30, 2024. Sell by dates are printed on the side of the packaging.\n\nClick here for images with full label details.\n\nAdditional ready-to-eat deli meats subject to recall\n\nThe recalled products bear establishment number \"EST. 12612\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\n\nThe above products were produced on June 27, 2024, according to Boar's Head.\n\nWhat prompted the Boar's Head recall\n\nAccording to the USDA, the problem was discovered when the FSIS \"was notified that a sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for L. monocytogenes.\"\n\n\"The Maryland Department of Health, in collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department, collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for testing as part of an outbreak investigation of L. monocytogenes infections,\" the agency stated. \"Further testing is ongoing to determine if the product sample is related to the outbreak. Anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.\"\n\nDetails of listeria outbreak linked to deli meats\n\nThe FSIS is currently working with the CDC as well as state public health partners to investigate a multi-state outbreak of listeria infections linked to meats sliced at delis, USDA officials said this week.\n\nAccording to the agency, as of July 25, \"34 sick people have been identified in 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths.\"\n\nAs of July 19, states involved in the outbreak included Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.\n\n\"Samples were collected from sick people from May 29, 2024, to July 12, 2024,\" the USDA stated this week, adding that \"the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nIn a notice published July 19, the CDC stated that many of those sickened in the outbreak had reported eating meat that they had sliced at deli counters.\n\n\"Investigators are collecting information to determine the specific products that may be contaminated,\" the CDC stated.\n\n\"Listeria spreads easily among deli equipment, surfaces, hands and food,\" the agency added. \"Refrigeration does not kill Listeria, but reheating to a high enough temperature before eating will kill any germs that may be on these meats.\"\n\nSymptoms, side effects of listeria\n\nAccording to the CDC, listeria can cause severe illness \"when the bacteria spread beyond the gut to other parts of the body\" after a person consumes contaminated food. Those at higher risk include pregnant people, those aged 65 or older, or anyone who has a weakened immune system, the CDC says.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, it can cause pregnancy loss, premature birth, or a life-threatening infection in your newborn,\" the CDC states on its website. \"Other people can be infected with Listeria, but they rarely become seriously ill.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, anyone infected with listeria may experience \"mild food poisoning symptoms\" such as diarrhea or fever, and many recover without antibiotic treatment.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The new items include meat intended to be sliced at delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores.\n\nThey include liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products made at the firm's Jarratt, Virginia, plant.\n\nThe recalls are tied to an ongoing outbreak of listeria poisoning that has killed two people and sickened nearly three dozen in 13 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly all of those who fell ill have been hospitalized. Illnesses were reported between late May and mid-July.\n\nThe problem was discovered when a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria.

It follows an earlier recall of more than 200,000 pounds of sliced deli poultry and meat. The new items include meat intended to be sliced at delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores.\n\nThey include liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products made at the firm's Jarratt, Virginia, plant.\n\nThe recalls are tied to an ongoing outbreak of listeria poisoning that has killed two people and sickened nearly three dozen in 13 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly all of those who fell ill have been hospitalized. Illnesses were reported between late May and mid-July.\n\nThe problem was discovered when a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. Further testing showed that the type of bacteria was the same strain causing illnesses in people.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to immediately and voluntarily expand our recall to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility,\" the company said on its website. It has also halted production of ready-to-eat foods at the plant.\n\nThe meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama, Agriculture Department officials said.\n\nConsumers who have the recalled products in their homes should not eat them and should discard them or return them to stores for a refund, company officials said. Health officials said refrigerators should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination of other foods.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.\n\nListeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food. The infections are especially dangerous for people older than 65, those with weakened immune systems and during pregnacy.\n\nDownload the FOX13 Memphis app to receive alerts from breaking news in your

It is recalling all items produced at its facility in Jarratt, Virginia, including many ham, bologna, bacon, frankfurter and sausage products.\n\n\"We have also decided to pause ready-to-eat operations at this facility until further notice,\" Boar's Head said in a statement. \"As a company that prioritizes safety and quality, we believe it is the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe move adds about 7 million pounds of products to the recall, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Tuesday, including meat from retail deli counters as well as packaged products with sell-by dates from July 29 through October 17.

Pregnant people may have pregnancy loss or premature birth.\n\nListeria can spread easily at delis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, transferring from equipment to surfaces to hands and food. Refrigeration does not kill the bacteria, but heat can.\n\nPeople who are pregnant, those who are 65 and older, and those with weakened immune systems are advised to avoid eating deli meat unless it's

officials, who may get in touch to find out what they ate in the past month and may ask for receipts or leftover food to help pinpoint the root of the outbreak.\n\nConsumers who have purchased recalled products should throw them out or return them to the place of purchase, as well as thoroughly cleaning refrigerators and other surfaces that may have come into contact with the meat.\n\nThose

It is recalling all items produced at its facility in Jarratt, Virginia, including many ham, bologna, bacon, frankfurter and sausage products.\n\n\"We have also decided to pause ready-to-eat operations at this facility until further notice,\" Boar's Head said in a statement. \"As a company that prioritizes safety and quality, we believe it is the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe move adds about 7 million pounds of products to the recall, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Tuesday, including meat from retail deli counters as well as packaged products with sell-by dates from July 29 through October 17.

Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross-contamination.\n\nFederal and state officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate a multistate outbreak of listeria monocytogenes infections that are linked to meats sliced at delis.\n\nAs of Tuesday, according to the FSIS, 34 sick people have been identified in 13 states. So far, there are no cases in Michigan, according to the CDC's map of states reporting infections.\n\nThere have been 33 hospitalizations and two deaths reported.\n\nThose sickened by the outbreak, according to the earlier recall, reported eating meats they had sliced at deli counters, the CDC says. The FSIS investigation is ongoing and they are working with the CDC and state officials.\n\nSymptoms of listeria infection\n\nThe CDC says symptoms of listeria infection can be different depending on the person and part of the body affected.\n\nHealthy individuals may experience high fever, severe headaches, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nSymptoms usually start two weeks after eating food contaminated with listeria. But they can also start as soon as the day of exposure and as late as 10 weeks after, the CDC says.\n\nPregnant women\n\nTypically, pregnant women experience fever, muscle aches and fatigue. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\n\nPregnant people usually have fever, muscle aches and tiredness.\n\nHigher-risk other than pregnant women\n\nSymptoms can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions in addition to fever and muscle aches.\n\nThose individuals who are 65 years and older or with have weakened immune systems are at higher risk because the listeria is more likely to spread beyond their gut to other parts of their body, resulting in a severe condition known as invasive listeriosis, the CDC says.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press food writer Susan Selasky and send food and restaurant news to: sselasky@freepress.com.

It follows an earlier recall of more than 200,000 pounds of sliced deli poultry and meat. The new items include meat intended to be sliced at delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey include liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products made at the firm's Jarratt, Virginia, plant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recalls are tied to an ongoing outbreak of listeria poisoning that has killed two people and sickened nearly three dozen in 13 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Further testing showed that the type of bacteria was the same strain causing illnesses in people.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to immediately and voluntarily expand our recall to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility,\" the company said on its website. It has also halted production of ready-to-eat foods at the plant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama, Agriculture Department officials said.\n\nConsumers who have the recalled products in their homes should not eat them and should discard them or return them to stores for a refund, company officials said. Health officials said refrigerators should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination of other foods.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food. The infections are especially dangerous for people older than 65, those with weakened immune systems and during pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreTwo North Dallas residents confirmed

So far, 34 cases in 13 states have been reported, with 33 of those patients winding up in the hospital and two dying, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"Listeria is especially harmful to people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or with weakened immune systems,\" the agency said in a news release. \"[The] CDC always recommends people at higher risk for listeriosis avoid eating meats sliced at the deli or heat them to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or until steaming hot before eating.\"\n\nThe expanded recall includes 71 products made between May 10 and July 29 under the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names. The newly recalled items include meat to be sliced at delis and some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores. Liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products are affected.\n\nLast Friday, Boar's Head first announced it was recalling all of its liverwurst products because they could be tainted with listeria.\n\n\"The company is also recalling additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst and, therefore, may be adulterated with L. monocytogenes,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said in a statement.\n\nOverall, Boar's Head \"is recalling approximately 207,528 pounds of products,\" FSIS noted at the time.\n\nThe listeria investigation was first announced July 22 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAt the time, the source or sources of the outbreak were unknown.\n\nAs FSIS explained, testing first performed in Maryland spotted a sample of Boar's Head liverwurst product contaminated with listeria.\n\nBesides the liverwurst products, some of other Boar's Head meats that have been included in the recall include certain lots of Virginia Ham/Old Fashioned Ham, Italian Cappy Style Ham, various types of Bologna, Beef Salami, among others.\n\n\"The ready-to-eat liverwurst products were produced between June 11, 2024, and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf life,\" FSIS noted. Products were shipped to retailers nationwide.\n\nIf consumers find they have any of the recalled products in their fridges, they should discard them or return them to the place of purchase.\n\n\"Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross-contamination,\" FSIS added.\n\nDeli owners who find they have the products \"should clean and sanitize all food and non-food surfaces and discard any open meats and cheeses in the deli,\" the agency added.\n\nListeria bacteria can cause listeriosis, the third-leading cause of death from food-borne illness in the United States. Symptoms typically include a fever, muscle aches and fatigue. Infection may also cause a headache, a stiff neck, confusion or seizures.

So far, 34 cases in 13 states have been reported, with 33 of those patients winding up in the hospital and two dying, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"Listeria is especially harmful to people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or with weakened immune systems,\" the agency said in a news release. \"[The] CDC always recommends people at higher risk for listeriosis avoid eating meats sliced at the deli or heat them to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or until steaming hot before eating.\"\n\nThe expanded recall includes 71 products made between May 10 and July 29 under the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names. The newly recalled items include meat to be sliced at delis and some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores. Liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products are affected.\n\nLast Friday, Boar's Head first announced it was recalling all of its liverwurst products because they could be tainted with listeria.\n\n\"The company is also recalling additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst and, therefore, may be adulterated with L. monocytogenes,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said in a statement.\n\nOverall, Boar's Head \"is recalling approximately 207,528 pounds of products,\" FSIS noted at the time.\n\nThe listeria investigation was first announced July 22 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAt the time, the source or sources of the outbreak were unknown.\n\nAs FSIS explained, testing first performed in Maryland spotted a sample of Boar's Head liverwurst product contaminated with listeria.\n\nBesides the liverwurst products, some of other Boar's Head meats that have been included in the recall include certain lots of Virginia Ham/Old Fashioned Ham, Italian Cappy Style Ham, various types of Bologna, Beef Salami, among others.\n\n\"The ready-to-eat liverwurst products were produced between June 11, 2024, and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf life,\" FSIS noted. Products were shipped to retailers nationwide.\n\nIf consumers find they have any of the recalled products in their fridges, they should discard them or return them to the place of purchase.\n\n\"Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross-contamination,\" FSIS added.\n\nDeli owners who find they have the products \"should clean and sanitize all food and non-food surfaces and discard any open meats and cheeses in the deli,\" the agency added.\n\nListeria bacteria can cause listeriosis, the third-leading cause of death from food-borne illness in the United States. Symptoms typically include a fever, muscle aches and fatigue. Infection may also cause a headache, a stiff neck, confusion or seizures. Pregnant women may experience pregnancy loss or premature birth.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), news release, July 30, 2024", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverwurst", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverwurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Listeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicatessen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delicatessen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lunch meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Safety_and_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food Safety and Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Listeria monocytogenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunodeficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeriosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Listeriosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_sausage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bologna sausage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Meat_and_Seafood", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Meat and Seafood", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Meat", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777013", "eventUri": "eng-9777013", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-05-10", "dateEnd": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 977}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1801, "textEnd": 1808}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-06-", "textStart": 2365, "textEnd": 2372}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 2384, "textEnd": 2391}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Donate today\n\nMajor U.S. deli supplier Boar's Head was expanding its recall of meat products to an additional 7 million pounds of goods, after one of the company's products was linked to a widespread listeria outbreak tied to sliced deli meats that has sickened more than a dozen New York and New Jersey residents.\n\nThe expansion includes 71 products -- packaged meat and poultry products sold at retail locations, as well as meats intended for deli slicing -- marketed under both the Boar's Head and Old Country brands, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The products were produced between May 10 and July 29, and have \"sell-by\" dates ranging from July 29 through Oct. 17.\n\nBoar's Head said it was pausing production of \"ready-to-eat\" products at its facility in Jarratt, Virginia, \"out of an abundance of caution\" and recommended that consumers throw away or return any of the recalled products. The company also said the USDA told it on Monday evening that its Strassburger Brand Liverwurst was connected to the listeria outbreak. A total 200,000 pounds of that product and nine others made on the same day and production line at the Jarratt facility were voluntarily recalled last Friday.\n\n\"On behalf of all of us at Boar's Head Brand, we want to let our customers and consumers know that we deeply regret that our liverwurst products were found to be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes,\" the Florida-based company said on its website. \"No words can fully express our sympathies and the sincere and deep hurt we feel for the families that have suffered losses and others who endured illness.\"\n\nAs of Friday, the outbreak had 34 confirmed cases of listeria illness across 13 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is investigating alongside other public health agencies. Those who became ill include 12 New Yorkers and two New Jersey residents, one of whom died. The CDC said a second death linked with the deli meat-related outbreak was reported in Illinois.\n\n\"The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,\" the agency warned. \"This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for Listeria. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.\"\n\nSymptoms of the infection listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and headaches. People who are pregnant, 65 or older, or have weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting sick, as listeria is more likely to spread from their guts to other parts of their bodies, according to the CDC. Severe listeriosis can cause pregnancy loss, premature birth, life-threatening infections in newborns, hospitalization and occasionally death.\n\nHealth officials are advising vulnerable groups to avoid recalled meats and refrain from eating other deli meats sliced at deli counters unless they're first reheated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees or until steaming hot. Officials also recommend that people at higher risk clean any refrigerators, containers and surfaces that might have come into contact with sliced deli meats.\n\nThe New York City health department told Gothamist last Friday that it was working to spread the word about the outbreak and make sure the recalled Boar's Head products were removed from stores. The owner of a cafe in SoHo said the company came to take away recalled merchandise, and two deli managers in the neighborhood said they were unaware of the initial recall.", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Dental", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Dental", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://api-prod.gothamist.com/images/346391/fill-1200x650|format-webp|webpquality-85/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777013", "eventUri": "eng-9777013", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-05-10", "dateEnd": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 704, "textEnd": 722}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "dateEnd": "-10-17", "textStart": 762, "textEnd": 785}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The products have sell-by dates ranging from July 29 to Oct. 17.\n\nThe issue was first discovered when the U.S. Food and Safety Inspection Service was notified that a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health from a store in the Baltimore area had tested positive for the same strain as the one responsible for the outbreak, the USDA said.\n\nAs of the latest numbers Tuesday, the listeria outbreak was to blame for sickening at least 34 people, two of whom had died, health officials said.\n\nThe USDA said the recalled products were shipped nationwide and some were exported to Mexico, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic and Panama. They were shipped to retailers with the establishment number \"EST. 12612\" or \"P-12612\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\n\nThe agency said there are concerns that some recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and in retail deli cases. Last week's initial recall prompted several supermarket chains to close their delis.\n\nSymptoms of listeria infection often include fever, muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhea. It can cause serious infections in people who are pregnant or age 65 and older, as well as those who have weakened immune systems, with symptoms including headaches, stiff neck, loss of balance, confusion and convulsions.\n\nFor those who are pregnant, a listeria infection can harm the baby, leading to \"miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn,\" the CDC warns.\n\nSymptoms usually start two weeks after eating contaminated food but can start as early as the same day or up to 10 weeks after, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antibiotics are used to treat listeria.\n\nCardiovascular disease specialist Dr. Nidhi Kumar told CBS New York Monday that listeria is a \"sturdy\" bacteria that can \"withstand high temperatures, like being in a freezer and even a regular refrigerator.\"\n\n\"If you did purchase deli meat and it's in your refrigerator, remember, this can contaminate entire surfaces. So you want to clean out your refrigerator with a bleach-based product,\" Kumar said.\n\nFor more information on the outbreak and the recall, visit the USDA's website or call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria", "type": "wiki",

Stop & Shop is in the process of removing all impacted products from sale,\" a statement to The Times from Stop & Shop said. \"In an abundance of caution, because this product is sliced in store, we are also in the process of discarding all other open deli meats and cheeses that could have been sliced or prepared in the same area and doing a deep cleaning of the deli. As always, ensuring the safety of the products we sell is our highest priority.\"\n\nMartha's Vineyard Hospital officials confirmed that there have been no cases of listeria on the Island reported to them, nor have there been any in the entire Mass General Brigham hospital system.\n\nAlready epidemiologic data show that meats sliced at delis may be contaminated with Listeria and can make people sick, according to the CDC. Listeria was found in an unopened package of Boar's Head liverwurst during the investigation, and more testing will see if it is the same strain that is making people sick.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control, or CDC is currently investigating the recent outbreak. As of July 26, 34 people have been infected from 13 states, including 2 individuals in Massachusetts. The CDC interviewed 33 people, who were all hospitalized. Two people died from the illness, one from Illinois and one from New Jersey.\n\nInvestigations by state and local public health officials found that 23 out of 24 people interviewed reported that they ate sliced meats at a deli in the month before they got sick. Recalled Boar's Head products include liverwurst, Virginia ham, Italian Cappy style ham, extra hot Italian style ham, bologna, beef salami, steakhouse roasted bacon, garlic bologna, and beef bologna.\n\nListeria can cause severe illness, also known as invasive listeriosis, though local doctors say that severe cases are extremely rare.\n\n\"Early symptoms of listeria would be similar to other typical foodborne gastroenteritis such as fever, watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and pains in joints and muscles,\" Dr. Ellen McMahon from the Island hospital said. \"In healthy people, it typically resolves quickly in about 2 days, and people have a full recovery.\"\n\nMcMahon added that severe cases are often only found in people who are immunocompromised, pregnant, older,

So far, 34 cases in 13 states have been reported, with 33 of those patients winding up in the hospital and two dying, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"Listeria is especially harmful to people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or with weakened immune systems,\" the agency said in a news release. \"[The] CDC always recommends people at higher risk for listeriosis avoid eating meats sliced at the deli or heat them to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or until steaming hot before eating.\"\n\nThe expanded recall includes 71 products made between May 10 and July 29 under the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names. The newly recalled items include meat to be sliced at delis and some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores. Liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products are affected.\n\nLast Friday, Boar's Head first announced it was recalling all of its liverwurst products because they could be tainted with listeria.\n\n\"The company is also recalling additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst and, therefore, may be adulterated with L. monocytogenes,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said in a statement.\n\nOverall, Boar's Head \"is recalling approximately 207,528 pounds of products,\" FSIS noted at the time.\n\nThe listeria investigation was first announced July 22 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAt the time, the source or sources of the outbreak were unknown.\n\nAs FSIS explained, testing first performed in Maryland spotted a sample of Boar's Head liverwurst product contaminated with listeria.\n\nBesides the liverwurst products, some of other Boar's Head meats that have been included in the recall include certain lots of Virginia Ham/Old Fashioned Ham, Italian Cappy Style Ham, various types of Bologna, Beef Salami, among others.\n\nMore from this section New York County Health Alert: Hidden Impact of Job Burnout on Your Mental Health.

Products were shipped to retailers nationwide.\n\nIf consumers find they have any of the recalled products in their fridges, they should discard them or return them to the place of purchase.\n\n\"Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross-contamination,\" FSIS added.\n\nDeli owners who find they have the products \"should clean and sanitize all food and non-food surfaces and discard any open meats and cheeses in the deli,\" the agency added.\n\nListeria bacteria can cause listeriosis, the third-leading cause of death from food-borne illness in the United States. Symptoms typically include a fever, muscle aches and fatigue. Infection may also cause a headache, a stiff neck, confusion or seizures. Pregnant women may experience pregnancy loss or premature birth.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about listeriosis at the CDC.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and

It follows an earlier recall of more than 200,000 pounds of sliced deli poultry and meat. The new items include meat intended to be sliced at delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores.\n\nThey include liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products made at the firm's Jarratt, Virginia, plant.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Nearly all of those who fell ill have been hospitalized. Illnesses were reported between late May and mid-July.\n\nThe problem was discovered when a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. Further testing showed that the type of bacteria was the same strain causing illnesses in people.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to immediately and voluntarily expand our recall to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility,\" the company said on its website. It has also halted production of ready-to-eat foods at the plant.\n\nThe meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama, Agriculture Department officials said.\n\nConsumers who have the recalled products in their homes should not eat them and should discard them or return them to stores for a refund, company officials said. Health officials said refrigerators should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination of other foods.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.\n\nListeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food.

Nearly all of those who fell ill have been hospitalized. Illnesses were reported between late May and mid-July.\n\nThe problem was discovered when a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. Further testing showed the type of bacteria was the same strain causing illnesses in people.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to immediately and voluntarily expand our recall to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility,\" the company said on its website.

Expands Recall for Ready-To-Eat Meat and Poultry Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination", "body": "WASHINGTON, July 30, 2024 - Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., a Jarratt, Va., establishment, is expanding its July 26, 2024, recall of deli meat products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The establishment is recalling approximately 7 million additional pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products. Whole genome sequencing results show that a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nThis expansion includes 71 products produced between May 10, 2024, and July 29, 2024, under the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names. These items include meat intended for slicing at retail delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold at retail locations. These products have \"sell by\" dates ranging from 29-JUL-2024 through 17-OCT-24. View full product list. View labels.\n\nThe products subject to recall were distributed to retail locations nationwide and some were exported to the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Panama. The products shipped to retailers bear establishment number \"EST. 12612\" or \"P-12612\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\n\nThe problem was discovered when FSIS was notified that a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for L. monocytogenes. The Maryland Department of Health, in collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department, collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for testing as part of an outbreak investigation of L. monocytogenes infections. Further testing determined the product sample tested positive for the outbreak strain. Anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.\n\nFSIS is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health partners to investigate the multistate outbreak of L. monocytogenes infections linked to meats sliced at delis. As of July 30, 2024, 34 sick people have been identified in 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths. Samples were collected from sick people from May 29, 2024, to July 12, 2024. The investigation is ongoing, and FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state partners. The CDC Food Safety Alert, Listeria Outbreak Linked to Meats Sliced at Delis, will continue to be updated with the latest investigation details.\n\nConsumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or with weakened immune systems. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.\n\nListeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In people who are pregnant, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.\n\nFSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' refrigerators and in retail deli cases. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them and retailers are urged not to sell these products with the referenced sell by dates. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross-contamination.\n\nFSIS recommends retail delis clean and sanitize all food and non-food surfaces and discard any open meats and cheeses in the deli. Retailers may refer to FSIS' guideline, Best Practices Guidance for Controlling Listeria monocytogenes in Retail Delicatessens, for information on steps to prevent certain ready-to-eat foods that are prepared or sliced in retail delis and consumed in the home, such as deli meats and deli salads, from becoming contaminated with L. monocytogenes.\n\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.\n\nConsumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., Customer Service at 1-800-352-6277. Media with questions can contact Elizabeth Ward, Vice President of Communications, Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., at media@boarshead.com.\n\nConsumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at

The decision to broaden the recall came after the company learned from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that a sample of its liverwurst from a Maryland store that had tested positive for listeria bacteria matched the strain in the nationwide outbreak.\n\n\"Based on this new information, we took steps to ensure we are doing everything possible to protect public health,\" Boar's Head said in a statement on its website on Tuesday. The company added that it had suspended operations involving ready-to-eat meats at the Jarratt facility until further notice.\n\nThe company announced its initial recall on July 25, calling back all products that had been processed on the same production line and on the same day, June 27, as the contaminated liverwurst. That recall amounted to 207, 528 pounds of meat comprising 10 different products sliced at deli counters and sold in retail stores.\n\nNow, the recall covers every item produced at the Virginia facility, a sweeping list of 71 products bearing the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names produced from May 10 through July 29, the U.S.D.A.'s Food Safety and Inspection Service said.\n\nThe list of products includes multipound loaves of \"Strassburger Brand Liverwurst MADE IN VIRGINIA\" with sell-by dates ranging from July 25 to Aug. 30 and meats made for slicing at delis with an Aug. 10 sell-by date. Some of those meats include: Virginia ham, Italian Cappy Ham, Extra Hot Italian Cappy Ham, Pork & Beef Bologna, Beef Salami, Beef Bologna and Garlic Bologna.\n\nThe company and the U.S.D.A. published a full list of recalled products online. (Product labels can be found here.)\n\nEarlier this month, the federal Centers for Disease Control announced the listeria outbreak and said that it could be linked to contaminated meat sold at delis. Further testing has since revealed that the strain making people sick is the same strain detected in the Boar's Head liverwurst in Maryland.\n\nSo far, two people have died and 34 have been sickened from the outbreak, including at least 33 who were hospitalized. The two deaths happened in New Jersey and Illinois, the agency said. The ages of those who got sick ranged from 32 to 94 years old with a median age of 74.\n\nThe people who have been sickened come from the following 13 states: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, the C.D.C. said.\n\nNew York, where Boar's Head branded meats are as ubiquitous as deli counters, has reported the highest number of sickened people, with 12, followed by Maryland with six people, according to the C.D.C.\n\nListeria is especially harmful to those who are pregnant, older than 65 or have weakened immune systems, according to the C.D.C.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In addition to the liverwurst, Boar's Head is recalling ham, bologna, salami, bacon and more products.\n\n\"The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified that a sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for L. monocytogenes. The Maryland Department of Health, in collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department, collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for testing as part of an outbreak investigation of L. monocytogenes infections,\" said the release.\n\nFSIS is working in tandem with the CDC and \"state public health partners to to investigate the multi-state outbreak.\" According to the FDA, \"34 sick people have been identified in 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths,\" as Salon previously reported.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lunch meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverwurst", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverwurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Safety_and_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food Safety and Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_&_Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food & Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Publix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Listeria monocytogenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Listeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_sausage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bologna sausage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelf life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bacon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/grocery_store_boars_head_deli_meats_1806590155.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777013", "eventUri": "eng-9777013", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "dateEnd": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1120, "textEnd": 1139}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It follows an earlier recall of more than 200,000 pounds of sliced deli poultry and meat. The new items include meat intended to be sliced at delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold in stores.\n\nThey include liverwurst, ham, beef salami, bologna and other products made at the firm's Jarratt, Virginia, plant.\n\nThe recalls are tied to an ongoing outbreak of listeria poisoning that has killed two people and sickened nearly three dozen in 13 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly all of those who fell ill have been hospitalized. Illnesses were reported between late May and mid-July.\n\nThe problem was discovered when a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. Further testing showed that the type of bacteria was the same strain causing illnesses in people.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to immediately and voluntarily expand our recall to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility,\" the company said on its website. It has also halted production of ready-to-eat foods at the plant.\n\nThe meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama, Agriculture Department officials said.\n\nConsumers who have the recalled products in their homes should not eat them and should discard them or return them to stores for a refund, company officials said. Health officials said refrigerators should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination of other foods.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.\n\nListeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food.

We have also decided to pause ready-to-eat operations at this facility until further notice.\"\n\nThursday's expansion includes 54 kinds of Boar's Head brand meats, including frankfurters, hams, olive loaf, head cheese and sausage. In addition, 17 kinds of Old Country hams sold to the food service industry (restaurants, caterers, cafeterias, etc.) got yanked.\n\nThey were produced from May 10 through Monday; have sell-by dates from Monday through Oct. 17; and carry \"EST. 12612\" or \"P-12612\" in the USDA inspection stamp. Some of these went to the Dominican Republic, Panama, Mexico and the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe USDA posted a full list of products in the expanded recall Tuesday night.\n\nWhat you should do if you have recalled meats?\n\nDon't eat any of the recalled meats. Return them to the store where you bought them for a full refund or, at least, throw them deep in the trash where pets can't get to them. Then, clean and sanitize any surfaces, such as counters and refrigerator drawers or shelves, that the meats might have touched.\n\nQuestions about this recall can be answered by calling Boar's Head Provisions at 800-352-6277.\n\nWhat's the latest on the listeria outbreak?\n\nAs of Friday's update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 34 people were sick in 13 states -- New York (12); Maryland (six); Missouri, Georgia, Massachusetts, Virginia, New Jersey (two each); North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Wisconsin (one each). There were 33 hospitalizations and there have been two deaths, one each in Illinois and New Jersey.\n\n\"Of the 24 people able to be interviewed, 23 reported eating meats sliced at a deli,\" the CDC said. \"Of the 23 people who were asked if they ate liverwurst, 13 reported deli-sliced liverwurst before getting sick, and seven reported Boar's Head brand. These deli meats were sliced at a variety of supermarket and grocery store delis.\"\n\nThe number of people who recover without receiving professional medical attention means official outbreak illness counts usually undercut the actual number sickened.\n\nWhat is listeria?\n\nAccording to the CDC, listeria infects only about 1,600 people in the United States each year, but kills about 260. Listeria can cause stillbirths and miscarriages in pregnant women. The most vulnerable to listeria's worst effects are people over 65 years old and children under 5. Most people get symptoms similar to the flu along with fever, headaches, stiff necks and poor balance.

That recall amounted to 207, 528 pounds of meat comprising 10 different products sliced at deli counters and sold in retail stores.\n\nNow, the recall covers every item produced at the Virginia facility, a sweeping list of 71 products bearing the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names produced from May 10 through July 29, the U.S.D.A.'s Food Safety and Inspection Service said.\n\nThe list of products includes multipound loaves of \"Strassburger Brand Liverwurst MADE IN VIRGINIA\" with sell-by dates ranging from July 25 to Aug. 30 and meats made for slicing at delis with an Aug. 10 sell-by date.

Anyone who has eaten any recalled product and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure.\n\nAlso, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.\n\nSymptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses.\n\nPregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, other complications and death.

These products have \"sell by\" dates ranging from 29-JUL-2024 through 17-OCT-24.\n\nThe products subject to recall were distributed to retail locations nationwide, and some were exported to the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama. The products shipped to retailers bear establishment number \"EST. 12612\" or \"P-12612\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\n\nThe problem was discovered when FSIS was notified that a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for L. monocytogenes. The Maryland Department of Health, in collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department, collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for testing as part of an outbreak investigation of L. monocytogenes infections. Further testing determined the product sample tested positive for the outbreak strain. Anyone concerned about illness should contact a health care provider.\n\nFSIS is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health partners to investigate the multistate outbreak of L. monocytogenes infections linked to meats sliced at delis. As of July 30, 2024, 34 sick people have been identified in 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths. Samples were collected from sick people from May 29 to July 12, 2024. The investigation is ongoing, and FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state partners. The CDC Food Safety Alert, Listeria Outbreak Linked to Meats Sliced at Delis, will continue to be updated with the latest investigation details.\n\nConsumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have weakened immune systems. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.\n\nListeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In people who are pregnant, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.\n\nFSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' refrigerators and in retail deli cases. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them, and retailers are urged not to sell these products with the referenced sell-by dates. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross contamination.\n\nFSIS recommends retail delis clean and sanitize all food and nonfood surfaces and discard any open meats and cheeses in the deli. Retailers may refer to FSIS' guideline, Best Practices Guidance for Controlling Listeria monocytogenes in Retail Delicatessens, for information on steps to prevent certain ready-to-eat foods that are prepared or sliced in retail delis and consumed in the home, such as deli meats and deli salads, from becoming contaminated with L. monocytogenes.\n\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Possible listeria contamination also led to nearly 20 kinds of vegetables, sold between July 5-12, being recalled at Aldi, Kroger and Walmart locations across the U.S., including Connecticut; more information on that can be found here.\n\nAccording to the CDC, listeria is a bacteria that can cause serious illness or death and is especially dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly. More information about listeria can be found here.\n\nAll customers who purchased any impacted Boar's Head products are recommended to discard them and are eligible for a full refund, according to the Stop & Shop website. Customers who purchased products in the store can get a refund by visiting the store, and those who purchased them online for pick-up or delivery can call customer service for a refund at 1-800-767-7772.\n\nStop & Shop said that anyone who purchased in-store sliced deli meats and cheese products before July 30, including online and in-person orders, is encouraged to discard them \"out of an abundance of caution, due to the risk of cross-contamination.\" According to their website, any deli items purchased before July 30 are eligible for a full refund.\n\nCustomers who purchased the affected products are also asked by the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service to clean their refrigerators to lower the risk of cross-contamination. Anyone feeling ill as a result of consuming any of the products should contact their health care provider immediately.\n\nAnyone with questions regarding the recall can call Boar's Head at 1-800-352-6277.\n\n---\n\nDo you have a story idea or something on your mind you want to share?

Nearly all of those who fell ill have been hospitalized. Illnesses were reported between late May and mid-July.\n\nThe problem was discovered when a liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. Further testing showed that the type of bacteria was the same strain causing illnesses in people.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to immediately and voluntarily expand our recall to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility,\" the company said on its website. It has also halted production of ready-to-eat foods at the plant.\n\nThe meat was distributed to stores nationwide, as well as to the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama, Agriculture Department officials said.\n\nConsumers who have the recalled products in their homes should not eat them and should discard them or return them to stores for a refund, company officials said. Health officials said refrigerators should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination of other foods.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.\n\nListeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food. The infections are especially dangerous for people older than 65, those with weakened immune systems and during pregnacy.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

EXPANDS RECALL FOR READY-TO-EAT MEAT AND POULTRY PRODUCTS DUE TO POSSIBLE LISTERIA CONTAMINATIONWASHINGTON, July 30, 2024 - Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., a Jarratt, Va., establishment, is expanding its July 26, 2024, recall of deli meat products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The establishment is recalling approximately 7 million additional pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products. Whole genome sequencing results show that a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nThis expansion includes 71 products produced between May 10, 2024, and July 29, 2024, under the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names. These items include meat intended for slicing at retail delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold at retail locations. These products have \"sell by\" dates ranging from 29-JUL-2024 through 17-OCT-24. View full product list. View labels.\n\nThe products subject to recall were distributed to retail locations nationwide and some were exported to the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Panama. The products shipped to retailers bear establishment number \"EST. 12612\" or \"P-12612\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\n\nThe problem was discovered when FSIS was notified that a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for L. monocytogenes. The Maryland Department of Health, in collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department, collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for testing as part of an outbreak investigation of L. monocytogenes infections. Further testing determined the product sample tested positive for the outbreak strain. Anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.\n\nFSIS is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health partners to investigate the multistate outbreak of L. monocytogenes infections linked to meats sliced at delis. As of July 30, 2024, 34 sick people have been identified in 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths. Samples were collected from sick people from May 29, 2024, to July 12, 2024. The investigation is ongoing, and FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state partners. The CDC Food Safety Alert, Listeria Outbreak Linked to Meats Sliced at Delis, will continue to be updated with the latest investigation details.\n\nConsumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or with weakened immune systems. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.\n\nListeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In people who are pregnant, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.\n\nFSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' refrigerators and in retail deli cases. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them and retailers are urged not to sell these products with the referenced sell by dates. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross-contamination.\n\nFSIS recommends retail delis clean and sanitize all food and non-food surfaces and discard any open meats and cheeses in the deli. Retailers may refer to FSIS' guideline, Best Practices Guidance for Controlling Listeria monocytogenes in Retail Delicatessens, for information on steps to prevent certain ready-to-eat foods that are prepared or sliced in retail delis and consumed in the home, such as deli meats and deli salads, from becoming contaminated with L. monocytogenes.\n\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.\n\nConsumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., Customer Service at 1-800-352-6277. Media with questions can contact Elizabeth Ward, Vice President of Communications, Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., at media@boarshead.com.\n\nConsumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 888-MPHotline (888-674-6854) or send a question via email to MPHotline@usda.gov. For consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eCCF/.\n\n###\n\nNOTE: Access news releases and other information at FSIS' website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.\n\nFollow FSIS on X at twitter.com/usdafoodsafety or in Spanish at: twitter.com/usdafoodsafe_es.\n\nUSDA RECALL CLASSIFICATIONS Class I This is a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.

The investigation is ongoing, and FSIS continues to work with the CDC and state partners. The CDC Food Safety Alert, Listeria Outbreak Linked to Meats Sliced at Delis, will continue to be updated with the latest investigation details.\n\nConsumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or with weakened immune systems. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.\n\nListeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In people who are pregnant, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.\n\nFSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' refrigerators and in retail deli cases. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them and retailers are urged not to sell these products with the referenced sell by dates.", "source": {"uri":

Let it cool before you eat it. Listeria can grow on foods kept in the refrigerator, but it is easily killed by heating food to a high enough temperature.Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: People who are not pregnant usually have fever, muscle aches, and tiredness.

Everything you need to know about the Boar's Head meat recall", "body": "By Cindy Krischer Goodman | cgoodman@sunsentinel.com | South Florida Sun Sentinel\n\nPublix subs, also known as \"Pub Subs,\" are popular and considered a Southern favorite, but some Floridians are afraid to eat them now.\n\nBoar's Head, the most popular brand of deli meats sold at Publix and used in Pub Subs, has recalled all deli meats products made at its Jarratt, Virginia, facility. Pub Sub lovers often want Boar's Head meats in their subs, along with the cheese and veggies.\n\nThe Boar's Head recall stems from a Listeria outbreak that has sickened people in 13 states. While Florida has no reported cases of Listeria tied to deli meats at this time, Publix had sold meats from the Virginia facility at some of its stores. On Thursday, Boar's Head recalled 71 products produced between May 10, 2024, and July 29, 2024, under the Boar's Head and Old Country brand names. The recall started with Boar's Head Liverwurst and has expanded to include hams, bologna, bacon, sausage, salami and frankfurters.\n\nA liverwurst sample collected by health officials in Maryland tested positive for listeria. Further testing showed that the type of bacteria was the same strain causing the illnesses.\n\n\"We have removed all products from the impacted facility from every Publix location,\" said Lindsey Willis, Publix Super Markets Media Relations Manager. \"All Publix delis are open.\" The company did not break out which locations sold the potentially contaminated meats.\n\nStop & Shop locations in Connecticut temporarily closed their delis this week for deep cleaning and sanitization after Boar's Head recalled more products due to concerns over listeria. Publix does not need to do that, according to Willis.\n\n\"We have cleaning protocols and sanitation practices that take place in our delis every day and every evening,\" Willis said.\n\nAs of July 30, 2024, 34 sick people have been identified in 13 states (Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin), including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths. Samples were collected from sick people from May 29, 2024, to July 12, 2024. The investigation into the outbreak is ongoing. Federal health officials are concerned that some products may be in consumers' refrigerators and in retail deli cases. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them.\n\nFlorida Department of Health officials did not respond to repeated requests for information on whether any Florida cases have been reported.\n\nSomeone infected by Listeriosis may experience symptoms immediately -- or up to two months after eating the contaminated deli meat.\n\nListeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is particularly dangerous for anyone pregnant. The infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. Older people or anyone with weakened immune systems also are at higher risk. Listeriosis typically is treated with antibiotics.\n\nAlthough Publix has tossed many of the Boar's Head meats, Pub Sub lovers have other options.\n\n\"If ordering a sub, we do have some Boar's Head meats available since they came from a different facility,\" Willis said. \"We also have Publix and other brand deli meats available for subs at our deli.\"\n\nSome small specialty grocers in Florida, such as Milam's Market and Detwilers Farm Market, also carry Boar's Head products. Winn Dixie carries Dietz & Watson deli meats as their Boar's Head equivalent.\n\nHealth officials encourage consumers to check their fridges, discard any recalled products listed on the Boar's Head website, or return them to the store where they purchased them for a full refund. Anyone with the contaminated meats should thoroughly clean and sanitize their refridgerators to prevent contamination of other foods", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news",

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nMore than 30 people were sickened in 13 states, according to the FDA -- Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland -- and two people died.\n\nBoar's Head Provisions Co. recalled liverwurst after a sample of the product in a Maryland store tested positive for listeria, and the company has also recalled meats sliced on the same day on the same line as the liverwurst at a Virginia plant. Those include Virginia old fashioned ham, Italian Cappy style ham, extra hot Italian Cappy style ham, bologna, beef salami, steakhouse roasted bacon ham and garlic bologna with an Aug. 10 sell-by date. Boar's Head second recall, announced Tuesday, includes 71 different products made between May 10 and July 29. More specifics can be found on the USDA website. The outbreak has been linked to meat sliced at deli counters, not prepackaged meats.\n\nThe listeria bacteria can be found in soil, water, animal feces and raw materials. The CDC says cold cuts, cheeses and other deli products are at particular risk of listeria because of how easy it is for the bacteria to spread among deli equipment and surfaces. While meats are kept refrigerated, refrigeration does not kill listeria, and it can be a tough bacteria to eliminate. When meats are prepared at a facility where listeria persists, the bacteria can spread on surfaces, hands and through the food itself. One person died and 16 were sickened due to a listeria outbreak among deli meats and cheeses in six states in 2022, and a similar outbreak killed one and sickened another 12 in four states in 2020.\n\nWalmart has recalled bagged and bulk produce in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Aldi locations in Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia have done the same. Other stores, including Save-a-Lot, Kroger, Shop 'n Save, have also recalled products in the states listed above and Maine, Missouri, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Tennessee.\n\nBagged poblanos, cubanelle peppers, green beans, salad cucumbers, serranos, organic bell peppers, cucumbers, yellow squash and zucchini from the Wiers Farm have been recalled, as have bagged green beans and jalapenos from Freshire Farms. Bulk Anaheim peppers, clinanto, cubanelle peppers, cucumbers, green beans, green bell peppers, habanero peppers, hungarian wax peppers, jalapeno peppers, mustard greens, pickling cucumbers, parsley, poblanos, serranos and tomatillos have also been recalled, though no specific brand names were mentioned. The barcodes for each recalled product can be found on the FDA's website.\n\nA Missouri couple has sued Boar's Head and Schnucks Markets after they purchased contaminated liverwurst in June. Sue Fleming, 88, became \"deathly ill\" and was hospitalized with a listeria infection, according to her lawyer. She did recover from the illness after a long stay in a hospital, followed by a stay at a rehabilitation facility. The couple is now suing for $25,000 in damages and claims the illness caused \"loss of enjoyment of life\" and \"damage to the marital relationship.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType":

The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and their newborns, adults aged 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nSymptoms of intestinal illness\n\nIntestinal illness is not often diagnosed because laboratories do not often test stool samples for listeria.\n\nSymptoms usually start within 24 hours after eating contaminated food. The symptoms usually last one to three days.\n\nThe symptoms are usually mild, but some people with intestinal illness develop invasive illness, which can be more severe.\n\nSymptoms of intestinal illness include:\n\nDiarrheaVomitingSymptoms of invasive illness\n\nInvasive illness means the bacteria have spread beyond the intestines. Symptoms of invasive illness usually start within two weeks after eating food contaminated with listeria.\n\nPeople who are pregnant may experience different symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Symptoms in pregnant people are usually mild, and some pregnant people never even have symptoms.\n\nInfection during pregnancy usually leads to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\n\nPeople who are pregnant may experience the following symptoms:\n\nFeverFlu-like symptomsMuscle achesFatigue\n\nSymptoms in people who are not pregnant can be severe.

Authorities say further testing is required to determine whether any recalled products are linked to this outbreak.\n\nThe Virginia-based meat producer recalled approximately 207,528 pounds of products that were distributed to retail deli locations nationwide, including all liverwurst products and \"additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst\" that could be \"adulterated with L. monocytogenes.\"\n\nThe newly added items \"include meat intended for slicing at retail delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold at retail locations,\" FSIS stated Wednesday. \"These products have 'sell by' dates ranging from 29-JUL-2024 through 17-OCT-24.\"\n\nClick here for the full list of product details with item numbers, brand names and sell by dates.\n\nThe ready-to-eat liverwurst products were produced between June 11, 2024, and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf life.\n\nRecalled liverwurst products include 3.5-pound loaves in plastic casing, or \"various weight packages sliced in retail delis,\" according to the FSIS, and are labeled \"Boar's Head Strassburger Brand Liverwurst MADE IN VIRGINIA.\"\n\nThe products, which the FSIS said were shipped to retailers, bear sell by dates ranging from July 25 to Aug. 30, 2024. Sell by dates are printed on the side of the packaging.\n\nClick here for images with full label details.\n\nAdditional ready-to-eat deli meats subject to recall\n\nThe recalled products bear establishment number \"EST. 12612\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\n\nThe above products were produced on June 27, 2024, according to Boar's Head.\n\nAccording to the USDA, the problem was discovered when the FSIS \"was notified that a sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for L. monocytogenes.\"\n\n\"The Maryland Department of Health, in collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department, collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for testing as part of an outbreak investigation of L. monocytogenes infections,\" the agency stated. \"Further testing is ongoing to determine if the product sample is related to the outbreak. Anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press on Friday, Boar's Head said, \"We are cooperating fully with government authorities and conducting our own investigation into this incident.\"\n\nThe FSIS is currently working with the CDC as well as state public health partners to investigate a multistate outbreak of listeria infections linked to meats sliced at delis, USDA officials said this week.\n\nAccording to the agency, as of July 25, \"34 sick people have been identified in 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths.\"\n\nAs of July 19, states involved in the outbreak included Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.\n\n\"Samples were collected from sick people from May 29, 2024, to July 12, 2024,\" the USDA stated this week, adding that \"the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nIn a notice published July 19, the CDC stated that many of those sickened in the outbreak had reported eating meat that they had sliced at deli counters.\n\n\"Investigators are collecting information to determine the specific products that may be contaminated,\" the CDC stated.\n\n\"Listeria spreads easily among deli equipment, surfaces, hands and food,\" the agency added. \"Refrigeration does not kill Listeria, but reheating to a high enough temperature before eating will kill any germs that may be on these meats.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, listeria can cause severe illness \"when the bacteria spread beyond the gut to other parts of the body\" after a person consumes contaminated food. Those at higher risk include pregnant people, those aged 65 or older, or anyone who has a weakened immune system, the CDC says.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, it can cause pregnancy loss, premature birth, or a life-threatening infection in your newborn,\" the CDC states on its website. \"Other people can be infected with Listeria, but they rarely become seriously ill.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, anyone infected with listeria may experience \"mild food poisoning symptoms\" such as diarrhea or fever, and many recover without antibiotic treatment.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

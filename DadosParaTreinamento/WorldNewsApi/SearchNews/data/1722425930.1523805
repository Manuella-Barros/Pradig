Six more doses of semi-final suffering followed that initial heartbreak at the 1992 ODI tournament , when heavy showers and a quickly discredited rain rule ended South Africa\u2019s hopes of a triumphant return to the global stage. Chasing England\u2019s target of 253, South Africa needed 22 runs from 13 balls when rain interrupted play at the SCG. After the skies cleared and play was set to resume, England\u2019s two lowest-scoring overs were wiped from their total and the recalculations reduced South Africa\u2019s target to 21\u2026 from one delivery. Rain might well come into play again when South Africa face India in the 2024 T20 World Cup final at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, with wet weather forecast across Barbados on Saturday. But even if the match is reduced from 20 overs each, the impact on the result should be a far cry from the outrage 32-years ago when South Africa\u2019s World Cup hoodoo began. The DLS method now used in limited-over cricket matches is the legacy of English statisticians Frank Duckworth, who died on 21 June aged 84, and Tony Lewis, who passed away in 2020 aged 78. It might not be a simple system for the ordinary fan \u2013 and seemingly most commentators \u2013 to comprehend, but the current custodian Steven Stern is adamant that the method is the most statistically fair. \u201cFrank\u2019s perspective on this as a cricket fan is always interesting to me, because I\u2019m a mathematician by trade, a data analyst,\u201d Stern, a professor of data science at Bond University, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cHe was quite quick in keeping me grounded, saying, \u2018Simple is better unless we need to go complicated, as long as a simple approach gives us something that\u2019s justifiable\u2019. He wanted the method to be understandable to your rank and file fan.\u201d The original \u2018DL\u2019 method created by Duckworth and Lewis was born out of the 1992 debacle \u2013 which the former dubbed \u201ca fair result in foul weather\u201d \u2013 and officially adopted by the International Cricket Council in 1999. It remains the basis for the system that rain-affected limited-over matches are now decided under, although there have been several tweaks over the years. Stern put the S into \u2018DLS\u2019 when his work was incorporated into a significant update released in 2014 and, following the retirement of Duckworth and Lewis the same year, he has held the reins ever since. The Australian statistician is currently working on an annual review, but does not expect the first significant change in a decade to be needed this time around. \u201cI do a reanalysis every year using a four-year window,\u201d Stern says. \u201cSo every July 1st, I use the previous four years from that point, so there\u2019s a new analysis but with three years of overlap with the previous analysis. \u201cI look at all of the DLS matches that actually occurred in the past four years and say, \u2018With this new method that I\u2019ve just developed with the current analysis, what targets would it have set?\u2019. If those targets only changed by one or two runs, well that\u2019s within the run of play, we\u2019re not going to make a change. \u201cBut as soon as we start seeing it\u2019s out by three or four runs, maybe the patterns have changed enough. Then we have a discussion with the ICC about whether that is big enough for us to make a change.\u201d The last overhaul in 2014 was sparked by \u201cthe T20 revolution\u201d. \u201cBatters realised in a very short span of time what was really possible in those last 10 overs, or that you can score 80 runs in the last five if you really went for it,\u201d Stern adds. \u201cThat caused a fundamental shift in the way that the method worked, when the scores got really, really big.\u201d Stern is now paying closer attention to the \u201crelative impact of partnerships\u201d, as the leading sides are more likely to save their big-hitting weapons for further down the order, and the depth at emerging nations continues to grow. But while Stern and the ICC are open to having separate DLS methods for men\u2019s and women\u2019s matches, if the data calls for it, there is no evidence of that being needed at this stage. \u201cThe method still works perfectly for women\u2019s cricket despite the fact that they score fewer runs,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThe reason is that the method only works on percentages. So even though women score on average about 50 runs fewer, when they score those runs during the innings, the percentage that\u2019s at the end, versus the percentage in the middle and at the beginning, is almost identical to the men.\u201d The method became a key part of the drama in 2024, amid the chaotic finale to the T20 World Cup group stage when Afghanistan all-rounder Gulbadin Naib feigned injury as DLS calculations were being made, rather than the method directly influencing the result. This is much as Duckworth could surely have hoped for. \u201cFrank Duckworth is, at least from a professional perspective, the most generous human being I have ever known in my life,\u201d Stern says. \u201cWhenever I do the yearly calculations, I will think about him. And fortunately, his name will be remembered for as long as we play cricket.\u201d", "summary": "<p>If rain stops play in the T20 World Cup final, a fair result will depend on Professor Steve Stern, the Australian data analyst charged with cricket\u2019s complex and controversial DLS system</p><p>It has taken 32 years for South Africa to vanquish the demons of a rain-affected semi-final defeat to England and finally secure a spot in the decider at a men\u2019s World Cup.

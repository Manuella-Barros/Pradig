However, only one team has done it consistently and successfully, which is the Orange Army.\n\nPat Cummins' Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) are one of the most dangerous teams in IPL 2024 as their ultra-aggressive batting unit can demolish any bowling line-up on a given day and they are currently at the third position on the points table with 10 points in their bag.\n\nFaf du Plessis' Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), meanwhile, have been overall very poor with their performances as out of 8 matches they have won just one to see themselves at the very bottom of the standings. Mathematically, the fan favorites - RCB - are not out of the playoffs race, but something needs to change significantly for RCB to reach the playoffs this time around.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru won the toss and opted to bat first in the match. They fielded an unchanged playing XI for the high-voltage clash. At the toss, Faf du Plessis was hopeful of posting a big score on the board. Faf du Plessis was also happy to see the amount of support RCB were getting in the away match in Hyderabad. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru skipper said:\n\n\"We are gonna bat first. We feel like our fans go with us everywhere. These boys have been playing some amazing cricket, hopefully we can put some scoreboard pressure on them. We fought really hard in the last game. Same team.\"\n\nMeanwhile, SRH captain Pat Cummins talked about the SRH fans and revealed that they have made one change to their line-up by bringing in Jaydev Unadkat for Washington Sundar. Pat Cummins stated:\n\n\"It's been awesome, good to be back here. It's my first year here. The amount of people wearing orange, feels like a good place. We want to bat the same way. We have to adjust quicker as a bowling side. Unadkat comes in for Washington Sundar.\"\n\nSRH vs RCB: Impact Players -\n\nSRH - Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Travis Head\n\nRCB - Vijaykumar Vyshak, Suyash Prabhudessai, Anuj Rawat, Himanshu Sharma, Swapnil Singh\n\nSRH vs RCB: Playing XIs -\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan\n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore (Playing XI): Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis(c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik(w), Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Sundar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Sundar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijaykumar_Vyshak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijaykumar Vyshak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

In the previous fixture between these two sides earlier this season, SRH had belted 287 runs on the board, bettering their own record of the highest team total in IPL history. The SRH batsmen have been in red-hot form, and more of the same can be expected to continue against the RCB bowling attack. RCB, with a gut-wrenching one-run loss to Kolkata Knight Riders in the previous game, are all but eliminated from the race to the playoffs.\n\nMathematically, RCB are still alive. With just one win from eight games, they will have to win all six of their remaining games in order to stay in the hunt for a top-four. Of course, other results will need to go their way, not to mention that their net run rate will have to be better than other teams that finish on 14 points.

RCB ended their six-match losing streak with a strong outing in all facets of the game. The pitch falling on the slower side played in the favour of the visitors.\n\nUnlike previous games, the destructive opening duo of SRH failed to spread their wings in the powerplay. Will Jacks dismissed Travis Head (1) on the final delivery of the first over. Abhishek Sharma (31) showed intent but Yash Dayal got the better of the young left-handed opener in the fourth over.\n\nThe middle-order set-up that has backed the opening duo failed to pull SRH out of their distress. The spin duo of Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma made short work of the hosts' middle-order set-up and put RCB in the driver's seat. Skipper Pat Cummins tried to raise hopes of an unprecedented comeback with his quick-fire 31 off 15 deliveries. Shahbaz Ahmed on the other end continued to wage a lone battle but SRH fell short by 35 runs at the end.\n\nEarlier in the innings, RCB opted to bat first, star batter Virat Kohli and skipper Faf du Plessis made sure to give RCB a strong start with the bat as the opening pair hammered SRH bowlers all around the ground. Captain Pat Cummins then brought T Natarajan into the attack and the bowler gave his team a much-needed breakthrough as he dismissed the RCB skipper, Faf du Plessis. A slower bouncer by Natarajan got the better of du Plessis.\n\nMayank Markande was brought into the attack by Cummins, which proved fruitful as he bagged the wicket of Will Jacks, who was never looking stable at the crease. Rajat Patidar with his sensational onslaught over Mayank Markande's third over of the night as he hammered the bowler for 27 runs. The star batter Patidar also brought up his 50-partnership with Kohli while also smashing fifty in 19 balls.\n\nJaydev Unadkat got the big wicket for SRH, as he dismissed the in-form Patidar on the very next ball after completing his fifty. Kohli slammed a resilient fifty within 37 balls, however, the former RCB skipper was dismissed by Unadkat with a power-less shot after scoring 51 runs in 43 deliveries. Unadkat bagged his third wicket of the night in his 100th IPL match, as he dismissed Mahipal Lomror.\n\nAfter losing wickets at regular intervals, RCB was successful in scoring 206/7 in 20 overs. Brief score: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad 170/8 (Shahbaz Ahmed 40*, Pat Cummins 31; Cameron Green 2-12).

It will be a showdown between Faf du Plessis's Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Pat Cummins's Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in today's match.\n\nRight now, Royal Challengers Bengaluru is in 10th position with only 2 points to their tally and a net run rate of -1.046 on the IPL 2024 points table, and Sunrisers Hyderabad are in third position with 10 points and a net run rate of 0.914. In the last game against each other this season on Monday, April 15 at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, SRH scored 287 runs, beating their own record, and defeated RCB by 25 runs. Their batters are doing well, so they might keep it up against RCB. RCB lost a close game to Kolkata Knight Riders, so they probably won't make it to the playoffs.\n\nBefore their upcoming match on Thursday, April 25, SRH and RCB have faced each other in 24 matches In IPL history. Royal Challengers Bengaluru won 10 games, while Sunrisers Hyderabad won 13 times and 1 match ending with no results.\n\nBat 1st: Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Virat Kohli, Will Jacks, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Saurav Chauhan, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Vyshak Vijayakumar, Reece Topley, Lockie Ferguson.\n\nBowl 1st: Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Saurav Chauhan, Mahipal Lomror, Vyshak Vijayakumar, Reece Topley, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Siraj.\n\nImpact Players Option: Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Reece Topley\n\nBat 1st: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan\n\nBowl 1st: Travis Head, Nitish Reddy , Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan\n\nImpact Players Option: Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen, Pat Cummins\n\nSRH vs RCB Dream11 Prediction for Today's Game (IPL Match 41)\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are facing off again in the IPL 2024. SRH led by Pat Cummins recently won big against Delhi Capitals. But RCB, under Faf du Plessis, lost a close one to Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nSRH's batters, like Travis Head, are doing great. They scored over 250 three times this season, with their highest score against RCB.\n\nRCB struggled to stop KKR's batting, but they've been good at chasing high scores this season. However, they'll face a tough challenge in Hyderabad.\n\nIn past games, SRH has won 13 times against RCB's 10 wins, with one draw. In the last 5 matches, SRH won 3 and RCB won 2 matches. At Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, SRH usually does better, winning 6 out of 8 games against RCB.\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad is famous for its pitches that favor batsmen. Picture yourself on a pitch that's perfect for hitting, just like when Sunrisers Hyderabad scored a huge 277 runs against Mumbai Indians. That match had a whopping total of over 500 runs! In the beginning, don't expect much help for bowlers with the new ball. Fast bowlers, be cautious - this pitch won't give you many advantages. Hyderabad is definitely a dream for batsmen, so get ready to swing those bats!\n\nThe weather forecast for the match in Hyderabad looks good, with no rain expected even though it might be cloudy. This means the game can go on without any interruptions. The temperature will be nice, around 34 degrees Celsius, with light breezes at 13 km/hr and moderate humidity at 25%. These conditions will be great for both players and fans to enjoy the game.\n\nAbhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Agarwal\n\nFaf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai, Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Manoj Bhandage, Mayank Dagar, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Himanshu Sharma, Rajan Kumar, Cameron Green, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Swapnil Singh, Saurav Chauhan.\n\n(Note: Above team standing as of April 25th before RCB vs SRH match)\n\nDisclaimer: The Dream 11 team predictions provided in this article are based on analysis of recent player performance, team form, past encounters, and expert opinions.

The pitch falling on the slower side played in the favour of the visitors.\n\nAlso Read | IPL 2024: Gulbadin Naib Replaces Injured Mitchell Marsh in Delhi Capitals' Squad for Remainder of Season.\n\nUnlike previous games, the destructive opening duo of SRH failed to spread their wings in the powerplay. Will Jacks dismissed Travis Head (1) on the final delivery of the first over.\n\nAbhishek Sharma (31) showed intent but Yash Dayal got the better of the young left-handed opener in the fourth over.\n\nAlso Read | SRH 171/8 in 20 Overs (Target 207) | SRH vs RCB Live Score Updates of IPL 2024: Royal Challengers Bengaluru Win By 35 Runs.\n\nThe middle-order set-up that has backed the opening duo failed to pull SRH out of their distress. The spin duo of Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma made short work of the hosts' middle-order set-up and put RCB in the driver's seat.\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins tried to raise hopes of an unprecedented comeback with his quick-fire 31 off 15 deliveries. Shahbaz Ahmed on the other end continued to wage a lone battle but SRH fell short by 35 runs at the end.\n\nEarlier in the innings, RCB opted to bat first, star batter Virat Kohli and skipper Faf du Plessis made sure to give RCB a strong start with the bat as the opening pair hammered SRH bowlers all around the ground.\n\nCaptain Pat Cummins then brought T Natarajan into the attack and the bowler gave his team a much-needed breakthrough as he dismissed the RCB skipper, Faf du Plessis. A slower bouncer by Natarajan got the better of du Plessis.\n\nMayank Markande was brought into the attack by Cummins, which proved fruitful as he bagged the wicket of Will Jacks, who was never looking stable at the crease.\n\nRajat Patidar with his sensational onslaught over Mayank Markande's third over of the night as he hammered the bowler for 27 runs. The star batter Patidar also brought up his 50-partnership with Kohli while also smashing fifty in 19 balls.\n\nJaydev Unadkat got the big wicket for SRH, as he dismissed the in-form Patidar on the very next ball after completing his fifty.\n\nKohli slammed a resilient fifty within 37 balls, however, the former RCB skipper was dismissed by Unadkat with a power-less shot after scoring 51 runs in 43 deliveries. Unadkat bagged his third wicket of the night in his 100th IPL match, as he dismissed Mahipal Lomror.\n\nAfter losing wickets at regular intervals, RCB was successful in scoring 206/7 in 20 overs.\n\nBrief score: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad 170/8 (Shahbaz Ahmed 40*, Pat Cummins 31; Cameron Green 2-12).

Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to lock horns with Royal Challengers Bengaluru in match number 41 of IPL 2024 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nIn 249 matches so far, RCB has won 117 and lost 128. Four games have ended with no results. Their win percentage is 46.18 per cent. RCB has been a three-time IPL finalist in 2009, 2011 and 2016. However, they have not lifted the trophy even once.\n\nRCB will be playing their 250th IPL game when they take on the SRH at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad on Thursday. This completes a big milestone of their journey, which has seen a lot of ups and downs and the creation of some of the biggest league superstars and a loyal fanbase despite not clinching a title yet.\n\nThe IPL 2024 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru will be broadcasted live on the Star Sports Network. Viewers can also watch the live stream of the SRH vs RCB IPL 2024 match on the JioCinema app and website.\n\nSRH bested RCB on an evening that produced the highest IPL total and the highest match aggregate in all T20s. They posted a record 287 for 3 on the back of Head's 102 and Klaasen's 31-ball 67. RCB then finished on 262 for 7, Dinesh Karthik leading the way with 83 off 35 balls as they eventually fell 25 runs short at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.\n\nVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Siraj\n\nAbhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru have locked their horns 24 times in the IPL so far. SRH won 13 while RCB managed to win 10 matches while 1 got no result (NR). None of the matches were abandoned due to any reason. So SRH has the upper hand in this match over RCB as they play match number 41 in IPL 2024.\n\nThe temperature is expected to be around 36 degree Celcius, with humidity at 22 percent. There is no chance of rainfall in Hyderabad on April 25.\n\nThe upcoming match will unfold on the very same pitch that witnessed the opening game of the season at this venue. It was a spectacle as SRH unleashed a monumental total of 277 for 3 while batting first against Mumbai Indians, who themselves managed a commendable 246 for 5. Anticipate another high-scoring showdown as both the teams lock horns once again. With Hyderabad forecasted to experience scorching temperatures on Thursday evening, conditions are set to add to the intensity of the encounter.\n\nToss will play an important role in Hyderabad as it's a batsman friendly pitch which witnessed some huge scores in the tournament itself. Due will also play an important factor in the second inning of the match.

Faf du Plessis & Co. are currently reeling at the bottom of the points table with just one win from eight matches this season.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad, on the other hand, have been in red-hot form with their batters firing all cylinders. The likes of Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen have been going all guns blazing with the bat and have tormented bowling attacks. Head and Abhishek have been explosive at the top while Klaasen has provided firepower in the middle order.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad went berserk as they shattered their own record to post the highest-ever IPL total of 287 runs in their last meeting against RCB at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. Head slammed a sensational ton while Klaasen scored a blistering half-century as the duo mauled the RCB bowling attack. However, despite conceding the highest total in the tournament history, RCB lost the game by only 25 runs.\n\nRCB bowlers will have their task cut out as they gear up for the reverse fixture against high-flying SRH. Head and Sharma will be looking to once again get their team off to a flyer as they aim to continue their stellar run in the tournament. RCB bowlers will have to be on top of their game if they are to halt SRH's rampage in Hyderabad.\n\nWhen will the IPL 2024 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru be played?\n\nThe IPL 2024 match between SRH and RCB will be played on Thursday, April 25.\n\nWhat time will the SRH vs RCB IPL 2024 match begin?\n\nThe IPL 2024 match between SRH and RCB will begin at 7:30 PM IST with the toss scheduled at 7:00 PM IST.\n\nWhere will the IPL 2024 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru be played?\n\nThe IPL 2024 match between SRH and RCB will be played at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi.\n\nWhere to watch the SRH vs RCB IPL 2024 match on television in India?\n\nThe IPL 2024 match between SRH and RCB will be telecasted live on the Star Sports Network.\n\nWhere to watch the online streaming of the IPL 2024 match between SRH and RCB?\n\nThe Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru IPL 2024 match can be live streamed on the Jio Cinema app and the website.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad have an edge over Royal Challengers Bengaluru when it comes to the head-to-head record between the two teams in the IPL. The two sides have played 24 matches against each other with SRH wining 13 matches compared to RCB's 10. 1 game ended in a no result. SRH defeated RCB by 25 runs in their last meeting this season.\n\nThe weather in Hyderabad is expected to remain hot throughout the day on Thursday. There is no rain forecast and the game is expected to be conducted smoothly without any interruptions. However, the players will have to be wary of the heat which can cause some trouble.\n\nThe pitch at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad is expected to be slightly on the slower side. There could be some help on the offer from the surface for the spinners, however, the batters will enjoy batting on the track.

The pitch falling on the slower side played in the favour of the visitors.\n\nUnlike previous games, the destructive opening duo of SRH failed to spread their wings in the powerplay. Will Jacks dismissed Travis Head (1) on the final delivery of the first over.\n\nAbhishek Sharma (31) showed intent but Yash Dayal got the better of the young left-handed opener in the fourth over.\n\nThe middle-order set-up that has backed the opening duo failed to pull SRH out of their distress. The spin duo of Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma made short work of the hosts' middle-order set-up and put RCB in the driver's seat.\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins tried to raise hopes of an unprecedented comeback with his quick-fire 31 off 15 deliveries. Shahbaz Ahmed on the other end continued to wage a lone battle but SRH fell short by 35 runs at the end.\n\nEarlier in the innings, RCB opted to bat first, star batter Virat Kohli and skipper Faf du Plessis made sure to give RCB a strong start with the bat as the opening pair hammered SRH bowlers all around the ground.\n\nCaptain Pat Cummins then brought T Natarajan into the attack and the bowler gave his team a much-needed breakthrough as he dismissed the RCB skipper, Faf du Plessis. A slower bouncer by Natarajan got the better of du Plessis.\n\nMayank Markande was brought into the attack by Cummins, which proved fruitful as he bagged the wicket of Will Jacks, who was never looking stable at the crease.\n\nRajat Patidar with his sensational onslaught over Mayank Markande's third over of the night as he hammered the bowler for 27 runs. The star batter Patidar also brought up his 50-partnership with Kohli while also smashing fifty in 19 balls.\n\nJaydev Unadkat got the big wicket for SRH, as he dismissed the in-form Patidar on the very next ball after completing his fifty.\n\nKohli slammed a resilient fifty within 37 balls, however, the former RCB skipper was dismissed by Unadkat with a power-less shot after scoring 51 runs in 43 deliveries. Unadkat bagged his third wicket of the night in his 100th IPL match, as he dismissed Mahipal Lomror.\n\nAfter losing wickets at regular intervals, RCB was successful in scoring 206/7 in 20 overs.\n\nBrief score: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad 170/8 (Shahbaz Ahmed 40*, Pat Cummins 31; Cameron Green 2-12).

SRH didn't start off well with the ball as Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli took the bowlers to the cleaners.\n\nAfter a flying start, Virat Kohli got significantly slow but Rajat Patidar's 19-ball fifty kept the run rate in check. Kohli was dismissed for 43-ball 51 and Patidar walked back after scoring 20-ball 50. SRH bowlers did well in the middle overs, but they were poor in the death as Cameron Green batted well and along with other batters powered RCB to a total of 206 for 7. Jaydev Unadkat was the top performer for SRH in the bowling department as he bagged 3 wickets for 30 runs in his 100th IPL game.\n\nChasing the target, SRH were off to a nightmarish start as they lost their in-form opener Travis Head in the first over and Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, and Heinrich Klaasen inside the powerplay. The middle-order and lower-order batters of the team tried to take the game deep but they were eventually restricted to 171/8 to hand over RCB a 35-run victory.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Pat Cummins said that they gave away a few extra runs with the ball and were below par with the bat as well. Pat Cummins stated:\n\n\"Not an ideal night. Few over par with the ball and unfortunately lost a few wickets throughout our innings. We were gonna bat first, it seems to be working for us. Before the last few wins, we were thinking that we were a bowl-first team. Didn't go our way.\"\n\nPat Cummins revealed that he speaks to the team after the victories and coach Daniel Vettori does the job after the defeats. Pat Cummins said:\n\n\"(Messaging to the group) I speak after wins, Dan (Vettori) speaks after losses. The boys have been going really well, it's T20 cricket, you are not going to win every game. Don't dwell on this too much.\"\n\nPat Cummins further said that the ultra-aggressive approach of their batting unit is their strong suit and they are not going to win every game with it, but that's the way forward for them. Pat Cummins said:\n\n\"(High risk, high reward approach with the bat) I think it's our strong suit. It's not going to work every game. One or two games where it hasn't gone our way at the start, we still managed to get a good total. Still think this is the way forward for our boys.\"\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad have been a batting dominant team in the Indian Premier League 2024 and they broke Royal Challengers Bengaluru's long-standing record of highest IPL total thrice in their first seven games.\n\nSRH batters have been absolutely fearless and they have done the heavy lifting to compensate for their bowling deficiencies. Before the match against RCB, SRH registered scores of 208/7, 277/3, 162/8, 165/5, 182/9, 287/3 and 266/7 in their first seven matches.\n\nIn those matches, SRH bowlers were underwhelming on most occasions as the one-time IPL champions conceded the following scores - 208/7, 246/5, 168/3, 166/4, 180/6, 262/7 and 199 - against Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Gujarat Titans, Chennai Super

The stage is set at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, promising an enthralling spectacle for cricket enthusiasts.\n\nThe previous encounter between these two powerhouses witnessed a spectacular display of batting prowess by SRH, as they amassed a colossal 287 runs, setting a new record for the highest team total in IPL history. Riding on the back of their red-hot form, SRH's batsmen are expected to continue their onslaught against the RCB bowling attack.\n\nWith just one win from eight games, RCB finds themselves in a precarious position, needing to win all remaining six matches to keep their playoff hopes alive. Though the odds seem daunting, mathematical possibilities still exist for RCB, provided they deliver stellar performances and receive favorable outcomes in other matches.\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has been a batting-friendly surface in IPL 2024, as evidenced by the two matches played there so far. Batsmen have enjoyed good bounce and carry, allowing them to play their shots freely. The outfield has been fast, enabling value for shots. However, bowlers have found success by employing variations effectively. Given the conditions, both teams will likely aim for a high-scoring encounter, with bowlers needing to rely on their skills to contain the opposition.\n\nLooking back at their recent encounters, SRH holds a slight edge over RCB, clinching victory in the most recent match by a margin of 25 runs.

The home team are looking to win the game and go to the 2 spot on the table and also knock out RCB from the prized tournament.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru went in with the same team that had lost to KKR by 1 run. Sunrisers Hyderabad on the other hand brought in Jaydev Unadkat for Washington Sundar as the only change from the previous game versus Delhi Capitals.\n\nAlso Check: Glenn Maxwell and Washington Sundar skip match 41 between SRH vs RCB: Reasons Explained\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad were given taste of their own medicine when the RCB openers gave a blistering start. Just when it seemed that the game was going away from his grasp, Pat Cummins got T Natarajan who dismissed Faf Du Plessis for 25.\n\nAfter getting a good start, the wicket of Faf Du Plessis seemed to have pegged back the RCB batters. Virat Kohli played a few food shots to show what good form he has been in, as the RCB batters would want to put a huge score on the board.\n\nThe introduction of spin seemed to slow down the frenetic scoring from the RCB batting unit. Shahbaz Ahmed got the big wicket of Will Jacks as he was bowled just six runs. Rajat Patidar began well as he hit a few crisp shots to set the tone.\n\nOnce the break was over, Rajat Patidar went on the offensive. Mayank Markande was hit for four sixes in four balls as RCB signalled their intentions to the SRH bowlers.\n\nRCB fans were happy to see Rajat Patidar get back to his best. The last few games has seen the 30-year-old show glimpses of his old form with the bat as he struck his 5 IPL fifty.\n\nThe former RCB skipper Virat Kohli has been the only batter who has been consistent during the IPL 2024 season. The 35-year-old began with his trademark wristy shots before settling down to score his 53 fifty in the tournament.\n\nAlso Check: IPL 2024: Viewership records shattered as broadcaster clocks nearly 50 crore hits\n\nThe capacity crowd in Hyderabad saw Rajat Patidar flay the bowlers to all parts of the stadium. Jaydev Unadkat who is playing his 100 game in the IPL got the wicket before Virat Kohli was joined by Cameron Green.\n\nJaydev Unadkat dealt RCB a huge blow when he had Virat Kohli caught by Abdul Samad for 51 with a slower bouncer. Cameron Green hit Pat Cummins for two fours to take the score past 150 with 4 fours overs left to play.\n\nSwapnil Singh who came in as the Impact player hit T Natarajan for a huge six to reach the 200 on the first ball of the 19 over. This was Bengaluru's third consecutive 200+ total in the ongoing season.\n\nBowling for the first time, SRH seemed to have lost the plot with the ball early. Unadkat though brought the home team back into the game with a brilliant spell (3/30 from 4 overs).", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Sundar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Sundar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Dinesh Karthik, Heinrich Klaasen (c), Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, Travis Head, Rajat Patidar, Abhishek Sharma, Will Jacks (vc), K Nitish Reddy, Pat Cummins, T Natarajan\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad have adopted an aggressive style of play right from the start and it has paid high dividends for them as they collected 10 points from 7 matches this season so far and sit 3rd in the standings with 10 points. Openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma are in resounding form and provided stunning starts which is the major reason behind their successful campaign. They posted 266 runs in their latest fixture against Delhi, their 3rd 250-plus score this season, and comfortably won the game by 67 runs. When batters are doing the heavy lifting, T Natarajan shined with the ball, picking up 10 wickets in his last 5 appearances and the clever thinking of Pat Cummins earned him 9 wickets.\n\nThey previously belted RCB for a record-breaking 287 runs and aiming to repeat a similar performance this time. Sunrisers have won their previous four matches and are keen to extend the winning momentum.\n\nScoring 221 and 262 in the last two outings against Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers, didn't fetch wins for Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Faf du Plessis and company are enduring a six-match losing streak before heading into this match, their fifth away clash this year. Bowling has flopped once again which shows their poor set of strategies in the auction. Glenn Maxwell who took a break due to mental health is in contention for a comeback and might replace Cameron Green.\n\nThey form a formidable batting attack having the likes of Will Jacks, Faf du Plessis, Dinesh Karthik, Virat Kohli, and Rajat Patidar.

Unadkat comes in for Washington Sundar,\" said Cummins at the toss.\n\nSRH have been in stellar form this season and stand in the third position with five wins and 10 points after seven matches.\n\nALSO READ: Pakistan's Bismah Maroof Announces Retirement From International Cricket\n\nOn the other hand, RCB are placed at the bottom of the table, having won just one match in their eight matches so far.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad Playing XI: Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Nitish Reddy, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan\n\nSRH Impact Subs: Travis Head, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips, Washington Sundar\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru Playing XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis(c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik(w), Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Siraj, Yash Dayal\n\nRCB Impact Subs: Suyash Prabhudessai, Anuj Rawat, Himanshu Sharma, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Swapnil Singh", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Sundar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Sundar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijaykumar_Vyshak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijaykumar Vyshak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

After scoring 206/7, RCB restricted the free-scoring SRH to 171/8.\n\nSRH's chances of winning the game looked all but over inside the powerplay after they lost four wickets. Will Jacks gave RCB a huge breakthrough by dismissing the in-form Travis Head for just three runs in the very first over.\n\nAbhishek Sharma continued his fine run and raced away to 31 runs off just 12 balls before Yash Dayal dismissed him in the fourth over. In the fifth over, Swapnil Singh dismissed Aiden Markram (7) and Heinrich Klaasen (7) to leave SRH reeling at 56 for 4.\n\nKarn Sharma joined the party soon by dismissing Nitish Reddy (13) and Abdul Samad (10) to reduce SRH to 85 for 6. Captain Pat Cummins revived his team's slim chances for a while but could not last long and departed after scoring 31 runs off just 15 balls.\n\nSRH just could not stay in contention after the early setbacks and eventually finished on 171 for 8. Shahbaz Ahmed top scored for SRH, scoring an unbeaten 40 to help his side finish with a respectable total.\n\nEarlier in the game, RCB scored 206/7 in the allotted 20 overs after their captain Faf du Plessis won the toss and opted to bat first. Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar led RCB's charge with the bat by scoring half-centuries. For SRH, Jaydev Unadkat picked up three wickets while T Natarajan claimed two.\n\nRCB were off to a good start with Kohli and Faf du Plessis adding 48 runs in just 23 balls. Natarajan broke the stand by dismissing du Plessis for 25 to give SRH the crucial first breakthrough. Du Plessis' dismissal slowed down the flow of runs for RCB. In the last two overs of the powerplay, Kohli and Will Jacks could score only 12 runs.\n\nIn the seventh over, Mayank Markande put RCB under more pressure by dismissing Jacks for 6. With RCB reeling at 65 for 2 after seven overs, SRH were firmly in command of the proceedings. However, Rajat Patidar came up with a whirlwind knock to put his team in the driver's seat again. He scored a 19-ball fifty with the help of two fours and five sixes before being dismissed by Unadkat in the 13th over.\n\nKohli completed his fifty off 37 balls in the 14th over before Unadkat dismissed him for 51 in the 15th over. In the final overs, Cameron Green led RCB's charge with the bat, by scoring an unbeaten 37 off 20 balls.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Dayal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yash Dayal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

It's a contest between two teams that find themselves in contrasting positions on the points table. While SRH have played a brand of cricket that has captured everyone's attention and have breached the 250-run mark thrice in this edition of the tournament alone, it's a philosophy that has augured well for the team.\n\nIPL 2024 SRH vs RCB Live Score, Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru: The Orange Army has so far played 7 matches and have registered wins in 5 of them. In two matches, they have had to stumble defeat. In sharp contrast, RCB haven't found a way that has been working for them as they haven't quite got the desired results. In 8 matches, they only have a win against their name and as many as 7 defeats. Their miserable season finds them at the rock bottom of the IPL 2024 points table.\n\nAs far as the SRH vs RCB head-to-head record is concerned, it is tilted in favour of SRH but only just. The two teams have locked horns a total of 25 times with SRH winning 13 matches (including a tied game) and RCB coming out on top on the other 12 occasions. In their faceoff earlier in the season too, it was SRH who had the last laugh having beaten RCB by 25 runs at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium as Hyderabad made 287/3, the highest total ever made in the history of the tournament.\n\nWill it be a similar story this time around or will RCB bowlers come up with a batter plan and their batters click as a unit in this game?

A whopping 549 runs were scored by both the teams--the highest match aggregated in any T20 match, the last time these two sides met this season. Sunrisers Hyderabad did manage to come out on top in the end, but not without some resistance from RCB, with Dinesh Karthik showing that he still had it in him to compete at the highest level. On form, Sunrisers Hyderabad are outright favourites to walk away with a win in this match. The Pat Cummins-led outfit has been one of the most dominant this season and have established themselves as early contenders for the title.

With only one win in eight matches, Faf du Plessis and co. are staring at an early elimination from the competition. It is now or never for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who, too, have some amazing hitters in their ranks. But their bowling has been the weak link, and it remains to be seen how they manage to restrict the SRH batters in this match. A win for RCB, by a good margin, can help them scale higher up the points table and move to the ninth spot from the 10th place. Sunrisers Hyderabad, on the other hand, will topple KKR and move to second place if they win tonight!

RCB won the match by 35 runs after the Hyderabad batting lineup had an uncharacteristic bad day in the office while chasing 207 runs to win. Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar hit fifties for RCB while Cameron Green provided a late flourish with his 20-ball 37 to help them post 205 runs in their 20 overs.\n\nThe SRH chase fell apart in the very first over as Will Jacks dismissed the dangerous Travis Head. Abhishek Sharma would give them some acceleration before he was dismissed for 31 off 13 balls. Swapnil Singh would then turn the game on its head with the big wickets of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen. Karn Sharma would weave his magic as well, by dismissing Nitish Kumar Reddy and Abdul Samad.\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins and Shahbaz Ahmed did their best to keep Hyderabad in the hunt but Green would dismiss Cummins to all but end the hopes of the Orange Army. Shahbaz scored a valiant 40 but the SRH innings came to a halt at 171 for 8 in 20 overs. With the win, RCB ended their 6-match losing streak.\n\nThe target of 207 seemed to be light work given the reputation SRH had built this season. The likes of Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen have sort of inspired the rest to go after the bowlers and intimidate them with their big-hitting. In the reverse fixture against RCB, they broke their own record for the highest total in IPL history.\n\nHowever, trying to live up to this reputation would come to haunt Hyderabad infront of their home crowd on Thursday. Head fell early to a nothing shot and Abhishek would also depart trying to up the ante when it wasn't necessary. The same could be said about Heinrich Klaasen as well, who had hit a six off the previous delivery before handing RCB a 4th wicket in the powerplay.\n\nCummins would provide some entertainment to the crowd, but that was about it for SRH today in terms of their batting. This was the 13th time SRH were chasing a 200-plus target in their IPL history and they have only managed to get over the line once. Even earlier in the season, they lost to KKR in a thriller and now teams would feel that the best thing to do is put them under pressure by making them chase.\n\nAs for RCB, the plus point was certainly their spinners Swapnil Singh and Karn Sharma, who picked up two wickets each. Cameron Green's all-round performance will also be a big win for the team management as they keep their playoff hopes alive.\n\nSRH vs RCB: Updates | Scorecard\n\nVirat Kohli may continue rule the roost when it comes to the Orange Cap standings, but the RCB star needs to reassess his plan when it comes to switching the gears. Even when he scored a fine hundred against RR, the consensus was that the innings was slow, and he didn't capitalise on the platform they had got that day.\n\nThe same happened today as well as RCB had gotten off the blocks very quickly with Faf du Plessis and scoring 48 within the first 4 overs. Kohli also was looking to be in good nick as he had got to 32 off 18 balls. However, he could only manage 19 off the next 25 balls and his innings would end at 51 from 43 deliveries. If not for the Rajat Patidar knock, RCB could have found themselves in trouble as Kohli got stuck in third gear and struggled to even find a boundary.\n\nIPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nThe critics on social media weren't kind to the RCB star and Sunil Gavaskar was also critical about his performance. The Indian legend said that RCB expects the star batter to not scoring at a strike-rate of 118. Kohli has shown this season that he can go aggressively during the powerplay overs, but that now needs to extend to the rest of the innings as well.\n\nWith the T20 World Cup just around the corner and with Kohli expected to be in the side, for the big picture, the star batter needs to now look at a smoother transition when it comes to taking the attack to the opposition bowlers.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202404/srh-vs-rcb-252647745-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=EkfRuurNMew2xT_gDS6i9NEOJ2ZM_rce", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 203, "textEnd": 211}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Kohli and Cummins were spotted catching up with each other during the two teams' training at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nKohli was sitting padded up on the ground when Cummins approached him and the duo shared a light-hearted conversation. The SRH skipper too was padded up and seemed to have come to Kohli after a batting session in the nets. Cummins boasted about his batting and told Kohli how the coach was saying that he was making the wicket look flat.\n\nIn the video shared by RCB on their social media handles, the duo shared a laugh before Kohli told Cummins how good he was. Here's how the conversation went:\n\n\"The coach was saying I was making that wicket look flat. That's all I heard,\" said Cummins.\n\nKohli will be up against Cummins for the second time this season as the RCB star looks to get back among the runs for his team. In the last meeting between RCB and SRH, Kohli scored 42 runs as RCB lost by 25 runs after conceding a whopping 287 runs during SRH's innings at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.\n\nSRH rode on Travis Head's sensational ton and Heinrich Klaasen's quickfire 67 off 31 balls to shatter their own record for the highest total in IPL history with 287 runs on the board. In reply, RCB produced a good fight as they managed to post 262/7 and lost by only 25 runs in the chase.\n\nWith just 1 win in 8 matches so far this season, RCB are currently lying at the bottom of the IPL 2024 points table. Faf du Plessis & Co. are on a losing streak of six matches and will be hoping to end it against in-form SRH.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_kumar@news9live.com", "name": "Abhishek Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chinnaswamy_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M.

However, standout performer Virat Kohli leads the run-scoring charts with 379 runs, including one century and two fifties.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has been a revelation in this IPL, with explosive batting displays from Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma. Under the leadership of Pat Cummins, SRH achieved the highest-ever score in IPL history, posting 287 runs while batting first.\n\nAs the two teams gear up for an upcoming high-octane clash in Hyderabad, Kohli and Cummins were seen engaging in jovial banter. A video capturing their interaction has started to surface on social media.\n\nDuring the pre-match practice session before the encounter between SRH and RCB, Cummins approached Kohli, mentioning that he had heard Kohli accuse him of preparing flat wickets. In response, Kohli remarked that the SRH skipper is exceptionally talented.\n\nThe team captained by Faf du Plessis is teetering on the brink of elimination from the race to the playoffs. To secure a spot in the top four, RCB requires victories in all its remaining matches.

SRH are third in the points table with five wins in seven matches and have a chance to climb to second place. On the other hand, RCB have lost six matches on the trot and to even mathematically have a chance to making it to top four, they need to win all their remaining six matches.

They smashed 277 runs against Mumbai Indians and won it comfortably by 31 runs. In the next game at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, the home side won chasing a relatively modest total of 179 runs.

His team did just that by posting a big total and taking early wickets to win the match.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru rode on contrasting half-centuries by Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar and a brilliant all-round performance by Cameron Green, who scored an unbeaten 37 and claimed 2-12, to hand Sunrisers Hyderabad a 35-run defeat and registered their first win after six successive defeats in IPL 2024.\n\nLeg-spinner Karn Sharma (2-29) and Swapnil Singh (2-40) too claimed a double each on top of a superb bowling effort as SRH were restricted to 171/8 in 20 overs after a 37-ball fifty by Kohli and a blazing 19-ball half-century by Patidar propelled them to a challenging 206/7 after du Plessis chose to bat first on winning the toss.\n\nConsidering that SRH has scored two of the biggest totals this season, it was a chasable target for them but they failed to gain any momentum and slumped to their third defeat of IPL and remain in third position. RCB have now won their second match but remain at the bottom.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad virtually lost the match in the Power-play as they suffered four setbacks -- none more debilitating than the wicket of opener Travis Head for one run in the first over.\n\nDu Plessis, who had boldly decided to bat first against an in-form SRH, continued with his fearless approach by opening the bowling with off-spinner Will Jacks. The move paid off as the 25-year-old Englishman struck gold on the last ball of the opening over when Head, who came in as an Impact Substitute, tried to hit him out of the park only to see the ball spin away and the top edge going straight to Karn Sharma on the off-side.\n\nFellow opener Abhishek Sharma, who has a strike rate of 200-plus just like Travis Head, hammered a 13-ball 31 studded with three boundaries and two sixes before he fell to Yash Dayal, attempting a pull but mishitting it and lobbing a slice in the air for keeper Dinesh Karthik to pouch a skier.\n\nIt became 41/3 in the fifth over when Markram completely missed a Swapnil Singh delivery to be trapped LBW for seven. And when a few deliveries later Klassen, after hitting Swapnil for a six, was out for seven off 3 balls, SRH slumped to 56/4 in the fifth over and their chase of 207 was in disarray. They ended the Power-play at 62/4, as compared to RCB's 61/1 but the three extra wickets proved a huge stumbling block.\n\nThe dangerous Nitish Kumar Reddy was castled by Karn Sharma playing an ugly switch hit despite the difficult situation his team was in as SRH slumped to 69/5. Abdul Samad (10), who greeted Lockie Ferguson with a swat over long-on off his first delivery, chipped back to Karn, totally foxed by the leg spinner as he jumped out even before the ball was released.\n\nPat Cummins raised SRH hopes by hammering Swapnil Singh for back-to-back sixes in the 11th over and blasted Karn Sharma for a four and six off successive deliveries in the next over, fell to fellow Aussie Cameron Green, trying to hit a short, wide delivery to Mohd Siraj at short third man, beaten by lack of pace in the delivery.\n\nHe blazed to 31 off 15 balls, hitting one four and three sixes. SRH were 124/7 and the writing was clear on the wall. Green claimed one more wicket, sending back Bhuvneshwar Singh (13) as the run rate kept rising and SRH kept losing wickets.\n\nEarlier, Patidar hammered a blazing fifty, his second in successive matches and Kohli scored his fourth half-century at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium as RCB recovered from a decelerating scoring rate after the Power-play to post a big total.\n\nKohli scored his fifty off 37 balls while Patidar hammered his half-century off just 19 balls as RCB posted another 200-plus score after skipper Faf du Plessis opted to bat first on a dual-paced pitch on which the slower one was quite effective.\n\nPatidar blasted four sixes in an over off Mayank Markande to shore up the RCB scoring rate after Kohli struggled to break free. Jaydev Unadkat applied the brakes on the free-scoring RCB innings by claiming the key wickets of Patidar, Kohli and Mahipal Lomror for a fine haul of 3-30 off four overs in his 100th outing in IPL.\n\nEarlier, skipper du Plessis (25) struck Bhuvneshwar Kumar for three boundaries in the second over, the pick of them being a four crashed through the covers off a fullish delivery outside the off stump. In the next over, he welcomed Pat Cummins with a superb six, scooping behind a delivery picked from around off-stump and planting him over the leg-side for the first six of the match. But the introduction of T. Natarajan brought his downfall when he holed out near the deep cover boundary trying to maintain the RCB scoring tempo in Power-play.\n\nRCB raced to 61/1 in Power-play, Will Jacks was out for six after he played all over a slower one from spinner Mayank Markande to make it 65/2. Though Kohli's strike rate went down, Patidar made for that with some brilliant strokes. Kohli, who started with a four off Abhishek Sharma's first delivery, struck back-to-back fours off Pat Cummins and struck a four and six off Natarajan in between singles. He went on to complete a slow half-century off 37 deliveries, hitting four boundaries and one six. This was his fourth successive half-century at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium.\n\nPatidar more than made up for the slow going from Kohli with a blazing half-century off 19 deliveries. The highlight of Patidar's sensational knock was the four sixes he blasted off successive deliveries against Markande, lofting, clobbering and pulling the leg-spinner as the over cost SRH 27 runs.\n\nKohli and Patidar raised 65 runs for the third wicket partnership with the latter doing the bulk of scoring. The half-century of their partnership came in 23 balls with Patidar scoring 45 off them.\n\nHowever, SRH pulled things back a bit after Patidar fell by the sword, trying to play another big one but managed to flick the slow full toss from Jaydev Unadkat into the hands of Abdul Samad at deep square leg. Patidar's 20-ball 50 was studded with two boundaries and five maximums.\n\nKohli completed his half-century off 37 balls, but Unadkat got him in the next over, getting him to hole out to Samad as the former RCB skipper failed to break free from the shackles. Mahipal Lomror was out cheaply but Cameron Green played a fine cameo and with the help of Dinesh Karthik (11 off 6) helped RCB reach a defendable total. Swapnil Singh struck a boundary and a six off the first two balls of the final over to help them cross the 200-run mark.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50, Cameron Green 37 not out; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30, T.Natarajan 2-39) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad 171/8 in 20 overs (Shahbaz Ahmed 40 not out, Abhishek Sharma 31, Pat Cummins 31; Cameron

Establishing a strong foundation was crucial to maintaining scoreboard pressure on the SRH batsmen for the second innings.\n\nWhile du Plessis departed after a quick 12-ball 25, Rajat Patidar stepped up and played aggressively. Patidar's half-century off just 20 balls boosted RCB's scoring rate and provided a break for Virat Kohli in the middle overs.\n\nHowever, Kohli's innings (51) lost momentum thereafter, and he was dismissed by Jaydev Unadkat.\n\nCameron Green and impact player Swapnil Singh then took charge, propelling RCB to a competitive total of 206/7 by the end of their 20 overs.\n\nIn reply, it was as if RCB had planned this match accordingly. SRH big hitters Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma failed to fire their side to yet another big score in the powerplay as both batters saw themselves dismissed at a collective total of just 32 with Head departing for just 1 run courtesy of a Will Jacks delivery.\n\nPat Cummins and Abhishek Sharma's 31-run knock each eventually turned out to be the top score on the night as Hyderabad got crushed by the scoreboard pressure and saw their batting order decimated on the night.\n\nSwapnil Singh and Karn Sharma took 2 wickets each on the night and helped restrict SRH to just 171/8 in the end. Royal Challengers Bengaluru's 2nd win of the tournament couldn't lift them in the table but gave them confidence that they can revive their season by winning a couple of more matches on the trot.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashwat_nishant@news24online.com", "name": "Shashwat Nishant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRH-vs-RCB-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 253, "textEnd": 261}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

After winning the toss and opting to bat first, Bengaluru managed to post 206/7, riding on a 43-ball 51 and a half-century from Rajat Patidar.

it was Jaydev Unadkat who shone with the ball, as he scalped both crucial batters and Mahipal Lomror in quick intervals to consistently pile the pressure on the visitors.\n\nBut, thanks to a cameo from Cameron Green, RCB mustered 206 runs in 20 overs, to put up what could be a fair total against a fiery SRH batting lineup.\n\nTo everyone's dismay, the unexpected would unfold for SRH though, as Bengaluru wreaked havoc with the new ball out the gate.\n\nWill Jacks started the onslaught, as he scalped Travis Head in the very first over, to set the tone.\n\nThen, the likes of Yash Dayal and most importantly, Swapnil Singh followed suit as the top order of SRH, except for Abhishek Sharma, crumbled, and the hosts were poised at 56-4 within the fifth over.\n\nJust when it seemed that SRH may be spared of any more misery, RCB's ace in the hole came out in the form of Karn Sharma.\n\nKarn bowled a magical spell, scalping two more wickets, in his first two overs, to push SRH to an abysmal 85-6.\n\nSRH's never-say-die attitude shone through next as skipper Pat Cummins came out to bat and packed a wallop, dealing only in boundaries as he took some of the pressure off Shahbaz at the other end.\n\nCummins put up a swashbuckling 31 runs in just 15 balls, before he was caught lacking by Cameron Green off a shorter and slower delivery, to sky one high and provide an easy catch.\n\nThis proved to be the nail in the coffin for Hyderabad, who despite Shahbaz Ahmed's best efforts, produced too little too late as RCB clinched a 35-run win, only the second of their season so far.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki",

After starting the season with a narrow defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders, the Sunrisers have won five out of six matches and are among the early contenders for the playoffs.\n\nA win for Hyderabad will help them move past KKR to the second spot on the points table.\n\nRCB, meanwhile, are on the verge of bowing out of the playoffs race after losing seven out of eight games this season -- their only victory coming against Punjab Kings at home. Though they will likely remain mathematically alive, a defeat on Thursday will practically end their hopes of sneaking through to the knockouts.\n\nSquads:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abdul Samad, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan, Washington Sundar, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Akash Maharaj Singh, Glenn Phillips, Mayank Agarwal, Jaydev Unadkat, Rahul Tripathi, Upendra Yadav, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis(c), Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Cameron Green, Dinesh Karthik(w), Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Siraj, Suyash Prabhudessai, Anuj Rawat, Himanshu Sharma, Swapnil Singh, Glenn Maxwell, Reece Topley, Tom Curran, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Mayank Dagar, Alzarri Joseph, Manoj Bhandage, Akash Deep, Saurav Chauhan, Rajan Kumar.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoj_Bhandage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manoj Bhandage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijaykumar_Vyshak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijaykumar Vyshak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazalhaq_Farooqi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fazalhaq Farooqi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umran_Malik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umran Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

On the eve of the match, in a joint training session in Hyderabad, SRH captain Pat Cummins walked up to RCB icon Virat Kohli for a healthy banter.\n\nIn a viral video, Kohli was seen sitting on the ground when Cummins, all padded up, approached the former for a chat.\n\n\"The coach was saying I was making that wicket look flat. That's all I heard,\" Cummins can be heard as saying to Kohli.\n\nVirat had a wry smile on his face as he replied: \"You are too good, Pat\".\n\nThe interaction between the two has gone viral on social media.\n\nAhead of the match, Cummins opened up on his admiration for Kohli and his best favourite memory of the star batter.\n\n\"My favourite memory of Virat Kohli, can I say whenever I get him out? (Laughs) I admire him a lot, he's always in the game whether batting or bowling. He's super competitive,\" Cummins said on Star Sports.\n\nThe last time SRH faced RCB, it turned out to be a run fest.\n\nBatting first, SRH posted the biggest-ever IPL total, 287/3, going past the previous mark of 277 they made earlier during the season against Mumbai Indians.\n\nThe match produced the highest aggregate for a T20 game with a tally of 549 runs as RCB hit 262 while chasing.\n\nKohli has been getting the majority of runs for RCB this season despite their struggles.

Then, left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh dismissed Aiden Markram, trapping him LBW with a full-toss.\n\nRCB was back on top again as Heinrich Klaasen, who hit the previous ball from Swapnil for a six over long-on, perished trying to repeat the stroke.\n\nLater, leg-spinner Karn Sharma had Nitish Kumar Reddy bowled, missing a reverse sweep and then took a smart return catch to send back the dangerous Abdul Samad to reduce SRH to 85 for six in 9.1 overs.\n\nThe rest was a formality as RCB notched up a much-awaited win.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS - RCB vs SRH\n\nEarlier, Rajat Patidar's brilliance at the top of the order, a not-so-fluent half-century by Virat Kohli and a cameo by Cameron Green helped RCB, electing to bat, post a challenging total.\n\nStrangely, after the power-play, Kohli struggled to find his desired form and failed to score a boundary.\n\nHowever, Patidar was just brilliant at the other end, with a 20-ball half-century, hitting leg-spinner Mayank Markande for four huge sixes in the 11th over of the innings.\n\nJaydev Unadkat was the pick of the bowlers with his three-wicket haul, including the prize scalps of Patidar and Kohli, slowing down the pace of the game.\n\nRCB scored 64 runs from the last five overs, losing three wickets thanks mainly to some lusty blows by Green.\n\nLatest on SportstarSRH vs RCB Highlights, IPL 2024: Royal Challengers Bengaluru beats Sunrisers Hyderabad by 35 runsTeam SportstarSRH vs RCB, IPL 2024: Royal Challengers Bengaluru thumps Sunrisers Hyderabad to end losing streakV.

Rajat Patidar's explosive 50 and the spinners' efforts secured the win. RCB scored 206/7, with Patidar and Virat Kohli contributing. Despite a strong SRH batting lineup, the spinners restricted them to 171/8. Patidar's sixes and Kohli's measured approach played a crucial role. The win was a setback for SRH, who lost their third match.\n\nRajat Patidar's explosive fifty and a collective effort from the spinners set up Royal Challengers Bengaluru's 35-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL here on Thursday, bringing an end to their six-match losing streak. Patidar's 50 off 20 balls stood in stark contrast to Virat Kohli's measured 51 off 43 balls as RCB put up 206 for seven after opting to bat.\n\nFor a team that has breached the 250-run mark thrice season, the target was very gettable but the in-form SRH batting line-up could not deliver on this occasion and ended at 171 for eight in 20 overs.\n\nIt was a much-needed result for RCB, who lost seven of their first eight games. The loss was SRH's third in eight matches.\n\nConsidering the effectiveness of the spinners in the first innings, RCB opened the bowling with part-time off-spinner Will Jacks. The English man had the destructive Travis Head (1 off 3) caught at third man to give RCB a massive boost.\n\nHead's opening partner Abhishek Sharma (31 off 13) did entertain the home crowd until his attempted slog ended up in the hands of wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Swapnil Singh, making his RCB debut, struck twice in his first over removing the dangerous South Africa duo of Aiden Markram and Henrich Klaasen. While Markram missed a full toss to be adjudged lbw, Klaasen was caught at mid-on after mistiming a lofted drive, leaving SRH at 56 for four in five overs.\n\nLeggie Karn Sharma then dismissed Nitish Reddy and Abdul Samad to shut the door on the opposition.\n\nEarlier, Patidar did the bulk of the work in his 65-run stand with Kohli who was focused on giving the strike to his partner, an approach which was questioned by Sunil Gavaskar on air.\n\nCameron Green (37 not out off 20) and Swapnil Singh (12 off 6) came up with timely strikes in the death overs to take RCB past 200. RCB were all guns blazing in the first three overs with Kohli and Faf du Plessis (25 off 12) going hard at the SRH bowlers, including opposition skipper Pat Cummins who conceded 19 runs in his first over.\n\nHowever, from 43 for no loss of the first 18 balls, RCB could only reach 61 for 1 by the end of the powerplay. Du Plessis was deceived by a slow short ball from T Natarajan to be caught by Aiden Markram at mid-off. Will Jacks (6 off 9) went for a wild slog sweep off a flighted delivery from leg-spinner Mayank Markande but could not make contact to be bowled, leaving RCB 65 for two in seven overs.\n\nThat was when Kohli and Patidar got together to take the innings forward.\n\nThe spinners were able to put pressure on the batters after the powerplay. As Kohli went for rotation of strike in this tough phase for RCB, Patidar broke the shackles by smashing Markande for four straight sixes in the 11th over. The first two hits were down the ground before Patidar read Markande''s googly to send it over mid-wicket. The fourth and final six came off a wide and loopy delivery which Patidar dispatched over extra cover.\n\nSuch was the contrast in the style of approaches that Patidar took 19 balls to reach his fifty, while IPL''s leading run-getter Kohli took 37.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Jaydev Unadkat has replaced Sundar in the XI.\n\nThe only change came as Sundar failed to deliver with the ball for SRH against Gujarat Titans (GT) and Delhi Capitals (DC), managing a solitary wicket in his first two games of IPL 2024. The off-spinner was hit for 30 runs off an over by Jake Fraser-McGurk in the previous game against DC.\n\nAt the toss, SRH captain Pat Cummins said that they would like to improve their bowling after giving away runs at 10-plus runs per over in the last few games:\n\n\"We want to bat the same way. We have to adjust quicker as a bowling side. Unadkat comes in for Washington Sundar.\"\n\nUnadkat has scalped four wickets in five matches for Sunrisers this season so far. The left-arm pacer, though, has bowled an economy rate of 11.35. The 32-year-old, however, has scalped 14 wickets in eight IPL games in Hyderabad. He also has eight wickets in 12 games against RCB.\n\nRCB opt to bat against SRH in IPL 2024 match\n\nRCB captain Faf du Plessis won the toss and elected to bat first against SRH in IPL on Thursday.

These boys (SRH) have been playing some amazing cricket, especially batting. Hopefully, we can put some scoreboard pressure on them. They've been batting well when they've been setting scores.\"\n\nDu Plessis also backed his team to return to winning ways after a fighting display against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), where they lost by just one run while chasing 223. He continued:\n\n\"I was proud with the way we played the previous game. We fought hard with the ball in hand. Two games in a row now, we've put some really good scores.

In their first match of the season, both teams scored more than 500 runs, only the second time in IPL history.", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Agarwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Agarwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Tripathi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Tripathi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2024/Apr/Capture_662a1f793ed3c.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Exactly a month after their last win, RCB forced their hosts to veer away from their recent template by asking them to chase a strong total of 206 on a two-paced track courtesy blazing knocks from Rajat Patidar (50 off 20) and Cameron Green (37* off 20) before their spinners stepped up to take four crucial wickets in an eventual 35-run victory.\n\nThe difference: Unfamiliar PowerPlay territory\n\nFor the first time this season, RCB took four or more wickets in the PowerPlay and the first time SRH lost as many wickets in the phase. Those wickets, of Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen proved to be the difference even though SRH scored one more run in the PowerPlay.\n\n- RCB SRH Score 61/1 62/4 Run-Rate 10.16 10.33 4s/6s 7/2 4/4\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru\n\nPowerPlay: A tug and a counter-tug\n\nRCB 61/1 [RR: 10.16, 4s/6s: 7/2]\n\nVirat Kohli and Faf du Plessis raced off the blocks to 43/0 in 3 overs after RCB won the toss. The first ball of the fourth over, bowled by T. Natarajan, was flicked for four by Kohli. The next 11 balls of the PowerPlay fetched just 4 runs as Natarajan dismissed du Plessis (25 off 12) with a slower short-ball before Shahbaz Ahmed bowled a two-run first over. Kohli found a six as Natarajan became the only SRH bowler to get a second PowerPlay over to give the visitors 61/1 after six overs.\n\nMiddle Overs: Kohli's go-slow, Patidar's blitz and Unadkat's wickets\n\nRCB 81/3 [RR: 9.00, 4s/6s: 2/5]\n\nKohli began the post-PowerPlay phase batting on 32 off 18. He was eventually dismissed for a 43-ball 51 having hit only 19 runs from his final 25 balls at a strike-rate of 76, scoring no boundaries against the spread out field. He also made just a run-a-ball 14 in a partnership of 65 off 34 balls. His partner, Rajat Patidar, scored a 19-ball half-century, hitting four of his five sixes in a row in the 11th over bowled by Mayank Markande. But on a pitch that was gripping and stopping, SRH fought back again by bowling overs 12-15 without conceding a four. Jaydev Unadkat was the pick of the hosts' bowlers, his slower ones, into-the-wicket deliveries making shot-making difficult. Playing his 100th IPL game, Unadkat dismissed Patidar, Kohli and Mahipal Lomror.\n\nDeath Overs: Green plays the slower ball well\n\nRCB 64/3 [RR: 12.8, 4s/6s: 9/1]\n\nGreen was the best of RCB's batters against the slower deliveries. He hit four of his five boundaries against compatriot Pat Cummins, whose four overs cost 55. The SRH captain, however, was excellent with his use of bowlers with Shahbaz's three overs for 14 runs covered up excellently for Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who bowled just one over.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad\n\nPowerPlay: A rare top-order collapse for SRH\n\nSRH 62/4 [RR: 10.33, 4s/6s: 4/4]\n\nWill Jacks opened the bowling in the corresponding fixture in Bengaluru but the match-up play didn't pay any dividends then. But today it did. The final ball of the first over gripped a touch but it was the length that did for Travis Head, who miscued a slog to backward point. Jacks' second over went for 20 but once Yash Dayal had Abhishek Sharma miscuing a loft to fall for a 13-ball 31, RCB were on top. Swapnil Singh gave away 19 in his first over but struck twice to dismiss the big-hitting Protea pair of Markram and Klaasen as SRH were reduced to 62/4 after six overs.\n\nMiddle Overs: Karn Sharma flies the spin flag for RCB\n\nSRH 70/3 [RR: 7.77, 4s/6s: 3/4]\n\nStraight after the PowerPlay, Karn Sharma struck in his first and second overs to leave SRH reeling at 85/6. First he castled Nitish Reddy, who missed an attempted reverse sweep. Abdul Samad then was beaten by the length after stepping down the pitch and chipping a simple return catch. Cummins sparked a mini-revival by slogging Swapnil for a pair of sixes and then hit his first two balls of the next, bowled by Karn, for a four and a six. The SRH skipper eventually fell to Green, slicing an attempted slash towards point. Karn, though, bowled out with excellent figures of 2 for 29.\n\nDeath Overs: An insipid finish\n\nSRH 39/1 [RR: 7.8, 4s/6s: 3/1]\n\nThe final chapter of this game had a ceremonial feel to it with the game having gone well past SRH by then. Green added a second wicket, that off Bhuvneshwar Kumar, but SRH's ninth wicket pair hung on to reduce the final margin of defeat to 35 runs.\n\nBrief scores:Royal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad 171/8 in 20 overs (Shahbaz Ahmed 40*; Karn Sharma 2-29) by 35 runs\n\nWhat next for the teams?\n\nRCB have a short turnaround before their Sunday afternoon fixture away to the Gujarat Titans.

The loss was SRH's third in eight matches.\n\nConsidering the effectiveness of the spinners in the first innings, RCB opened the bowling with part-time off-spinner Will Jacks. The English man had the destructive Travis Head (1 off 3) caught at third man to give RCB a massive boost.\n\nHead's opening partner Abhishek Sharma (31 off 13) did entertain the home crowd until his attempted slog ended up in the hands of wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Swapnil Singh, making his RCB debut, struck twice in his first over removing the dangerous South Africa duo of Aiden Markram and Henrich Klaasen. While Markram missed a full toss to be adjudged lbw, Klaasen was caught at mid-on after mistiming a lofted drive, leaving SRH at 56 for four in five overs.\n\nLeggie Karn Sharma then dismissed Nitish Reddy and Abdul Samad to shut the door on the opposition.\n\nEarlier, Patidar did the bulk of the work in his 65-run stand with Kohli who was focused on giving the strike to his partner, an approach which was questioned by Sunil Gavaskar on air.\n\nCameron Green (37 not out off 20) and Swapnil Singh (12 off 6) came up with timely strikes in the death overs to take RCB past 200.\n\nRCB were all guns blazing in the first three overs with Kohli and Faf du Plessis (25 off 12) going hard at the SRH bowlers, including opposition skipper Pat Cummins who conceded 19 runs in his first over.\n\nHowever, from 43 for no loss of the first 18 balls, RCB could only reach 61 for 1 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nDu Plessis was deceived by a slow short ball from T Natarajan to be caught by Aiden Markram at mid-off. Will Jacks (6 off 9) went for a wild slog sweep off a flighted delivery from leg-spinner Mayank Markande but could not make contact to be bowled, leaving RCB 65 for two in seven overs.\n\nThat was when Kohli and Patidar got together to take the innings forward.\n\nThe spinners were able to put pressure on the batters after the powerplay. As Kohli went for rotation of strike in this tough phase for RCB, Patidar broke the shackles by smashing Markande for four straight sixes in the 11th over.\n\nThe first two hits were down the ground before Patidar read Markande''s googly to send it over mid-wicket. The fourth and final six came off a wide and loopy delivery which Patidar dispatched over extra cover.\n\nSuch was the contrast in the style of approaches that Patidar took 19 balls to reach his fifty, while IPL''s leading run-getter Kohli took 37.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Unadkat applied the brakes on the free-scoring RCB innings by claiming the key wickets of Patidar, Kohli and Mahipal Lomror for a fine haul of 3-30 off four overs in his 100th outing in IPL.\n\nCameron Green (37 off 20) and Impact Player Swapnil Singh (12 off 6 balls) unleashed some big shots in the death overs as RCB crossed the 200-run mark again in IPL 2024. Swapnil hammered a four and six off the first two deliveries of the final over as RCB ended on a strong note.\n\nEarlier, Kohli and du Plessis struck a couple of fours each as they raced to 48 in the fourth over before the skipper departed.\n\nSkipper du Plessis struck Bhuvneshwar Kumar for three boundaries in the second over, the pick of them being a four crashed through the covers off a fullish delivery outside the off stump.\n\nIn the next over, he welcomed Pat Cummins with a superb six, scooping behind a delivery picked from around off-stump and planting him over the leg-side for the first six of this match. But the introduction of T. Natarajan brought his downfall when he holed out near the deep cover boundary trying to maintain the RCB scoring tempo in Power-play.\n\nThough he was out for 25, RCB raced to 61/1 in Power-play and though Kohli's scoring rate went down, Rajat Patidar made for that with some brilliant strokes. RCB were going strong despite losing Will Jacks cheaply for six after he played over a slower one from spinner Mayank Markande to make it 65/2.\n\nKohli, who started with a four off Abhishek Sharma's first delivery, struck back-to-back fours off Pat Cummins and struck a four and six off Natarajan in between singles. He went on to complete a slow half-century off 37 deliveries, hitting four boundaries and one six. This was his fourth successive half-century at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium.\n\nRajat Patidar more than made up for the slow going from Kohli with a blazing half-century off 19 deliveries. The highlight of Patidar's sensational knock was the four sixes he blasted off successive deliveries against Markande, lofting, clobbering and pulling the leg-spinner as the over cost SRH 27 runs.\n\nKohli and Patidar raised 65 runs for the third wicket partnership with the latter doing the bulk of scoring. The half-century of their partnership came in 23 balls with Patidar scoring 45 off them.\n\nHowever, SRH pulled things back a bit after Patidar fell by the sword, trying to play another big one but managed to flick the slow full toss from Jaydev Unadkat into the hands of Abdul Samad at deep square leg. Patidar's 20-ball 50 was studded with two boundaries and five maximums.\n\nKohli completed his half-century off 37 balls, but Unadkat got him in the next over, getting him to hole out to Samad as the former RCB skipper failed to break free from the shackles. Mahipal Lomror was out cheaply but Cameron Green played a fine cameo and with the help of Dinesh Karthik (11 off 6) helped RCB reach a defendable total.\n\nGreen struck his Australia skipper Cummins for a couple of fours in the 15th over and repeated the same in the 19th over while Swapnil Singh landed a couple of lusty blows in the final over to prop up RCB.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50, Cameron Green 37 not out; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30, T.Natarajan 2-39) against Sunrisers Hyderabad.", "source": {"uri": "newkerala.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "newKerala.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "awin_p@newkerala.com", "name": "Awin P", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

While the team has faced challenges, Kohli's outstanding batting form has shone through, placing him at the top of the Orange Cap leaderboard. This Thursday, they're gearing up for an exciting face-off against a strong Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) side led by Pat Cummins at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (@royalchallengers.bengaluru)\n\nIn their last encounter, SRH created history with a massive score of 287/3, setting a new IPL record. RCB put up a brave fight but fell short, ending at 262/7 in a thrilling chase. Ahead of their rematch, a viral video caught a light-hearted moment between Kohli and Cummins during their pre-match routines. Cummins, focused on batting drills, approached Kohli, who was taking a breather after a tough training session. Kohli greeted Cummins with a smile, setting the stage for an intriguing showdown between the two leaders.\n\nRCB has been struggling, especially in their bowling department, as highlighted by their difficulty in containing SRH's batting onslaught. Despite their strong batting performances, like the close chase against Kolkata Knight Riders, achieving overall balance remains a challenge for RCB.\n\nMeanwhile, SRH is riding high on Travis Head's exceptional form, with his recent record-setting partnership alongside Abhishek Sharma against Delhi Capitals. They aim to exploit RCB's bowling weaknesses and continue their winning streak.\n\nThe upcoming clash promises excitement, given the contrasting trajectories of the two teams. While RCB seeks redemption and a much-needed victory, SRH is focused on maintaining their dominance.

The loss was SRH's third in eight matches.\n\nConsidering the effectiveness of the spinners in the first innings, RCB opened the bowling with part-time off-spinner Will Jacks. The English man had the destructive Travis Head (1 off 3) caught at third man to give RCB a massive boost.\n\nHead's opening partner Abhishek Sharma (31 off 13) did entertain the home crowd until his attempted slog ended up in the hands of wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Swapnil Singh, making his RCB debut, struck twice in his first over removing the dangerous South Africa duo of Aiden Markram and Henrich Klaasen. While Markram missed a full toss to be adjudged lbw, Klaasen was caught at mid-on after mistiming a lofted drive, leaving SRH at 56 for four in five overs.\n\nLeggie Karn Sharma then dismissed Nitish Reddy and Abdul Samad to shut the door on the opposition.\n\nEarlier, Patidar did the bulk of the work in his 65-run stand with Kohli who was focused on giving the strike to his partner, an approach which was questioned by Sunil Gavaskar on air.\n\nCameron Green (37 not out off 20) and Swapnil Singh (12 off 6) came up with timely strikes in the death overs to take RCB past 200.\n\nRCB were all guns blazing in the first three overs with Kohli and Faf du Plessis (25 off 12) going hard at the SRH bowlers, including opposition skipper Pat Cummins who conceded 19 runs in his first over.\n\nHowever, from 43 for no loss of the first 18 balls, RCB could only reach 61 for 1 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nDu Plessis was deceived by a slow short ball from T Natarajan to be caught by Aiden Markram at mid-off.\n\nWill Jacks (6 off 9) went for a wild slog sweep off a flighted delivery from leg-spinner Mayank Markande but could not make contact to be bowled, leaving RCB 65 for two in seven overs.\n\nThat was when Kohli and Patidar got together to take the innings forward.\n\nThe spinners were able to put pressure on the batters after the powerplay. As Kohli went for rotation of strike in this tough phase for RCB, Patidar broke the shackles by smashing Markande for four straight sixes in the 11th over.\n\nThe first two hits were down the ground before Patidar read Markande's googly to send it over mid-wicket. The fourth and final six came off a wide and loopy delivery which Patidar dispatched over extra cover.\n\nSuch was the contrast in the style of approaches that Patidar took 19 balls to reach his fifty, while IPL's leading run-getter Kohli took 37.", "source": {"uri": "orissapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Odisha News, Odisha Latest news, Odisha Daily - OrissaPOST"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

RCB came close to beating KKR the other day but eventually lost by a solitary run. Lying at the bottom of the table, RCB will look to exchange Saurav Chauhan with Green in their Playing XI.\n\nSRH Playing XI: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins (c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan\n\nRCB Playing XI: Faf du Plessis (c), Virat Kohli, Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Saurav Chauhan, Mahipal Lomror, Vyshak Vijayakumar, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Lockie Ferguson.\n\nSRH Squad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Aiden Markram, Abdul Samad, Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins(c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, T Natarajan, Mayank Markande, Umran Malik, Anmolpreet Singh, Glenn Phillips, Rahul Tripathi, Washington Sundar, Upendra Yadav, Jhatavedh Subramanyan, Sanvir Singh, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Marco Jansen, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Agarwal\n\nRCB Squad: Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai, Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Manoj Bhandage, Mayank Dagar, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Himanshu Sharma, Rajan Kumar, Cameron Green, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Swapnil Singh, Saurav Chauhan.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "misha_ghosh@insidesport.in", "name": "Misha Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Toss, Playing XI updates", "body": "Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru IPL 2024 Live Score: This season has seen unprecedented excitement when it comes to the Sunrisers Hyderabad matches due to their blistering batting performances. With big hitters like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and Henreich Klaasen in their midst, Hyderabad under Pat Cummins have already broken the record for the highest IPL total in history, twice and fans are waiting with bated breaths to see if they can cross the magic figures of 300.\n\nOn Thursday, Hyderabad will take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru, the team against which they had made the highest IPL score in history- 287- the last time these two locked horns. With Bengaluru's bowling attack a suspect this season, this return fixture might be the one where SRH touches 300.\n\nTalking about Bengaluru, their play-off hopes are all but extinguished after the loss to Kolkata Knight Riders last Sunday, which was their 7th loss in the season. Even though Virat Kohli has been among the runs, it has not translated into wins for the franchise which is currently lodged at the 10th position in the points table.\n\nFollow the score and updates of SRH vs RCB from Hyderabad below.\n\nLive Blog\n\nIPL 2024, SRH vs RCB LIVE Cricket Score: Catch all the action between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru from the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad.\n\nHow Pat Cummins turned Sunrisers Hyderabad from laggards in 2023 to title contenders in 2024\n\nIn 2023 Sunrisers Hyderabad won only four games in the entirety of the campaign but this season, they have already won five from eight games and are contenders not only to end up in the top four but if things fall in place, their second trophy after 2016 under Pat Cummins.\n\nGoing into the season there was an element of not knowing what to expect from the side and Skipper Cummins- the player who was brought for a heavy price tag of 20.50 crores despite having a mediocre bowling record in IPL before the current season. Neither has he captained any IPL side or Australia in T20Is before but had proven his leadership for Australia in other formats.\n\nHowever, leading a country and a franchise is comparing oranges to apples. Leading Australia where he has known his players for the majority of his career is quite different from leading an IPL side where he has to adapt and understand the skill sets of players sometimes he is unaware of in a short space of time. But all speculations were put to rest once the tournament started.

The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad is hosting the contest.\n\nRCB captain Faf du Plessis won the toss and opted to bat first in the contest. He gave a brisk start to RCB with a cameo of 25 (12) before departing in the fourth over. Virat Kohli also played some aggressive shots to take his side to 61/1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nHowever, Kohli (51 in 43 balls) slowed down after six overs and dropped into the anchor role. Rajat Patidar ensured that the run rate stayed healthy by smashing a 19-ball half-century, continuing his good hitting form. Patidar and Kohli perished after reaching their respective half-centuries, leaving the finishing job to the middle-order.\n\nCameron Green provided the finishing blitz with a valuable knock of 37* (20) to help the Royal Challengers breach the 200-run mark. Jaydev Unadkat starred with the ball for SRH, ending with brilliant figures of 4-0-30-3.\n\nFans enjoyed the high-scoring first innings of the 41st match of IPL 2024 between SRH and RCB. They expressed their reactions to the action by sharing hilarious memes on X and Instagram.\n\nHere are some of the best memes:\n\n\"The surface is two-paced\" - RCB batter Rajat Patidar after his blazing half-century in 1st innings of IPL 2024 match vs SRH\n\nAt the mid-innings break, Royal Challengers Bengaluru middle-order batter Rajat Patidar reflected on the action that unfolded during the first innings and said:\n\n\"The surface is two-paced, especially for the fast bowlers. You can use cutters well on this wicket. The spinners should try to bowl back of a length as much as possible.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\"I was just trying to plan my innings. I was not thinking about it (the fastest fifty for Royal Challengers Bengaluru record). It was not a plan (to attack Markande). I started well in the over, so I was trying to maximise the over. My plan playing the spinners is to pick up as many runs and put pressure on them.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/7e8f8-17140607605924-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

In the last two games, the opponents have raked up totals in excess of 200.\n\nRCB batters have worked hard to make up for their severe shortcomings in bowling, but for such a lopsided squad in terms of balance, the task to produce an all-round performance looks nearly impossible.\n\nTo their credit, RCB fought incredibly hard with the bat but were unfortunate to have lost to Kolkata Knight Riders by a mere one run after conceding 222/6. Moreover, a collective batting effort must have pleased the RCB management to a large extent.\n\nHe was a victim of a contentious call but Virat Kohli remains RCB's best batter in the tournament so far, having scored 379 runs to keep the Orange Cap in possession.\n\nBut hot on his heels are a few others including SRH's Head, who is making most of his purple patch.\n\nHead's game is designed not only on aggressiveness and ability to cash in on every opportunity, his ability to find gaps at will makes him a compulsory watch.\n\nAbhishek Sharma has flourished in Head's company and Heinrich Klaasen too has made merry with the bat this season. Overall, SRH's compelling shows with the bat have made the job of their bowlers and skipper Pat Cummins easier.\n\nSRH are placed comfortably at the third position in the table with 10 points from seven matches. While the journey so far has been fuelled by the batters' fire, SRH would know their bowling would be tested along the way and Cummins' men could do well to watch out against a hurting RCB side.\n\nRead Less\n\nAfter Delhi Capitals triumph over Gujarat Titans, RCB's hopes of sealing a place in the playoffs is slim in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), however, there is still a chance for RCB to swing fortune to their side in the remaining six games. RCB are currently at the bottom of the table with two points in eight matches and a negative run rate of 1.046. In order to make a bid for a spot in the final four, RCB need to win their remaining six matches which includes their clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. If they stand victorious in the rest of the games, their points tally will read 14 and the remaining results need to fall in their favour which would help them prevail in the knockout stages with a better Net Run Rate (NRR). If the top-3 teams according to the current points table Rajasthan Royals go on to win four of their remaining six, while Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad win five of their remaining seven matches, then they will finish on 22, 20 and 20 points respectively. In such a scenario, it will be possible that RCB, with 14 points, will finish fourth with the other teams ending the group stage with 12 or less than that. In a highly unlikely scenario, RCB could also finish in the third spot, but for that to happen the top three teams in the group stage would need to win just a single match in their remaining six matches. Mathematically, RCB are still in contention to make the cut for the knockout stage but they would need to switch through gears and win their remaining six games with a good margin to improve their NRR.

Du Plessis didn't score big but Kohli managed to reach a half-century, although a very slow one. Rajat Patidar was the top performer for RCB as he hit a sensational 19-ball half-century to help his side register a total of 206/7.\n\nDefending the total, RCB bowlers were right on the money from the very first over as they dismissed dangerous Travis Head early. RCB picked 4 more wickets inside the powerplay and dismissed all the big guns. Then, the middle and lower-order batters of SRH tried to fight but it wasn't enough for the win. In the end, RCB restricted SRH to 171/8 to win the match by 35 runs.\n\nAt the post-match presentation ceremony, Faf du Plessis said that they have shown some good performances in the last few games, but have finished on the losing side, which led to the low confidence in the dressing room. Faf du elaborated:\n\n\"Last two games, we've shown great signs of fight. SRH game was 270 plus, we got 260. KKR game as well - 1 run. We've been close for a while, but you need to win matches to get confidence as a group. Will sleep easier tonight. You can't speak confidence into the group, can't fake confidence into the group. Only thing that gives confidence is performances.\"\n\nFaf du Plessis noted that Virat Kohli has been getting much-needed support from the other batters of the team after doing the heavy lifting in the first half of IPL 2024. Faf du Plessis further labeled RCB's home ground - Chinnaswamy - as a big frustration for them because it is a graveyard for bowlers. Faf du Plessis elaborated:\n\n\"The competition is so strong, the teams are so strong that you'll get hurt if you're not at 100 percent. More guys scoring runs now. First half of the tournament only Virat was scoring runs. Greeny scoring runs now will be massive for him. We know that Chinnaswamy, that's been a big frustration for us. It's a difficult ground to bowl at. We've tried to find a recipe for it, but it's tough.\"\n\nIn their first match in the Indian Premier League 2024, the batters of both teams made most of the conditions on the offer at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru and annihilated the bowlers to produce the highest IPL total and the highest match aggregate in all T20s with a tally of 549 runs.\n\nBatting first, SRH posted 287/3 riding on the back of Travis Head's remarkable century and Heinrich Klaasen's brilliant half-century with Abhishek Sharma, Abdul Samad and Aiden Markram chipping in with significant runs. Only two RCB bowlers were among the wickets with Lockie Ferguson picking 2 and Reece Topley bagging one wicket on April 15.\n\nThen, RCB finished their innings on 262 for 7, thanks to Dinesh Karthik and Faf du Plessis' batting masterclass. Virat Kohli, Mahipal Lomror and Anuj Rawat also tried their best but RCB eventually lost the match by 25 runs.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuj_Rawat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anuj Rawat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chinnaswamy_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M.

The Bengaluru-based team's IPL journey is filled with many ups and downs, grooming one of the finest cricketers of the league and a loyal fanbase despite not clinching a title so far in tournament history.\n\nBefore this encounter against SRH, the Faf du Plessis-led side had won 117 matches and suffered defeats in 127 games out of 249 fixtures the franchise has played so far with four games ending with no results. Their win percentage is 46.18 per cent.\n\nEarlier in the day, RCB posted a video on their official social media handle, featuring their star players. Former skipper Virat Kohli, in the video, talked about the fans' loyalty to the team and their unwavering support, which has been there for 17 years.\n\n\"Loyalty, as simple as that and they keep showing examples of unwavering support, commitment and loyalty towards the team that they love so much,\" Kohli said in the video.\n\nOther players, including skipper Faf du Plessis, Glenn Maxwell and Mahipal Lomror also hailed the fanbase of the franchise. \"It's been a long time, and it's nice to come back and the fans have been so loyal for a long period of time,\" Maxwell said in the video.\n\n\"I haven't seen a more loyal fanbase than this personally,\" Lomror added. \"So much passion, so much energy,\" Du Plessis said.\n\nRCB has reached the final on three occasions - 2009, 2011 and 2016. However, they are yet to lift the trophy even once, losing by six runs to Deccan Chargers (now Sunrisers Hyderabad) in 2009, losing by 58 runs to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the 2011 edition and by eight runs against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2016.\n\nApart from that, Men in Red and Blue has made it to the playoffs of the tournament five more times in 2010, 2015, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Kohli was roped in by the franchise in 2008, the inaugural season of the IPL, and ever since, has played 245 matches for the team. He is the only player who has played for only one franchise in the tournament history so far. He has amassed 7,642 runs with a record eight hundred, the most by an individual, and 52 half-centuries to his name.\n\nCrafty leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who played for the franchise from 2014-21, is the leading wicket-taker for RCB, with 139 wickets in 113 matches. Currently, Chahal is the only bowler who has claimed 100 wickets for the franchise. Pacer Mohammed Siraj is the current leading wicket-taker for RCB among players still associated with the franchise, with 73 scalps in 80 games.\n\nBefore this season, RCB held the record of smashing the highest team total in IPL history which they posted against Pune Warriors India (PWI) in 2013. However, Sunrisers Hyderabad broke it twice by registering totals of 277 and 287, the latter against RCB recently.\n\nFaf du Plessis and Co. also holds the unwanted record for the lowest IPL total, being bundled out for 49 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2017.\n\nComing to the ongoing season, RCB need to win all of their remaining six matches and wish for the other results to come in their favour to secure a spot in the playoffs. Currently, they are placed at the bottom of the points table with a win and seven losses, giving them only two points. SRH, on the other hand, is in the third spot with five wins and two losses, giving them 10 points.\n\nIn the ongoing tournament as well, Kohli is the current Orange Cap holder with 379 runs in eight matches at a strike rate of 150.40 while left-arm pacer Yash Dayal is the highest wicket-taker for the side and stands at 24th spot in the leading wicket-taker list.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deccan Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahipal_Lomror", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahipal Lomror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzvendra_Chahal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuzvendra Chahal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Dayal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yash Dayal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_Warriors_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pune Warriors India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/25-04-2024/1200-675-21312891-942-21312891-1714047568146.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Unadkat applied the brakes on the free-scoring RCB innings by claiming the key wickets of Patidar, Kohli and Mahipal Lomror for a fine haul of 3-30 off four overs in his 100th outing in IPL.\n\nCameron Green (37 off 20) and Impact Player Swapnil Singh (12 off 6 balls) unleashed some big shots in the death overs as RCB crossed the 200-run mark again in IPL 2024. Swapnil hammered a four and six off the first two deliveries of the final over as RCB ended on a strong note.\n\nEarlier, Kohli and du Plessis struck a couple of fours each as they raced to 48 in the fourth over before the skipper departed.\n\nSkipper du Plessis struck Bhuvneshwar Kumar for three boundaries in the second over, the pick of them being a four crashed through the covers off a fullish delivery outside the off stump.\n\nIn the next over, he welcomed Pat Cummins with a superb six, scooping behind a delivery picked from around off-stump and planting him over the leg-side for the first six of this match. But the introduction of T. Natarajan brought his downfall when he holed out near the deep cover boundary trying to maintain the RCB scoring tempo in Power-play.\n\nThough he was out for 25, RCB raced to 61/1 in Power-play and though Kohli's scoring rate went down, Rajat Patidar made for that with some brilliant strokes. RCB were going strong despite losing Will Jacks cheaply for six after he played over a slower one from spinner Mayank Markande to make it 65/2.\n\nKohli, who started with a four off Abhishek Sharma's first delivery, struck back-to-back fours off Pat Cummins and struck a four and six off Natarajan in between singles. He went on to complete a slow half-century off 37 deliveries, hitting four boundaries and one six. This was his fourth successive half-century at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium.\n\nRajat Patidar more than made up for the slow going from Kohli with a blazing half-century off 19 deliveries. The highlight of Patidar's sensational knock was the four sixes he blasted off successive deliveries against Markande, lofting, clobbering and pulling the leg-spinner as the over cost SRH 27 runs.\n\nKohli and Patidar raised 65 runs for the third wicket partnership with the latter doing the bulk of scoring. The half-century of their partnership came in 23 balls with Patidar scoring 45 off them.\n\nHowever, SRH pulled things back a bit after Patidar fell by the sword, trying to play another big one but managed to flick the slow full toss from Jaydev Unadkat into the hands of Abdul Samad at deep square leg. Patidar's 20-ball 50 was studded with two boundaries and five maximums.\n\nKohli completed his half-century off 37 balls, but Unadkat got him in the next over, getting him to hole out to Samad as the former RCB skipper failed to break free from the shackles. Mahipal Lomror was out cheaply but Cameron Green played a fine cameo and with the help of Dinesh Karthik (11 off 6) helped RCB reach a defendable total.\n\nGreen struck his Australia skipper Cummins for a couple of fours in the 15th over and repeated the same in the 19th over while Swapnil Singh landed a couple of lusty blows in the final over to prop up RCB.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50, Cameron Green 37 not out; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30, T.Natarajan 2-39) against Sunrisers Hyderabad.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Kohli scored 51, his 53rd fifty in the IPL, but he got there in 43 balls on a pitch that was good for batting. RCB posted 206 on the board despite Kohli's slow knock, thanks to a sensational 19-ball fifty from Rajat Patidar.\n\nSRH vs RCB: Updates | Scorecard\n\nVirat Kohli started strongly after Faf du Plessis won the toss and opted to bat at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, which was expected to offer another run-fest. Taking the attack to the likes of Pat Cummins and Abhishek Sharma, Kohli raced to 32 off 18 balls at the end of the powerplay. However, once the fielding restrictions were lifted, Kohli's strike rate dipped as SRH spinners, Shahbaz Ahmed and Mayank Markande, tied him down.\n\nKohli did not hit a single boundary after the powerplay and was dismissed by Jaydev Unadkat in the 15th over for 51. The RCB star managed just 19 runs in his last 25 balls as he slowed the RCB innings after the powerplay. Kohli added a 65-run stand with Rajat Patidar, but it was the 30-year-old who did the bulk of the scoring against the spinners. Patidar hit 4 sixes in an over against Markande even as Kohli was struggling to find any real bit of timing.\n\n\"In the middle, he just seemed to have lost touch. I am not sure of the exact numbers, but I think from 31-32 to the time he got out, he did not hit a boundary. So at the end of the day, when he got out\u00e2\u0080\u00e6 when you are facing the strike in the first ball of the innings and you get out in the 14th or the 15th over, you have got strike rate of 118, that's not what your team expects from you,\" Sunil Gavaskar told Star Sports.\n\nMeanwhile, former Australia opener Simon Katich made a sharp assessment, saying Kohli's knock cost RCB's chances of pushing for a 220-plus total after they got off to a good start in the powerplay against SRH, who have been scoring 200-plus totals for fun.\n\n\"Yeah, there is no doubt he lost impetus. I think Rajat Patidar played beautifully, and he was the one who was trying to hit the fours and sixes. Virat Kohli probably needed to do that. I think that the sub 120 strike rate probably cost RCB 220-plus against SunRisers. Against SRH, 206 on the board, might not be enough,\" Katich said.\n\nRCB are on a 6-match losing streak and are rooted to the bottom of the points table with just 2 points from 8 matches. However, Kohli is the leader of the Orange Cap table for most runs in IPL 2024.

Swashbuckling openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma along with promising batters like Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, Abdul Samad, and Nitish Reddy form a formidable batting unit capable of setting massive totals.\n\nHaving scored 287 against RCB in their first meeting of the season and 266 against Delhi Capitals (DC) at the Arun Jaitely Stadium in New Delhi, SRH aim to breach the 300-run mark, promising IPL fans a spectacle of runs.\n\nThe Uppal pitch, known for its batting-friendly conditions, has seen Hyderabad excel with the bat previously, smashing a massive 277-run total against a bowling attack led by pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nTravis Head and Abhishek Sharma provide a blistering start to their side early on, followed by some clean power hitters to finish the game. SRH have registered the highest-ever powerplay total, racking up 125/0 against DC. They have also posted three 250+ run totals so far in the tournament and would be eyeing to cross the 300-run mark with another dominant batting display against Bengaluru's bowling attack.\n\nOn the other side, RCB, captained by Faf du Plessis, is eager to bounce back after a string of defeats. Despite Virat Kohli's stellar form and Dinesh Karthik's classic finisher innings, Bengaluru's bowling will face a stern test against Hyderabad's aggressive batting lineup. With bowlers like Mohammed Siraj, Lockie Ferguson and Reece Topley, Bengaluru hopes to contain Hyderabad's onslaught and register a crucial win to salvage their season.\n\nThe head-to-head record favours Hyderabad slightly, having won three out of the last five encounters against Bengaluru. However, recent form and individual performances, including Virat Kohli's race for the Orange Cap and Pat Cummins' sharp captaincy tactics, add intrigue and excitement to this clash.\n\nKohli (379) is at the top of the Orange Cap (most runs) race while Head (324) is 55 runs away. With this, this fight is also going to decide the matter of the orange cap. Another interesting battle will be between Kohli and left-arm pacer T Natrajan who is making the headlines with his sharp yorker and slower deliveries with both new and old ball. T Natarajan (10) is placed ninth in the most wickets list led by Bumrah with 13 wickets, who currently holds the 'Purple Cap'\n\nProbable Playing XI:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen (wicket-keeper), Nitish Reddy, Shahbaz Ahmed, Abdul Samad, Pat Cummins (captain), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, T Natarajan\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru: Faf du Plessis (captain), Virat Kohli, Will Jacks, Rajat Patidar, Cameron Green, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik (wicket-keeper), Karn Sharma, Lockie Ferguson, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Siraj", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

In contrast, RCB are having a nightmare with just one win from eight matches to be languishing at the bottom of the pile.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The right-hander was in sublime touch, smashing a scintillating 50 runs off a mere 20 balls. His innings were adorned with 2 boundaries and an impressive 5 sixes, putting SRH bowlers under immense pressure.\n\nTogether with Virat Kohli, Patidar formed a threatening partnership that was steering RCB towards a formidable total. However, their promising stand was cut short by SRH's Jaydev Unadkat in the 13th over. Unadkat's dismissal of Patidar broke the crucial partnership and provided SRH with a much-needed breakthrough.\n\nDespite Patidar's dismissal, RCB managed to post a challenging total of 206/7 in their 20 overs, setting up an intriguing contest for the Sunrisers Hyderabad batsmen.\n\nAfter winning the toss, RCB captain Faf Du Plessis opted to bat first. The opening pair of Virat (51) and Du Plessis got off to a solid start, adding 48 runs for the first wicket. However, Thangarasu Natarajan provided SRH with their first breakthrough by dismissing Du Plessis for 25 runs off 12 balls, which included three fours and a six.\n\nIn the seventh over, Mayank Markandey struck for SRH, removing Will Jacks (6). Virat and Patidar then built a strong partnership. Despite losing Mahipal Lomror (7) and Dinesh Karthik (11) cheaply, Cameron Green's unbeaten 37 off 20 balls and Swapnil Singh's unbeaten 12 off 8 balls propelled RCB to a formidable total.\n\nUnadkat was the pick of the bowlers for SRH, claiming three wickets, while Natarajan, Pat Cummins, and Mayank Markandey chipped in with two, one, and one wicket respectively.\n\nUNI BDN GNK", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

However, Natarajan quickly read the conditions and tried changing pace.\n\nFaf du Plessis tried to flat bat a slower delivery bowled into the pitch from T Natarajan. However, the batter couldn't get enough contact to clear the inner field and lobbed it high in the air. Former SRH skipper Aiden Markram settled himself under it and took a simple catch to break the partnership.\n\nHere's a video of the dismissal:\n\nThe RCB captain has been showing signs of returning to form after a tough start to IPL 2024. When on song, he can take the game away from the opposition single-handedly, so it was a pretty timely wicket from the hosts' perspective.\n\nRCB need Patidar and Kohli to explode in second half\n\nSoon after dismissing Du Plessis, SRH got another big wicket in the form of Will Jacks. The all-rounder tried a slog-sweep leg-spinner Mayank Markande but was done in the trajectory and saw his stumps castled.\n\nAfter a quick start, Virat Kohli has somewhat slowed down and understandably so as RCB have lost a couple of big wickets. However, Rajat Patidar has given the visitors the momentum they needed.\n\nThe Madhya Pradesh batter is known for his ability to take down spinners and did just that with four back-to-back sixes off Mayank Markande.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru scored 206/7 from their 20 overs after winning the toss and opting to bat first.\n\nVirat Kohli (51) and Rajat Patidar (50) were the two leading run scorers for the visitors. Cameron Green scored 37 not out from 20 balls to give the much-needed push towards the end of the innings. Jaydev Unadkat was the best bowler for SRH with figures of 3/30 from four of his four overs.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: 50 runs off 4.4 overs\n\nFor the first time this tournament, the SRH batters found themselves in trouble. Travis Head was caught by Karn Sharma off Jacks for 1. Yash Dayal then got the wicket of Abhishek Sharma for 31. Swapnil Singh then got the big wicket of Aiden Markram for 7.\n\nPowerplay: Overs 0.1 to 6 (Mandatory - 62/4)\n\nSwapnil Singh was struck for two sixes in his opening over. The first was by Nitish Reddy during a free hit. This was followed by Heinrich Klassen hitting the left-arm spinner for a six before giving a simple catch to Cameron Green to leave the hosts reeling. When the powerplay was over it was Shahbaz Ahmed and Nitish Reddy who were batting.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: First Strategic time-out (85/5 from 9 overs)\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru bowlers were all over SRH batters with wickets at regular intervals. The onus was on Abdul Samad and Shahbaz Ahmed to take the team to a fighting total before launching a final assault.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: 100 runs from 11 overs\n\nKarn Sharma rocked the SRH team once again when he had the wicket of Abdul Samad for 10. Pat Cummins came to the wicket and hit two sixes off two balls to get the score past 100 at the end of 11 overs. At that stage, SRH still needed 103 runs from 9 overs left to play.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: Second Strategic Time-Out (132/7 from 15 overs)\n\nBarring a brief fight from Pat Cummins who scored 31 runs from just 15 balls, none of the SRH batters were up for a fight. By the time the second time-out was taken the home team needed 75 runs from 30 balls to more or less be ruled out of the contest.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: 150 runs from 17.1 overs\n\nShahbaz Ahmed was the only man to put up a fight with the bat as he took his team past the 150 mark. A six off Lockie Ferguson was enough to put some respectability into the SRH batting on what was an ordinary day with the bat in hand.\n\nEnd of the match: Sunrisers Hyderabad 171 for 8 from 20 overs\n\nIt was a tame end to the game as the SRH batters finished on 171 to lose the game by 35 runs. The home team who have been amazing during the course of the tournament so far would be disappointed with some of the shots played by their batters today to give RCB a few cheap wickets.

It marked SRH's third loss in eight matches.\n\nConsidering the effectiveness of the spinners in the first innings, RCB opened the bowling with part-time off-spinner Will Jacks. The English man had the destructive Travis Head (1 off 3) caught at third man to give RCB a massive boost.\n\nHead's opening partner Abhishek Sharma (31 off 13) did entertain the home crowd until his attempted slog ended up in the hands of wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Swapnil Singh, making his RCB debut, struck twice in his first over removing the dangerous South Africa duo of Aiden Markram and Henrich Klaasen. While Markram missed a full toss to be adjudged lbw, Klaasen was caught at mid-on after mistiming a lofted drive, leaving SRH at 56 for four in five overs.\n\nLeggie Karn Sharma then dismissed Nitish Reddy and Abdul Samad to shut the door on the opposition.\n\nEarlier, Patidar did the bulk of the work in his 65-run stand with Kohli who was focused on giving the strike to his partner, an approach which was questioned by Sunil Gavaskar on air.\n\nCameron Green (37 not out off 20) and Swapnil Singh (12 off 6) came up with timely strikes in the death overs to take RCB past 200.\n\nRCB were all guns blazing in the first three overs with Kohli and Faf du Plessis (25 off 12) going hard at the SRH bowlers, including opposition skipper Pat Cummins who conceded 19 runs in his first over.\n\nHowever, from 43 for no loss of the first 18 balls, RCB could only reach 61 for 1 by the end of the powerplay.\n\nDu Plessis was deceived by a slow short ball from T Natarajan to be caught by Aiden Markram at mid-off.\n\nWill Jacks (6 off 9) went for a wild slog sweep off a flighted delivery from leg-spinner Mayank Markande but could not make contact to be bowled, leaving RCB 65 for two in seven overs.\n\nThat was when Kohli and Patidar got together to take the innings forward.\n\nThe spinners were able to put pressure on the batters after the powerplay. As Kohli went for rotation of strike in this tough phase for RCB, Patidar broke the shackles by smashing Markande for four straight sixes in the 11th over.\n\nThe first two hits were down the ground before Patidar read Markande's googly to send it over mid-wicket. The fourth and final six came off a wide and loopy delivery which Patidar dispatched over extra cover.\n\nSuch was the contrast in the style of approaches that Patidar took 19 balls to reach his fifty, while IPL's leading run-getter Kohli took 37.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Pat Cummins threatened for a brief while during his 15-ball 31, but Sunrisers had left themselves too much to get at the backend.\n\nAlso Check: IPL News 2024\n\nPatidar was awarded Player of the Match for his breathtaking half-century, which helped RCB keep a healthy run rate through the middle overs.\n\nAlso Read: Twitter Reactions: Fans troll Virat Kohli with 'Tuk Tuk' remark after sedated knock against SRH\n\nThe Australian all-rounder turned out to be the star of the match, as he played well with both bat and ball. Batting at No. 5, Green smashed five fours during his unbeaten knock of 37 off 20 balls. He took confidence from his brilliant outing with the bat and took a couple of wickets with the ball, conceding just 12 runs in two overs.\n\nThe right-handed batter had a dreadful start to IPL 2024 but is slowly showing his class. After scoring 52 off 23 balls against Kolkata Knight Riders in the last game, the 30-year-old slammed a 20-ball 50, hitting two fours and five sixes against Cummins and Co. His knock, not only gave the RCB innings some much-needed impetus but also set the ideal platform for the big hitters in the lower order to capitalise.\n\nVirat Kohli continued churning out the runs as he notched up his 53rd half-century in his illustrious IPL career. The former captain scored a watchful 51 off 43 balls, hitting four fours and one six. He became the first batter to cross 400 runs in IPL 2024. While some criticised Kohli for his slow approach, others felt that the knock was a perfect foil for Patidar during the important third wicket partnership of 65 runs off 34 balls.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1714066998812_virat.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 209, "textEnd": 217}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

While some lauded his anchor role, others lambasted his strike rate, deeming it a potential issue for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

Rajat Patidar stood out for the batting side, hammering 50 off only 20 balls. The right-handed batter slammed two fours and five sixes in his innings. Virat Kohli contributed 51 off 43, while Cameron Green chipped in with 37* off 20.\n\nWith the ball, Karn Sharma, Swapnil Singh and Green picked up two wickets each as Bengaluru held Hyderabad to 171-8. The chasing side lost in-form Travis Head for 1 and could never recover from the huge blow.\n\nDespite the win, RCB have only four points from nine matches. Their chances of qualifying for the playoffs are as good as over. They are mathematically still in it, but there are too many permutations and combinations at play and their fortunes are no longer in their own hands.\n\nFirst things first, Royal Challengers Bengaluru need to win all their remaining five matches. If they do that, they will finish on 14 points. However, in the last two seasons, with the IPL turning into a 10-team competition, teams have needed a minimum of 16 points to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe only way RCB could finish in the top four of the IPL 2024 points table is if the top three teams [currently Rajasthan, Kolkata and Hyderabad] finish the league stage with more than 16 points, while the other six sides end with not more than 12 points. In such a scenario, Bengaluru can progress to the playoffs as the fourth team with 14 points.\n\nThe probability of the same happening, however, is extremely low. While Rajasthan Royals are already on 14 points, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Lucknow have 10 points. Further, three sides - Chennai Super Kings, Delhi Capitals and Gujarat Titans - are on eight points. There is expected to be a close tussle for the fourth spot.

AP\n\nVirat Kohli added a couple of milestones to his name during Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) away match against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Thursday.\n\nLIVE | SRH vs RCB, IPL 2024 Match 41 in Hyderabad\n\nKohli has quite a few records to his name in what has been a glittering career so far. Not only is Kohli the leading run-scorer in the IPL, he also went past Sachin Tendulkar during last year's ICC World Cup to become the first batter to 50 centuries in One-Day Internationals.\n\nOn Thursday, Kohli became the first batter to score 400 or more runs 10 times in the IPL, going past Suresh Raina in the process. Chennai Super Kings (CSK) Raina, who had also represented Gujarat Lions, had achieved the feat nine times in a stellar career spanning 13 seasons between 2008 and 2021.\n\nKohli, who currently sits at at the top of the run-scorers list this season, became the first batter to go past 400 runs on Thursday en route to bringing up his third half-century of the season in 37 deliveries, having needed 21 runs to bring up the milestone ahead of start of the innings.\n\nKohli also went past 4,000 runs as an opener, which is a sizeable chunk of the 7,693 that he has scored so far in his career. Kohli brought up the milestone with back-to-back boundaries at the start of the third over.\n\nThe former India and RCB captain needs another 307 runs to become the first batter in IPL history to go past 8,000 career runs, which he could achieve in this very season should he score another century or two. He had scored an unbeaten 113 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in Bengaluru earlier this season, albeit in a losing cause.\n\nKohli was ultimately dismissed for 51 off 43 deliveries off Jaydev Unadkat's bowling, pulling an off-cutter straight to Abdul Samad at deep square leg. Unadkat, who made his 100th IPL appearance on Thursday, collected his second wicket as RCB lost their fourth wicket with 140 on the board.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresh_Raina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suresh Raina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/04/Virat-Kohli-SRH-RCB-AP-1200-2024-04-21d5db532bbdd74798fae259dffda494.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

They cleverly elected to bat first after winning the toss, which might have played a role in them getting an edge over SRH. Virat Kohli gave a good start for the visiting team as the other batters did their part to help RCB post 206 runs on the board in the first innings.\n\nMeanwhile, Virat Kohli has been on the receiving end on social media for his knock. Even though some appreciated his anchor role, many criticised his strike rate and consider it to be a problem if he continues with it in the upcoming T20 World Cup. However, if his team is winning games despite him playing slowly, is that a problem? Well, time will tell on what BCCI decides for the mega tournament.\n\nAlso Read - Twitter Reactions: Fans troll Virat Kohli with 'Tuk Tuk' remark after sedated knock against SRH in Match 42\n\nRajat Patidar, on the other hand, had a remarkable outing as he smashed 50 runs off 20 deliveries. Cameron Green too played a good cameo of 37 runs off 20 balls as RCB posted a healthy score but that didn't look enough.\n\nHowever, unlike in the majority of the games, RCB had a good day with the ball. Will Jacks picked up the wicket of Travis Head in the first over of the innings, which derailed SRH's game plan. Though Abhishek Sharma looked ruthless, like most of his knocks, the youngster couldn't capitalize. He got out scoring 31 runs off 12 balls, which resulted in a series of dismissals.\n\nTowards the fag end, Pat Cummins put up a show as he hit 31 runs off 15 balls, but it proved to be an impossible hill to climb. Shahbaz made 40* runs, but strike rate was a concern. Meanwhile, despite the win, RCB remain at the bottom of the table while SRH remain third.\n\n1. The debate continues\n\nStar batter Virat Kohli made 32 runs in 18 balls and followed that up with 19 runs off 25 deliveries. That seems to be a big problem as he couldn't capitalise on his start. He struggled in the middle and needs to act on that immediately to produce better results. There have been already enough discussions on Kohli's strike rate keeping the T20 World Cup in mind. In case he fails to improve, it will only gain momentum.\n\n2. Patidar and Green's crucial knocks\n\nIf not for Patidar and Green, RCB may have lost the game. Both showed a lot of intent, which played a part in helping RCB put a good total on the board and eventually get the win.\n\n3. Rare W for RCB bowlers\n\nAt the halfway mark, it was believed that RCB were at least 20 runs short. However, their bowlers put up a magnificent show and eventually got the job done pretty comfortably. Jacks picked up the dangerous wicket of Head, while Swapnil Singh, Karn Sharma and Green picked up two each to help RCB win their second match of the season.\n\nNot an ideal night. Few over par with the ball and unfortunately lost a few wickets throughout our innings. We were gonna bat first, it seems to be working for us. Before the last few wins, we were thinking that we were a bowl-first team. Didn't go our way. (Message to the group) I speak after wins, Dan (Vettori) speaks after losses. The boys have been going really well, it's T20 cricket, you are not going to win every game. Don't dwell on this too much. (High risk, high reward approach with the bat) I think it's our strong suit. It's not going to work every game. One or two games where it hasn't gone our way at the start, we still managed to get a good total. Still think this is the way forward for our boys.\n\nLast two games, we've shown great signs of fight. SRH game was 270 plus, we got 260. KKR game as well - 1 run. We've been close for a while, but you need to win matches to get confidence as a group. Will sleep easier tonight. You can't speak confidence into the group, can't fake confidence into the group. Only thing that gives confidence is performances. The competition is so strong, the teams are so strong that you'll get hurt if you're not at 100 percent. More guys scoring runs now. First half of the tournament only Virat was scoring runs. Greeny scoring runs now will be massive for him. We know that Chinnaswamy, that's been a big frustration for us. It's a difficult ground to bowl at.

However, little did the RCB fans know that it would take them exactly a whole month to register another two points.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) became only the second team to lose a match against RCB after the Red and Gold outfit put on a dominating show at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium on Thursday.\n\nRCB, electing to bat first, capitalized on a blazing knock by Rajat Patidar. The right-hander smashed a quickfire 50 off just 20 deliveries, propelling his team to an above par total of 206 runs. SRH's batting, known for its firepower, seemed subdued. Openers didn't provide a decent start, and the dismissal of key middle-order batsmen led RCB to clinch the match by 35 runs.\n\nVirat Kohli's innings against SRH was a tale of two halves. He came out firing, looking in imperious touch. The SRH bowlers felt the brunt of his early aggression as he unleashed some delightful strokes. Boundaries flowed freely off his bat, with four fours and a six adorning his scoring sheet, all within the powerplay.\n\nHowever, this early flourish proved to be short-lived. Following the powerplay, Kohli's scoring slowed down considerably. He struggled to rotate the strike and eventually fell to an attempted big shot in the 15th over. While he did manage a fifty, his knock left many fans and pundits underwhelmed, especially considering his blazing start.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) batting innings needed a spark, and Rajat Patidar was the man to provide it. The aggressive 30-year-old batsman came out swinging, hammering a blistering 19-ball fifty. This phenomenal knock stands as the joint-second-fastest fifty ever scored by a batsman for RCB in the IPL. Patidar's intent was clear from the very first ball, and he didn't hold back against bowler Mayank Markande, even smashing four consecutive sixes in a single over.\n\nAll-rounder Swapnil Singh proved to be a valuable asset for RCB in his debut match. While his contribution with the bat was a quickfire 12 runs off just 6 balls, it was his bowling that truly stole the show. In the second innings, he dismissed the dangerous Aiden Markram early on, putting RCB in a strong position.\n\nLater in the same over, when the swashbuckling Heinrich Klaasen tried to take him on by launching a big six, Swapnil held his nerve. He didn't let the pressure faze him, and instead, bowled a clever delivery that resulted in Klaasen's dismissal, solidifying RCB's grip on the match.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_jain@insidesport.in", "name": "Naman Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WIN-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 118, "textEnd": 126}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

But, hold on, they can still make the playoff without even having to bother about the NRR. How is that possible? So, they will first have to win their remaining six games and finish with 14 points. If things fall into place, 14 points could actually be good enough for them to go through. Remember, the chances are slim, but there is a chance for sure.\n\nThe ideal scenario for RCB is to hope that the top three teams - Rajasthan Royals, Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad - keep winning and seal the three playoff berths. That would mean there is spot for only one team as about three to four teams will get into the middle muddle.\n\nLet us assume that the high-flying Royals win four of their remaining six, and then the Knight Riders and Sunrisers win five of their remaining seven, then they will finish on 22, 20 and 20 points respectively. In that case, it is possible that RCB, with 14 points, will finish fourth with the other teams on 12 or fewer points.\n\nFor RCB, they have to start winning from tonight.

While Cummins' leadership has brought positive energy into the SRH dressing room, Head has provided explosive starts at the top of the order for the Orange Army.\n\nHead and Cummins had an excellent 2023 as well, where they helped Australia win ICC World Test Championship and ICC ODI World Cup. The two Aussies will be in action later tonight against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in IPL 2024.\n\nNot many fans would remember that Head played for RCB in 2017. In fact, in his last appearance for the franchise, he picked up two wickets, namely Corey Anderson and Pat Cummins.\n\nPat was a member of the Delhi Daredevils team in that tournament. It was the 56th game of IPL 2017 hosted by the Arun Jaitley Stadium, where RCB beat Delhi by 10 runs. Cummins tried his best to save the day for Delhi with the bat, but he ended up handing a catch to Virat Kohli at long-off while trying for a six off Head's bowling.\n\nYou can watch the video here:\n\nBatting at number seven, Cummins scored seven runs off three balls, which also included a six against Head before he lost his wicket. Head ended the match with figures of 2/30 in three overs.\n\nTravis Head scored his maiden IPL hundred against RCB 10 nights ago\n\nRCB released Travis Head after the 2017 season, and then, no franchise signed him for the next six years.

The RCB skipper also said that the only thing that can give confidence to the group is performances.\n\n\"Last two games, we've shown great signs of fight. SRH game was 270 plus, we got 260. KKR game as well - 1 run. We've been close for a while, but you need to win matches to get confidence as a group. Will sleep easier tonight.

The RCB skipper was happy to see Green be amongst the runs and also said that the team is yet to find the right recipe for the Chinnaswamy stadium.\n\n\"The competition is so strong, the teams are so strong that you'll get hurt if you're not at 100 percent. More guys scoring runs now. First half of the tournament only Virat was scoring runs. Greeny scoring runs now will be massive for him. We know that Chinnaswamy, that's been a big frustration for us.

The fourth and final six came off a wide and loopy delivery which Patidar dispatched over extra cover.\n\nSuch was the contrast in the style of approaches that Patidar took 19 balls to reach his fifty, while IPL's leading run-getter Kohli took 37.\n\nSRH, who have amassed 250-plus totals thrice this season, would be expected to gun down the target.", "source": {"uri": "orissapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Odisha News, Odisha Latest news, Odisha Daily - OrissaPOST"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Kohli scored a quick-fire 42 off 20 and faced two deliveries from Cummins, one of which he smashed for a boundary.\n\nHowever, in the bigger picture, it is all smiles for Cummins as SRH are currently third on the points table with five wins in seven outings.

Twitterati are going crazy after RCB's strong statement with their performances. Let's have a look at a few of those hilarious reactions.\n\nRCB vs SRH :After losing six games consecutively, RCB has finally ended their losing streak with a solid win over Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nSRH, who came into the game as favorites, didn't return as one. RCB beat SRH by 37 runs. In 20 overs, while batting in the first innings, RCB scored 206 runs, thanks to Rajat Patidar's impressive innings and the fiery cameo of Cameron Green. With this win, they have again find themselves into IPL playoff contention, as their chance to get into the playoffs 'technically exists,' but it all depends on team consistency and the results of other teams.\n\nAfter breaking their losing streak, RCB is slightly in good shape as they won this most important game. With this win, they have 4 points in their bank and have moved to 9th place in the points table. Although there is no certainty, only an assumption, if they play like in their upcoming 5 games and win all the games, they will reach 14 points. Looking at the history of the IPL, they can still qualify with these numbers.\n\nBut in this picture, RCB needs a side hero, and here the side heroes are other IPL teams that are placed above RCB in the points table and also fighting for their own playoff place. If they fall apart, it will certainly make way for RCB to reach the IPL playoffs in 2024.

With players like Abdul Samad, Mayank Agarwal, and Rahul Tripathi in SRH's squad, and Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, and Glenn Maxwell in RCB's squad, this promises to be a thrilling T20 encounter at 7:30 pm today.\n\nAlso Read: Spin legend Anil Kumble reveals his IPL Auction story\n\nAakash Chopra backs struggling RCB ahead of their match against dominating SRH\n\nAakash Chopra, a former cricket player for India, has highlighted that Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) still has a chance in the IPL 2024 playoffs, even with their current standing. On Thursday, April 25, at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, RCB -- who has only won one of their last eight games -- will take on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).\n\nChopra recognised that the RCB, under the leadership of Faf du Plessis, is in a difficult situation. He acknowledged that the team had not performed well enough throughout the event. Chopra claims that RCB's current record makes this season the \"joint-worst\" in IPL history. He expressed optimism about their future, though, saying that even if they have a difficult path ahead of them, it is still possible for RCB to turn things around and contend for the postseason. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Akash Chopra said:\n\nBangalore are not yet out. Of course, it's extremely difficult. They are at the bottom of the table. In fact, this has become the joint-worst season in their history, that you have played so many chances and have only two points,\"\n\nRCB is now at the bottom of the table with six straight losses. They only managed one win in the competition, which came against PBKS in Bengaluru. After that, they struggled mightily.\n\nAlso Read: Ex-international cricketer narrowly escapes death in leopard attack\n\nDespite this unsatisfactory run, Chopra maintained confidence in the team's capacity to turn things around. The former player for India emphasised the RCB's tenacity and their track record of pulling off comebacks. He underlined how crucial it is to win games for the squad as well as their devoted supporters, who have supported them wholeheartedly. Aakash Chopra added:\n\nHowever, there are two ways of playing.

The 41st game of the tournament between the teams is taking place at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nAfter opting to bat first, Royal Challengers Bengaluru openers Faf du Plessis (25) and Virat Kohli scored quick-fire runs at the top. They put the opposition team under pressure with their brutal power-hitting in the powerplay at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nHowever, Sunrisers Hyderabad pulled back things incredibly well. Mayank Markande played a key role in it as he removed in-form batter Will Jacks early in the innings. The leg-spinner produced a peach of a delivery to take the second wicket for his team against RCB.\n\nDuring the last ball of the 7th over, Will Jacks bowled a slow leg-spinner that didn't spin much. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru batter tried to swing it across the line but the ball went underneath the blade of the batter before hitting the off-stump and sending the batter packing.\n\nWill Jacks, who scored a brutal half-century in the last game against KKR, managed just 6 runs off 9 balls. The batter's wicket saw Royal Challengers Bengaluru lose their second wicket for 65 runs, after having a powerful start of 48 runs for the opening stand against Sunrisers Hyderabad.\n\nEarlier, Faf du Plessis perished after scoring a power-packed 25-run knock. He along with Virat Kohli made sure that they come out all guns blazing with the bat. The captain was removed by T Natarajan in the 4th over as he was caught by Aiden Markram.\n\nAfter Will Jacks got out, Rajat Patidar stole the limelight with his magnificent batting at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. He made sure that he kept the tempo high for his team and got some quick runs after losing two wickets in quick succession of time.\n\nRajat Patidar's best came in the 11th over when he took Mayank Markande to the cleaners. The batter slammed him for four consecutive sixes and made the bowler look clueless. He hit 27 runs in the over against the leg-spinner and put his team in the driver's seat.\n\nRajat Patidar raced away to his half-century in a flash. The batter brought up his second consecutive fifty of the season but he couldn't carry on as he fell immediately after that. The batter scored 50 runs off just 20 balls. He batted with a strike rate of 2 fours and 5 sixes before getting out to Jaydev Unadkat.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The Royal Challengers, who lost seven of their eight games so far, desperately require a win. Although RCB's qualification chances for playoffs look bleak, they are still in contention. Here's how they can qualify.\n\nAs mentioned, RCB have sealed just one win in eight games in IPL 2024 as of now. That came against Punjab Kings exactly a month ago (March 25). RCB, in their previous match suffered a one-run defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens. It was their sixth consecutive loss. RCB currently languish at the bottom with two points (NRR: -1.046).\n\nIPL 2024 standings: Rajasthan Royals (14 points), Kolkata Knight Riders (10), Sunrisers Hyderabad (10), Lucknow Super Giants (10), Chennai Super Kings (8), Delhi Capitals (8), Gujarat Titans (8), Mumbai Indians (6), Punjab Kings (4), and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (2).\n\nIt is worth noting that RCB are still in contention to reach the IPL 2024 playoffs. As per ESPNcricinfo, the Royal Challengers can finish in the top four without getting NNR into play, given other results fall in their favor. RCB, who can't afford another defeat, will have to win each of their remaining games to get to 14 points.\n\nBesides winning, RCB would want the incumbent top-three sides to win the majority of their matches.

He then slowed down, scoring only 18 off the next 19 deliveries.\n\nPatidar made up for lost time as he hit Hyderabad bowling to all parts of the ground. He hit spinner Mayank Markande for four sixes in an over before being caught in the deep off Jaydev Unadkat.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru's Rajat Patidar plays a shot during the Indian Premier League cricket match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad, India, Thursday, April 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A.)\n\nUnadkat also sent back Kohli before he could cut loose. Cameron Green then rescued Bengaluru from 140-4, scoring 37 not out off 20 balls, and pushing the score past 200.\n\nSunrisers\u00b4 openers have lit up the IPL with their heavy hitting in the power-play overs, but they failed to get going on the day.\n\nAustralian Travis Head fell for just one run, out caught off Will Jacks. His partner Abhishek Sharma did get a start, scoring 31 off 13 balls, but he was caught behind in the fourth over.\n\nHyderabad\u00b4s top order then fell apart to Bengaluru\u00b4s spinners - Aiden Markram was out for seven, while hard hitting Heinrich Klaasen also fell for the same total. Both were out to part-time left arm spinner Swapnil Singh, who finished with 2-40 in three overs.\n\nIn between, wrist spinner Karn Sharma bowled Nitish Reddy for 13 and then dismissed Abdul Samad too, as the hosts were down to 89-6 in 9.1 overs.\n\nShahbaz Ahmed hung in there for 40 not out off 37 balls, with skipper Pat Cummins also scoring 31 off 15 balls, but it was not enough after the initial collapse.\n\nHyderabad thus stayed third - equal on 10 points with Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants, but sandwiched between the two on net run-rate.\n\nIt was Bengaluru\u00b4s second win in nine games and it stayed 10th in the points table.\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru's Rajat Patidar celebrates his fifty runs during the Indian Premier League cricket match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Kolkata, India, Sunday, April 21, 2024.

A clear difference in approach was evident between his batting during the powerplay and after the fielding restrictions were relaxed.\n\nKohli, often criticized for his calculative approach with five fielders outside the circle, once again showed a tendency to slow down post-powerplay.\n\nThe former RCB skipper started aggressively, amassing 32 runs in the powerplay overs. He looked in great touch as he played some delightful lofted strokes against SRH pacers. However, his scoring pace dipped dramatically afterwards. He could only manage 19 runs in the next 25 balls faced, with his strike rate plummeting significantly as the spinners came into the attack.\n\nFortunately for Kohli and RCB, Rajat Patidar came to the rescue with a blistering 20-ball fifty, ensuring the momentum remained with the Challengers. Patidar's knock effectively masked Kohli's struggles and propelled RCB towards a competitive total over 200.\n\nA closer look at the numbers paints a clearer picture of Kohli's contrasting strike rates:\n\nThe data reveals a significant drop of nearly 70 runs in strike rate between the two phases. This was not a one-off for the IPL legend. Instead, this has been a pattern for Kohli in IPL 2024, whose strike rate dips down from 155.4 in the powerplay overs to 123.3 in the middle-overs (7-15).", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_jain@insidesport.in", "name": "Naman Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/virat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

RCB have now won their second match but remain at the bottom.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad virtually lost the match in the Power-play as they suffered four setbacks -- none more debilitating than the wicket of opener Travis Head for one run in the first over.\n\nRCB skipper Faf du Plessis had boldly decided to bat first against an in-form SRH and then continued with his fearless approach by opening the bowling with off-spinner Will Jacks. The move paid off as the 25-year-old English man struck gold on the last ball of the opening over when Head, who came in as an Impact Substitute, tried to hit him out of the park only to see the ball spin away and top edge it to Karn Sharma on the off-side.\n\nFellow opener Abhishek Sharma, who has a strike rate of 200-plus just like his opening partner Head, hammered a 13-ball 31 studded with three boundaries and two sixes before he fell to Yash Dayal, attempting a pull but mishits it, managing to slice in the air for keeper Dinesh Karthik to pouch a skier.\n\nIt became 41/3 in the fifth over when Aiden Markram tried to hit Swapnil Singh but completely missed the delivery to be trapped LBW for seven runs. And when a few deliveries later Heinrich Klassen, after hitting Swapnil for a six, was out for seven off 3 balls as SRH slumped to 56/4 in the fifth over and their chase of 207 was in disarray as they ended the Power-play at 62/4. Swapnil, who came in as an Impact Player, made a real impact by bagging the wickets of bit hitters Aiden Markram and Klassen.\n\nThe dangerous Nitish Kumar Reddy was castled by Karn Sharma playing an ugly switch hit despite the difficult situation his team was in as SRH slumped to 69/5. Abdul Samad (10), who greeted Lockie Ferguson with a swat over long-on off his first delivery, chipped back to Karn Sharma, totally foxed by the leg spinner as he jumped out even before the ball was released.\n\nPat Cummins raised SRH hopes by hammering Swapnil Singh for back-to-back sixes in the 11th over and blasted Karn Sharma for a four and six off successive deliveries in the next over, fell to fellow Aussie Cameron Green, trying to hit a short, wide delivery to Mohd Siraj at short third man, beaten by lack of pace in the delivery. He blazed to 31 off 15 balls, hitting one four and three sixes. SRH were 124/7 and the writing was clear on the wall. Green claimed one more wicket, sending back Bhuvneshwar Singh (13) as the run rate kept rising and SRH kept losing wickets.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru 206/7 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 51, Rajat Patidar 50, Cameron Green 37 not out; Jaydev Unadkat 3-30, T.Natarajan 2-39) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad 171/8 in 20 overs (Shahbaz Ahmed 40 not out, Abhishek Sharma 31, Pat Cummins 31;

When it comes off, as it has for Sunrisers Hyderabad this season, the team can look unmatchable.\n\nHowever, on Thursday at their home ground, Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they experienced the perils of playing the high-risk game.\n\nTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markaram and Heinrich Klaasen, batters who have put the fear of gods among the bowlers with their belligerent play, all perished early playing rash strokes in their bid to chase down RCB's total of 206 in their trademark style. At the end of the fifth over, the run machines had been humbled as the SRH innings lay in tatters at 56/4.\n\nThey never recovered from the poor start and finished on 171/8. The 35-run win was only RCB's second this season but the bigger relief would have been the end of their six-game losing streak. In eight games, SRH have now won five and lost three.\n\nOpting to bat first, RCB did well to post 200 plus on the board, but given how SRH have batted this season, many weren't sure it would be enough. However, once they managed to get rid of dangerman Head in the first over, RCB's chances immediately brightened up.\n\nThe move to start with the off-spin of Will Jacks proved to be a masterstroke. Having got just three runs off the first five deliveries, Head went for the big shot on the last ball. He couldn't keep his shape though as the ball spun away and took the top edge to be caught by Karn Sharma at short third-man.\n\nAbhishek duly took down Jack in his second over for 20 runs but left-arm pacer Yash Dayal had the dangerman slicing an intended pull for a high catch to wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik and they were two down for 37.\n\nIt was captain Faf du Plessis' dream day as every move of his worked like a charm. Giving the fifth over to debutant Swapnil Singh was rewarded with a double breakthrough. Markram missed a full toss to be trapped leg before wicket and Klaasen too played into the bowler's hand, ballooning a catch to Cameron Green at mid-on.\n\nOn the batting front, the platform for RCB was built by another half-century for Virat Kohli (51 off 43 balls). Rajat Patidar's 20-ball fifty and Cameron Green's 20-ball unbeaten 37 ensured they managed to cross 200.\n\nDuring his innings, Kohli, the top run-getter in the tournament, crossed the 400-run tally in just his ninth game. He thus became the first batter to score 400-plus runs in 10 or more IPL seasons.\n\nWhen RCB's opening pair of Kohli and captain Faf du Plessis provided a start of 43 in three overs, they looked set for a much bigger total than 206 they got. But SRH's wily pacer Jaydev Unadkat applied the brakes in the middle overs, from 13th to 17th to celebrate his 100th IPL game with a three-for to remember, picking up the big wickets of Kohli and Patidar.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Dayal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yash Dayal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinesh Karthik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/25/1600x900/ANI-20240425335-0_1714070023600_1714070042244.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

It served as the backbone on which their innings stood.\n\nAfter winning the toss and opting to bat, Kohli had raced to 32 off 18 balls in the first six overs of the powerplay. But once the field restrictions eased, He struggled to score freely off the SRH spinners Shahbaz Ahmed and Mayank Markande.\n\nAfter the Powerply, Kohli failed to score a single boundary, having hit four boundaries an a six in the six initial overs.\n\nBut as Sunil Gavaskar pointed out on commentary, batting with a strike rate of 118 in the 15th over after opening the inning is way short of what RCB expects from Kohli.\n\nThey were off the blocks quickly, with skipper Faf du Plessis (25 off 12) batting with determination. But his and Will Jacks' (6 off 9) dismissals jolted them.\n\nPatidar thumped leg-spinner Mayank Markande for four consecutive sixes in the 11th over as he reached his fifty in 19 balls, but fell in the very next ball.\n\nKohli, in contrast, lost momentum and reached his half century in 37 balls, to extend his lead at the top of the run-scoring charts with 430 runs in nine games, at an average of 61.43 and a strike rate of 145.76.\n\nIt was RCB's second win in nine games that tied them in four points with Punjab Kings but kept them at the bottom of the 10-team standings due to inferior run rate.\n\nSRH lost their third game in eight matches but remained third with 10 points.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Throughout this IPL season, Sunrisers Hyderabad has redefined T20 batting, breaching the 250-run mark on three occasions. Their aggressive approach knows no bounds, evident from their record-breaking 287/3 against RCB led by Travis Head, surpassing the IPL's highest-ever total....Read More\n\nIn their recent clash against Delhi Capitals, Sunrisers unleashed a brutal assault, setting a record 125/0 in the powerplay, hinting at the possibility of breaching the elusive 300-run mark. Against a fragile RCB bowling attack, SRH will back their chances to achieve the unthinkable.\n\nRCB, languishing at the bottom of the table, face an uphill battle with their bowling struggles, conceding 180+ in their last five matches. Despite RCB's batting resilience, their lopsided squad struggles to deliver all-round performances.\n\nIn a recent nail-biter against Kolkata Knight Riders, RCB's valiant batting effort was in vain, losing by a mere run after conceding 222/6. Virat Kohli remains RCB's standout performer, holding the Orange Cap with 379 runs, but SRH's Travis Head poses a strong challenge with his aggressive yet precise batting.\n\nHead's partnership with Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen has bolstered SRH's batting lineup, easing the pressure on bowlers and skipper Pat Cummins. SRH sit comfortably in third place with 10 points from seven matches, relying mostly on their batters' firepower.\n\nWhile SRH's batting has been formidable, they must remain vigilant against RCB's determination to bounce back from recent defeats.

The triumph ends RCB's losing streak and sets the stage for a potential comeback in the tournament.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru revived their IPL 2024 playoff aspirations with a convincing victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Faf Du Plessis-led side secured their second win of the season, ending a six-match losing streak. Despite the triumph, RCB remains at the bottom of the points table with 4 points, emphasizing the importance of winning all remaining matches to stay in contention for the Top 4. Sunrisers Hyderabad, despite the defeat, maintained their third position with 10 points from 8 matches. Rajasthan Royals currently lead the table with 14 points, followed by Kolkata Knight Riders with 10 points from 8 matches.\n\nRCB's 35-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad marked the end of their losing streak. Rajat Patidar's aggressive 50 off 20 balls complemented Virat Kohli's composed 51 off 43 balls as RCB posted a formidable total of 206 for seven after opting to bat. Despite a target within reach, the in-form SRH batting lineup faltered, managing only 171 for eight in 20 overs.\n\nThe win was a significant relief for RCB, who suffered seven defeats in their first eight games, while it was SRH's third loss in eight matches. Reflecting on the match, RCB all-rounder Cameron Green credited the captain and coach for the decision to bat first, acknowledging SRH's strong batting performance in previous games. Green also expressed his satisfaction with his performance and emphasized the importance of enjoying the victory.\n\nPatidar, Player of the match: I was just keeping things in my mind that control the controllables. Whenever I go back home, I try to solve every problem which I faced. I go for skilful batting setup. Nothing like that (plan to target spin?). Today I was backing myself to be in good shape against every bowler.\n\nFaf, RCB's captain: Last two games, we've shown great signs of fight. SRH game was 270 plus, we got 260. KKR game as well - 1 run. We've been close for a while, but you need to win matches to get confidence as a group. Will sleep easier tonight. You can't speak confidence into the group, can't fake confidence into the group. Only thing that gives confidence is performances. The competition is so strong, the teams are so strong that you'll get hurt if you're not at 100 percent. More guys scoring runs now. First half of the tournament only Virat was scoring runs. Greeny scoring runs now will be massive for him. We know that Chinnaswamy, that's been a big frustration for us. It's a difficult ground to bowl at. We've tried to find a recipe for it, but it's tough.\n\nMost consecutive defeats for RCB (IPL)\n\n- 7 defeats in 2018-19\n\n- 6 defeats in 2017\n\n- 6 defeats in 2024 - the sequence ended today", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01hwb8fmhgptp9fgv6z37nkn10/srh-vs-rcb-22.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The saying that try hard untill you succeed came true for the Royal Challengers Bengaluru as their terrible six-match losing streak finally ended on Thursday with a victory over hosts Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.\n\nWhen it seemed that it was almost all over for the Bengaluru franchise, they bounced back in the showpiece event by conquering one of the most deadly sides in the 10-team event, showing their class to the best of their abilities. The boys in Bengaluru camp exhibited their authority and gave a loud and clear message to all that they still exist and the game is yet not over for them.\n\nRCB silenced the power-hitters of the Hyderabad franchise and shut down all the trolls and critics after they registered their second win in the IPL 2024 after beating SRH by 35 runs in an all-round show. They became the only side in the event to beat the powerhouses in their den. In what can be affirmed as some light at the end of the tunnel for the Faf du Plessis-led side, the camp gained this much-needed victory which opens up their chances of sealing a playoff berth in the premier tournament.\n\nA masterclass in batting by none other that run-machine Virat Kohli headlined the show for RCB along with a swift fifty by Rajat Patidar which completed their aggressive innings. Skipper Plessis fast knock and Cameron Green's fruitful 37 clearly indicated that RCB were searching for the win.\n\nThis win has come as a a gift for the RCB side as it opens the doors for them to fight hard going forward and secure a place in the playoffs. If the Bengaluru franchise continue the winning way, they will end up securing 14 points in the table in the next fives games, that would put them in a place where they can seal a playoff berth. However unlikely it may seem, if other results also go their way, they will not have to go through the stern net run rate exercise and will qualify for the playoffs.\n\nFor RCB to qualify, the first scenario says that table-toppers Rajasthan Royals, Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad have to keep bagging wins to lend space for RCB to occupy the fourth spot. In this case, the top three will finish around 20, 22 points each and RCB would be be with 14 points while the others would be on 12 or below.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sumit_channa@news9live.com", "name": "Sumit Channa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RCB-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

His impressive display came in the 11th over, facing Mayank Markande's deliveries and dispatching them to all corners of the ground.\n\nThe first six soared over long off, followed by another straight hit on the next ball, leaving spectators in awe. Patidar then unleashed a powerful shot over deep mid-wicket, before sealing the over with a boundary over extra cover, accumulating 27 runs in total.\n\nRCB had made a brisk start with Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis adding 48 runs in under four overs. However, du Plessis' departure slowed the momentum, and RCB finished the powerplay at 61 for 1.

RCB set a target of 206 runs for the loss of 7 wickets in 20 overs, and then limited SRH to 171 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in the chase, securing a 35-run victory over the hosts.\n\nDespite losing their only third game of the eight they have played; Sunrisers Hyderabad remain at the 3rd position. On the other hand, the Bengaluru-based franchise ended their six-match losing streak in the tournament. However, even after their second win in the league, RCB remain at the bottom of the leaderboard.\n\nThe 2016 champions have won five out of their eight matches this season, making their record the third-best in the cash-rich league so far. They are just behind Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders. After a stunning performance against Delhi Capitals, the Pat Cummins led side had put themselves in a strong position to secure a playoff spot. With their talented players in every department, SRH will aim to win at least four more matches to finish in the top two spots. It seems unlikely that they will miss out on a playoff spot considering their form thus far.\n\n\"The boys have been going really well, it's T20 cricket, you are not going to win every game. Don't dwell on this too much. (High risk, high reward approach with the bat) I think it's our strong suit. It's not going to work every game.

This completes a huge milestone of their journey, which has seen a lot of ups and downs and the creation of some of the biggest league superstars and a loyal fanbase, despite not clinching a title yet.\n\nRCB is in desperate need of a win, having lost six successive games so far. They are at the bottom of the points table with a win and seven losses, giving them only two points. SRH is in the third spot with five wins and two losses, giving them ten points.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 249 matches so far, RCB has won 117 and lost 128. Four games have ended with no results. Their win percentage is 46.18 per cent.\n\nRCB has been a three-time IPL finalist in 2009, 2011 and 2016. However, they have not lifted the trophy even once, losing by six runs to Deccan Chargers in 2009, losing by 58 runs to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the 2011 edition and by eight runs against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2016.\n\nOther than these finals, RCB has made it to the final four stage of the tournament five more times in 2010, 2015, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nTalismanic batter Virat Kohli is the franchise's leading run-scorer with 7,642 runs at an average of 38.01 and a strike rate of over 130, with eight centuries and 52 fifties. His best score is 113*. Virat has been with the franchise since IPL's inception in 2008.\n\nSpinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who played for the franchise from 2014-21, is the leading wicket-taker for RCB, with 139 wickets in 113 matches. Mohammed Siraj is the current highest wicket-taker for the franchise among players still associated with the team, with 73 scalps in 80 games.\n\nAlso Read: World T20: Rahul vs Sanju, Avesh vs Bishnoi & Axar, Pandya's form under scrutiny\n\nOver the years, despite winning no IPL titles, RCB has managed to give fans a lot to remember. Be it the rescue acts and 360-degree hitting by South African legend AB de Villiers (4,491 runs in 156 matches at an average of 41.20 at a strike rate of over 158 with two centuries and 37 fifties), brute six-hitting by West Indies great Chris Gayle (3,163 runs in 85 matches at an average of 43.32, with a strike rate of over 152 with five centuries and 19 fifties), including his unbeaten 175* in 66 balls against Pune Warriors India back in 2013 and Virat Kohli's record-breaking season in 2016, in which he scored 973 runs at an average of above 81 and strike rate above 152 with four centuries and seven fifties and won the 'Orange Cap'.\n\nBy smashing 263 against PWI in 2013, the team till the start of this season held the record of highest total in IPL history, until Sunrisers Hyderabad broke it twice by registering totals of 277 and 287, the latter against RCB recently.\n\nIt also holds the record for the lowest IPL total, being bundled out for 49 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2017.\n\nThe dynamic trio of Kohli, De Villiers and Gayle brought to the franchise a lot of fandom in the 2010s. The legacy of this trio is now carried forward in 2020s by Kohli, Glenn (Maxwell) and Faf (Du Plessis), known as the 'KGF' among fans. Skipper Faf has scored 1,437 runs in 38 matches at an average of 39.91 and a strike rate of over 143 with 13 fifties, while Maxwell has made 1,246 runs in 48 matches at an average of 30.39 and a strike rate of over 158, with 12 fifties.\n\nOther than these aforementioned stars, big players like Rahul Dravid, Mark Boucher, Kevin Pietersen, Ross Taylor, Anil Kumble, KL Rahul, Marcus Stoinis, Yuvraj Singh, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Dale Steyn, Zaheer Khan, Wanindu Hasaranga and Mitchell Starc, etc have worn the team's colours.\n\nAhead of the game, RCB all-rounder Will Jacks talked about his side's batting unit, which underperformed to an extent this season. Jacks said that the batters will look to play with the same freedom as their recent game, in which they valiantly scored 262 against SRH's 287 and 221 to KKR's 222.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deccan Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_de_Villiers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AB de Villiers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gayle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Gayle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzvendra_Chahal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuzvendra Chahal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stoinis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stoinis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

But he never was able to pick up the pace since then despite batting till the 15th over. The stark contrast in strike rates will be even more concerning. Kohli was batting at 177.78 but it dipped down to 76 through the middle overs.\n\nRCB were able to get to a flying start in the powerplay thanks to both Kohli and the skipper Faf du Plessis going on the offensive. But the skipper was dismissed by Natarajan with a slower delivery which was mistimed and sent up for an easy catch for the man at covers.\n\nStay updated with the latest from IPL 2024, including top contenders for the IPL 2024 Orange Cap and IPL 2024 Purple Cap.

However, through the middle stages, Kohli and Will Jacks were unable to get going.\n\nSRH had used the favourable matchups against Kohli by using both Shahbaz Ahmed who is a left-arm orthodox bowler and the left-arm pacer, Unadkat who has a decent record against the Indian star. Rajat Patidar was able to keep up the pace as he hit yet another quickfire fifty in just 20 balls.\n\nREAD MORE: IPL 2024: Delhi Capitals Rope in Gulbadin Naib as Mitchell Marsh Replacement\n\nUnadkat finally had his man as he got the slower off-cutter which Kohli looked to pull but did not get the power as he was caught by the man at the square-leg boundary ropes for the wicket.

They have won just one match and lost seven matches so far. They are currently in the bottom place on the points table. The Bengaluru-based franchise badly wants to win to gain momentum and keep its hopes alive to move to the next stage. Thus, Faf du Plessis' men would like to come back to their winning momentum in the tournament. Moreover, RCB would like to take revenge for the previous encounter between the two, where Pat Cummins' Hyderabad reigned supreme at M Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru earlier.\n\nSpeaking about the last game of the Sunrisers, They started the innings with a bang, openers gave a blistering fantastic start, and Travis Head 89(32) played a magnificent innings which helped the Sunrisers to post a huge total on the board. Abhishek Sharma 48(12) who smashed from the first ball played a superb inning and gave good support to Head. In the end, Shahbaz Ahmed 59*(29) played a fantastic innings which pushed Sunrisers Hyderabad to post a huge total of 266. Speaking about the bowling of the Sunrisers, T Natarajan (4-1-19-4) bowled beautifully, which helped Pat Cummins' side win the game by a 67-run margin. His figures were outstanding in the huge scoring game. Nitish Kumar Reddy (2.1-0-17-2) who bowled superbly gave excellent support to the lefty pacer. Sunrisers will hope that all these will continue their good form.\n\nSpeaking about the last game of the Challengers, after the opener went early Will Jacks 55(32) and Rajat Patidar 52(23) both played magnificent innings which kept the Challengers in the game till the last ball of the match. These two stitched a fantastic partnership of 102 off just 55 deliveries where Challengers were in the winning moment and upper hand in the game. But Challengers lost these at the wrong time and lost four wickets including these two and two more early wickets in a span of two overs which was the turning point of the match. These two did not get support from other batters. Speaking about the bowling of the Challengers, Cameron Green (4-0-35-2) bowled beautifully and Karn Sharma (4-0-33-0) was economical but did not get wickets. Other bowlers could not support these two bowlers. Challengers will hope that all these will continue their good form and good support from other batters and bowlers as well.\n\nSRH vs RCB Head-to-Head: SRH and RCB have met each other 23 times in the tournament's history, with the Sunrisers winning on 12 occasions and the Challengers clinching 10 victories.

Sunrisers Hyderabad will host RCB for a match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium.\n\nJust 10 days ago, RCB hosted SRH for a game at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, where Travis Head destroyed the home side. Opening the batting for the Orange Army, Head amassed 102 runs off just 41 deliveries to help his side record the highest team total in the tournament's history.\n\nHead showed no mercy to any bowler of the RCB team and ended up hitting nine fours and eight sixes at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. The wicket at tonight's venue should also be a batter-friendly one, and there's a high chance of Head producing another incredible batting performance in IPL 2024.\n\nAlthough RCB's bowling attack has conceded heaps of runs this season, it is not like they do not have any talented bowler in their ranks. Travis Head is in the form of his life, making things difficult for the opposition. But here's a look at the three ways RCB can dismiss the dangerous SRH opener cheaply in tonight's clash.\n\n#1 Royal Challengers Bengaluru should think of unleashing Karn Sharma early against Travis Head\n\nHead has lost his wicket thrice before completing his half-century in IPL 2024. On two out of those three occasions, a spinner took his wicket. Noor Ahmad rattled his stumps in Ahmedabad, while Maheesh Theekshana dismissed him caught out at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium.\n\nRCB have a talented leggie in Karn Sharma in their squad. Karn has enormous experience of playing at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, having represented SRH in multiple IPL seasons before. A leg-spinner would normally bring the ball into the left-hander, but Karn is not a traditional leggie.\n\nHe knows how to outwit the batter with his variations. Perhaps, Faf du Plessis should hand the ball to him in the powerplay only tonight.\n\n#2 Mohammed Siraj can get rid of Travis Head early\n\nIt hasn't been the best IPL season for Mohammed Siraj, but he is the most reliable Indian pacer present in the RCB squad for IPL 2024. When SRH played against Punjab Kings in Mullanpur, Head was trapped in front of his stumps by Kagiso Rabada on the first ball itself.\n\nHowever, PBKS did not take a DRS, which later showed that Head could have been out for a golden duck. Siraj can follow Rabada's gameplan and fire a peach at Head to dismiss him in the first over itself.\n\n#3 An Aussie gets an Aussie?\n\nRCB have one of the best Australian all-rounders of all time, Glenn Maxwell, in their IPL 2024 squad. Maxwell has not played in the last few matches, but considering RCB's disappointing performance, the team management could bring him back into the playing squad for tonight's match.\n\nMaxwell is an off-spin bowling all-rounder, who can take the ball away from the left-hander. He has the habit of taking big wickets.

He plays 100 days a year and he's up for every single of those games,\" Cummins said.\n\nInterestingly, Kohli was bowled by Cummins for 54 in the 2023 ODI World Cup final, which proved to be one of the game-changing moments of the title clash that Australia went on to win by six wickets. It was Australia's record-extending sixth ODI World Cup triumph.\n\nPossibly with that dismissal at the back of his mind, Cummins chose to be cheeky in his reply to another question.\n\n\"My favourite memory of Virat? Can I say when I get him out?,\" he said, and followed it up with a smile.\n\nALSO READ: How to watch IPL in Canada\n\nIn RCB's earlier match against the Sunrisers in this IPL season, Kohli scored 42. The game saw SRH scoring IPL's highest ever total as they put up a gigantic 287 for 3 on the board. RCB made a match of it in run-chase but ended up short (262 for 7) and lost by 25 runs.\n\nKohli currently leads the Orange Cap standings with his tally of 379 runs in 8 matches, including one hundred and two fifties. He averages 63.16 and has scored his runs at a strike rate of 150.39.\n\nCummins added that while both he and Kohli are competitive on the field, they are fairly relaxed off it.\n\n\"We are both super competitive. I think off the field Virat is pretty relaxed and I am (also) pretty relaxed off the field,\" said the SRH skipper.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Kohli's lack of aggression after the powerplay overs was baffling as RCB were looking to set a massive total against SRH, who have been scoring 250-plus for fun in the ongoing season. Kohli's strike rate dipped as his innings progressed.\n\nVirat Kohli came out all guns blazing, starting his innings with a boundary against left-arm spinner Abhishek Sharma. He then showcased intent against SunRisers captain Pat Cummins, dancing down the track and welcoming him into the attack with a boundary. Kohli was looking set for a big total as he was on 32 at the end of the 6-over mark, hitting 4 boundaries and a six in 18 deliveries.\n\nSRH vs RCB: Updates | Scorecard\n\nHowever, Virat Kohli did not hit a single boundary after the powerplay. In fact, he managed just 19 runs from 25 balls after the powerplay -- when more than 2 fielders were allowed outside the 30-yard circle. Kohli struggled against spinners Shahbaz Ahmed and Mayank Markande as his scoring rate dropped drastically. The slower balls from Jaydev Unadkat also troubled Kohli and the former captain fell to the left-arm pacer 15th over.\n\nKohli's struggle against spin was difficult to understand as Rajat Patidar, batting alongside him, smashed the SRH spinners into the stands. He hit 4 sixes in an over bowled by Mayank Markande and finished with 50 off just 20 balls. Markande smashed 5 sixes as he kept the scoreboard moving when Kohli was struggling to get going.\n\nA section of fans questioned Virat Kohli's approach and feared for India's chances in the T20 World Cup, arguing that such an approach, especially after the powerplay, might prove detrimental to Team India. Kohli, who did not play T20I cricket in 2023, returned to the format in January and is in contention to make the T20 World Cup.\n\nVirat Kohli, however, went past 400 runs for the 10th time in his IPL career, extending his lead in the Orange Cap standings. Kohli was similarly criticised for his 113 which came in 72 balls against Rajasthan in Jaipur. Despite Kohli's score, RCB posted only 182 which the Royals chased down in just 16.5 overs.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shahbaz Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202404/virat-kohli-254815215-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=7jxM1.U6fZwTUZ0xRfHPKqkV6ln8tC9k", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "textStart": 172, "textEnd": 179}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

With seven losses from eight games, Bengaluru will in all probability be knocked out of the playoffs race if they lose to Hyderabad.\n\nThe two teams played an extremely high-scoring game in the reverse fixture at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. SRH scored 287/3, the highest team total in the history of T20 franchise cricket. RCB, in reply, came really close with 262/7, ending up losing the game by just 25 runs.\n\nThe game in Hyderabad has all the makings of yet another runfest, especially with the way SRH have been playing. However, here are three factors that the Royal Challengers Bengaluru can have a look at to ensure they avoid the hosts doing the double on them:\n\n#1 Will Jacks to open\n\nAll-rounder Will Jacks showed glimpses of what he is capable of in RCB's heartbreaking loss against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their previous game. He scored 55 runs off 32 balls, but what was more important was the impact he had in the powerplay when he walked out to bat in the third over.\n\nJacks has shown in T20 leagues around the world that his best position is at the top of the order. Just like Travis Head has for the SunRisers, Jacks has the ability to single-handedly demolish the opposition bowling attack and give the Royal Challengers the headstart they need.\n\n#2 Entry-point for spin-hitters\n\nThe likes of Jacks and Cameron Green have been more adept to hit pace rather than spin and that is one area RCB will need to look at while countering the threat from Shahbaz Ahmed and wrist-spinner Mayank Markande.\n\nThe good thing for Bengaluru is that Rajat Patidar looks to be back at his best, especially with the way he tore into KKR spinners in the previous game. They also have Mahipal Lomror, who can tonk the spinners. The key for the visitors will be to get these entry points right to get the best out of their batting resources.\n\n#3 Bowling combinations and plans\n\nRCB tasted decent success to keep the dangerous Sunil Narine at bay during their previous game against KKR and will face a similar threat against SRH in the form of Travis Head. The left-hander already scored a stunning hundred when the two teams met in Bengaluru and is in stupendous form.\n\nThe visitors will need to ensure they try to rock Head early, either by frustrating him with dot balls or by trying to make him uncomfortable with short-pitched deliveries. Lockie Ferguson needs to be used as a middle-overs enforcer and Bengaluru need to find a way to bring in Vijaykumar Vyshak. Cutters into the pitch have been effective in Hyderabad and Vyshak would be extremely handy.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anuj_nitin_prabhu@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Anuj Nitin Prabhu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Chinnaswamy_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

Here's how:\n\nWhat does RCB need, to finish fourth?\n\nRCB needs to win all six of its remaining matches and improve its net run rate to have a chance at making it to the playoffs. Winning all six would give it 14 points, which might be enough depending on other teams' results. It faces Sunrisers Hyderabad next. However, even then, it's not guaranteed. It also needs the current top three teams -- Rajasthan Royals, Kolkata Knight Riders, and SRH -- to win most of its matches. RCB's upcoming matches are against SRH, Gujarat Titans (twice), Punjab Kings, Delhi Capitals, and Chennai Super Kings.\n\nCan RCB finish third?\n\nIn a highly improbable scenario, RCB could finish third on the table if the top three teams suddenly struggle and only manage to win one more match each in their remaining fixtures.\n\nCan RCB afford a loss against SRH and still qualify?\n\nIf RCB loses against SRH, the maximum points it could accumulate would be 12, and that might also be enough for qualification depending on the results of fellow contenders.\n\nLatest on SportstarIPL 2024: Can RCB still qualify for the Indian Permier League Playoffs?

But the most striking aspect of it was, throughout the match they never looked like a bottom-placed team. After the batting unit had done its part, the RCB bowlers took over. The energy levels on the field were top notch as the intensity that was missing in the previous matches was visible on the night. That at one point Karn Sharma bowled with a fielder at slip and silly point, spoke of how a good outing could do a world of good for a side that hasn't tasted a win. Now that they have finally managed to taste it, RCB have the opportunity to play party poopers.\n\nThe ball before Faf du Plessis perished, he did the exact thing. He manufactured room by moving away from the leg-stump and tried to slap rather than cut T Natarajan. The ball was short, but the lack of pace defeated him and he ended up toe-ending the ball. But the RCB skipper was in no mood to eschew the shot. Before the next ball, he shadow-practised the stroke a few times, wound his shoulders, in case those were stiff.The next ball was similar, if anything a bit wider than the previous one. Du Plessis's response was the same, he tried to slap the ball. But this ball was even slower, wider and angled away. So even if he had decoded the change of pace, he had little control of the shot, and hence could not impart any momentum onto the ball. It squirmed off the edge and hung in the air, before compatriot Aiden Markram came under it.\n\nPat Cummins and Virat Kohli will forever be linked by the silence that engulfed Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium when the latter's inside edge made its way to the stumps in the World Cup final. Kohli was biding his time in the hope of a late assault on that day and would have been peeved to be dismissed while going for only a single. The situation was different at Uppal on Thursday with Royal Challengers Bengaluru off to somewhat of a flier when the Sunrisers Hyderabad skipper came on to bowl the third over. Those fluid wrists came into play on the first ball as the Aussie pace spearhead's length ball was flicked over mid-wicket for a four. The next one, a length ball outside off, was lofted over cover. T Natarajan's first ball was whipped between mid-on and mid-wicket for another boundary, before Cummins brought on Kohli's perceived kryptonite, spin in the form of Shahbaz Ahmed and Mayank Markande, to rein him in.\n\nPat Cummins's masterclass on how to bowl a T20 over\n\nWatch the 12th over replay if you can. Pat Cummins with a masterclass on how to bowl in T20. As a captain, Cummins had just seen his young spinner Mayank Markande being smashed for four consecutive sixes by Rajat Patidar in the 11th over and the score zoomed to 127 for 2. As ever, Cummins took on the responsibility to bowl the pressure over. The first was a pacy length ball to Patidar that was punched to long-off for a single. Next one was a back of length and Kohli punched it hard but could only get a single to long-off. Then began the changes. A yorker came and Patidar could only dig it out for a single. Kohli was served a slower off cutter into the turf and short, and the mistimed pull fetched just another single. Next ball was another slower but of different nature - this one much fuller and dipping like an off-break at Patidar who pushed it for a single. What now to Kohli for the final ball.. Yorker or another slower one? It was the change of pace again, but a slower bouncer and just a single again. Just 6 runs after a flood of runs. Unsurprisingly, Patidar fell next over, trying to get a maximum and holing out at the boundary off Jaydev Unadkat.\n\nPatidar takes over the mantle\n\nWith Virat Kohli reduced, or choosing, to milking spinners, it came upon Rajat Patidar to take them down. The Madhya Pradesh batsman, who hd recently returned among runs after a long barren run, developed a special liking for Mayank Markande, after the spinner had deceived Will Jacks with a delightful change of pace. Patidar had signalled his intentions by smashing Shahbaz Ahmed back over his head off the second ball he faced. Markande was taken for five sixes - four in succession in the 11th over. All but one of them were hit in the arc between the sightscreen and wide long-off. When Markande dropped short, Patidar found the stands behind cow corner. The modest pace of Jaydev Unadkat was given similar treatment. Kohli's struggles at the other end forced Patidar to fall on the sword as there was hardly any impetus from the other end, Unadkat getting the vital breakthrough.\n\nSlow and steady wins Unadkat the race\n\nJaydev Unadkat could be no more than a utility bowler. He doesn't invoke fear in batsmen, he does not instigate video analysts to spend hours decoding his variations, he does not pounce into batsmen's nightmares. But what he has is the exceptional skill to vary his pace, a reason he always commands a handsome sum on the auction day. He has the whole assortment -- off-cutter, back-of-the-hand one, and leg-cutter. His pet slower ball this season has been the slow bouncer, which he delivers from around the stumps to the right-hander and like an off-cutter. He bangs them onto the turf, whips up good bounce. The Virat Kohli wicket ball seamed away a tad from him. It was the slight deviation off the surface that stripped Kohli of the power he wanted to generate. The RCB totem lost his balance in search of power and ended up bungling to deep square leg. Unadkat struck the victory pose. Why not? He had just dismissed Kohli for the first time in the league.\n\nA story of what if\n\nRight from the player auctions to now, one of the biggest talking points with regards to RCB has been the lack of quality spinners in their ranks. Apart from Karn Sharma and Glenn Maxwell, they have relied on Mahipal Lomror, Will Jacks to fill their quota. As the tournament progresses, this glaring hole will be exploited by opponents and Swapnil Singh showed why they could have added a world-class spinner to their kitty. With SRH getting another strong start, he removed Aiden Markram with a full-toss, which the batsman missed totally to be given out lbw. Then in the same over, despite Heinrich Klaasen going after him straight away, he had the courage to slow it down and give it some air.

The 30-year-old smashed a 19-ball fifty for RCB against SRH at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Thursday, April 25. The Maharashtra star hit 5 sixes in his blazing knock as he gave the SunRisers a taste of their own medicine after Faf du Plessis won the toss and opted to bat.\n\nRajat Patidar smashed it to all parts of the ground, hitting 5 sixes and 2 boundaries as he took down Mayank Markande. Rajat hit Markande for 4 sixes in the 11th over of the match, flaunting his incredible striking ability against leg-spin.\n\nSRH vs RCB: Updates | Scorecard\n\nPatidar kept it simple and hit the ball straight over the bowler's head for as many as three times in the over before the SRH spinner tried to outfox him by bowling wide. Rajat, however, was alert as he adjusted while dancing down the track and hit one over the cover boundary.\n\nRajat Patidar has hit 20 sixes against leg-spinners in the IPL at a strike rate of over 200 in the IPL and SRH went for the wrong match-up against the RCB star. Rajat was crucial to RCB keeping the scoring rate going after the powerplay as Virat Kohli, his batting partner, struggled to get going against the spinners, during their 65-run stand.\n\nAt one stage, Rajat Patidar was looking good to break Chris Gayle's IPL record for the fastest fifty by an RCB batter. However, he got to the milestone in 2 balls more than the former West Indies big-hitter.\n\nHowever, Rajat Patidar was not able to convert his fifty into a bigger knock as he fell to Jaydev Unadkat in the 12th over, hitting a full-toss straight into the hands of the deep fine-leg fielder.\n\nRajat Patidar is looking to return to peak form in IPL 2024 after having had a horror run in his maiden Test series against England in February-March.\n\nIn his debut match in Visakhapatnam, Patidar showed a glimmer of promise with a score of 32 runs in the first innings but failed to build on this start in subsequent matches. His performance in the third Test at Ranchi was particularly underwhelming, where he managed only 17 runs off 42 balls before being dismissed. This pattern of low scores continued throughout the series, culminating in a total of just 63 runs across five innings, averaging a meagre 12.60.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType":

Let's take a look at how the pitch of the stadium is likely to behave.\n\nPitches at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium are known for being batting-friendly. Imagine playing on a level pitch with consistent bounce, as Sunrisers Hyderabad did against Mumbai Indians. The match saw a combined total of over 500 runs! They amassed an incredible 277 runs!

The clash, hosted at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, witnessed Kohli's struggle despite his recent form in the tournament.\n\nAP\n\nInitially showing promise, Kohli's innings failed to maintain momentum after RCB lost two wickets. While his teammate Rajat Patidar surged ahead, Kohli seemed to retreat, eventually falling prey to Jaydev Unadkat's slower ball after scoring a half-century. His attempt to pull the delivery lacked power, leading to his dismissal, caught by Abdul Samad.\n\nKohli's 51-run contribution off 43 balls, with a strike rate of just 118, disappointed fans, who expected a more dynamic performance. Though he managed to hit four fours and a six, his exit in the 15th over left RCB struggling at 140/5.\n\nRajat Patidar's blistering half-century off just 19 balls stood in stark contrast to Kohli's innings, highlighting the necessity for a more aggressive approach. Kohli's departure, courtesy of SRH's Jaydev Unadkat, only amplified the criticism surrounding his performance.\n\nBCCI\n\nTwitter erupted with criticism towards Kohli's slow-paced innings, with fans expressing dissatisfaction over his inability to capitalize on the team's momentum. Many felt that had Kohli accelerated earlier, RCB could have secured an additional 10-15 runs.\n\nDespite Kohli's subdued performance, RCB still achieved a commendable total of 206 runs against SRH at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. However, fans' discontent with Kohli's innings persisted, underscoring their desire for dynamic and aggressive cricket in the fast-paced T20 format.", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaydev_Unadkat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaydev Unadkat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_(Indian_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdul Samad (Indian cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2024/Apr/ipiccy_image---2024-04-25T224507540_662a95002cd50.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

The 41st game of the tournament is underway at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad between RCB vs SRH.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru bowlers are all over the Sunrisers Hyderabad batters in their home ground, the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. The spinners have been magnificent with the ball and have kept their team at the top.\n\nAfter Swapnil Singh took two wickets, Karn Sharma added his name to the wickets tally. SRH all-rounder Nitish Reddy was looking to settle at the crease, but the RCB spinner had the better of him and provided his team with a crucial breakthrough.\n\nDuring the second ball of the 8th over, Karn Sharma bowled a tossed-up delivery in the middle. Nitish Reddy went for a big reverse sweep but got beaten by the leg break. The ball went on to crash into the top of the off stump to send the batter packing at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nNitish Reddy scored just 13 runs off 13 balls. His wicket saw Sunrisers Hyderabad lose their fifth wicket, leaving them reeling at 69/5. The leg-spinner has been bowling magnificently well in the ongoing game, putting the batters under pressure while chasing a total of over 200 runs.\n\nKarn Sharma didn't stop there as after that, he removed Abdul Samad as well in the the next over that he bowled. The leg-spinner outfoxed the batter and made sure that he helped his team get the 6th wicket with the ball at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\n\nKarn Sharma bowled a length ball on the leg stump, to which Abdul Samad tried to work it through the on-side. The ball gripped and turned and took the leading edge as the ball was safely pouched by the bowler. The batter managed just 10 runs off 6 balls.\n\nRajat Patidar, who played a brutal innings of 50 runs off 20 balls, talked about his knock and said that he was planning his innings and was taking ball by ball. He also opened up about his 4 sixes against Mayank Markande, saying that he tried to maximize the over.\n\nRajat Patidar also talked about the conditions, stating that his bowlers should use slower balls on the wicket. Speaking to broadcasters, he explained:\n\n\"I think the surface is double-paced, especially for fast bowlers. We can use cutters well on this wicket. The spinners will try to bowl back of a length as much as possible. I was just planning my innings, I was not thinking about century. (4 consecutive sixes vs Markande) It was not a plan, but I started well in that over; I was trying to maximise.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karn Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajat_Patidar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajat Patidar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapnil_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swapnil Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayank_Markande", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayank Markande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/NitishReddycastledbyKarnSharma.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

With the ball, the off-spinner has picked up just one wicket from two innings.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024 Orange Cap", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Sundar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Sundar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1714052429721_sundar.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Sitting rock-bottom in the league, all the odds are against Virat Kohli and his teammates.\n\nHowever, former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed optimism about Bengaluru's chances in the ongoing IPL 2024 ahead of their match against SRH at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on April 25, Thursday. He acknowledged the significant challenge they face in reaching the playoffs from their current position. Despite being led by Faf du Plessis, the Challengers have struggled throughout the tournament.\n\n\"Bengaluru is not yet out. Of course, it's extremely difficult. They are at the bottom of the table. In fact, this has become the joint-worst season in their history, that you have played so many chances and have only two points,\" Chopra said.\n\nAccording to Chopra, with only one victory in eight matches, this season marks RCB's \"joint-worst\" performance in IPL history. They find themselves at the bottom of the table after suffering six consecutive defeats following their solitary win against PBKS in Bengaluru.\n\n\"However, there are two ways of playing. One is to accept defeat. This team will not accept defeat. They know how to fight and have a very loyal fan base. At times you play for the respect of your fans, that they gave you love and you will give them respect. In any case, you play to win and you give your best. You will expect that from this team,\" Chopra added.\n\nNevertheless, Chopra expressed faith in RCB's ability to stage a comeback, emphasizing their track record in such situations. He highlighted the importance of winning matches for their loyal fanbase, who have stood by them through thick and thin.\n\nIn the upcoming South Indian derby against Hyderabad, Bengaluru will face a confident Sunrisers side. The Orange Army has been in stellar form this season, winning five out of seven matches and setting numerous records along the way.\n\nIn their previous encounter, RCB narrowly lost by 25 runs while chasing down the highest total in IPL history, which was 287 runs.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashwat_nishant@news24online.com", "name": "Shashwat Nishant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Virat-Kohli-RCB-vs-SRH.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 575, "textEnd": 583}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The visitors opted to bat first, which seemed to be the right choice as the pitch was predicted to deteriorate later on in the match.\n\nOn the back of great fifties from Indian batters Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar, the side was able to post a competitive score of 206/7 in their 20 overs. An amazing cameo from Cameron Green made sure that his side went past the 200-mark in their innings. Jaydev Unadkat bowled an excellent spell as he grabbed four wickets and gave away just 30 runs in his four overs.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad did not have a great response with the bat as they lost Travis Head in the first over itself. They lost three more in the powerplay as the RCB bowlers started to dominate the opposition batters. The other batters gave away their wickets cheaply in an attempt to keep attacking and maintain the required run rate for the chase. In the end, Royal Challengers Bengaluru finally returned to winning ways.\n\nOver the past few games for Hyderabad, the openers have been providing them the base for a massive total. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma's attacking approach often demoralizes the opposition bowlers. In their previous game against Delhi Capitals, they made 125 runs inside the powerplay itself.\n\nThe middle order has come into question after their dismal performance in the past few games. Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen have not had the same impetus as the team management would have expected from them. Shahbaz Ahmed and Nitish Kumar Reddy have bailed out the side on a few occasions. But the overseas batting duo might have to be accountable for their respective wickets after such a loss.\n\nOnly a few years back, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was considered amongst the best bowlers in the country. But nowadays, the veteran pacer doesn't get recognition within his own team, as he bowled a solitary over in the encounter on Thursday.\n\nThe UP-born pacer is known as the 'Swing King' but has been unable to bring back his old form to this edition of the Indian Premier League. The team management should back the pacer and should start bowling him more especially in the powerplay overs. If he finds his mojo back, he can scalp wickets for fun inside the first six overs.\n\nAiden Markram has not had an ideal 2024 campaign with the bat. Despite his sole fifty in the game against the Mumbai Indians, the right-handed batter has struggled to play well for the franchise. Moreover, he has not been bowling this season and his place in the side has now come into question.\n\nThe 2016 winners have an option of picking Glenn Phillips in their line-up and would be looking at that ahead of their next game against Chennai Super Kings. The batting all-rounder has a variety of shots up his sleeve and can also chip in with some overs with the ball, which might prove to be handy in the crucial stages of the game.", "source": {"uri":

In his first over, he conceded just four runs and castled Nitish Reddy for 13 to leave SRH five down for 69 in the eighth over. And in his next over, he struck again to send back Samad and put RCB in the driver's seat.\n\nThe RCB spinner dismissed Samad on the very first ball of the tenth over. It was a length ball on the pads from the leg-spinner and Samad tried to play on the leg-side. However, the ball turned at the last moment. As a result, Samad ended up miscuing his shot towards the bowler. Karn Sharma reacted quickly and dived to his right side to take a fine catch. It was followed by an interesting reaction by SRH CEO Kavya Maran who looked absolutely surprised over the shot from Samad.\n\nEarlier in the game, half-centuries from Rajat Patidar and Virat Kohli helped RCB post a competitive total of 206/7 in the allotted 20 overs. Patidar scored a whirlwind 19-ball fifty while Kohli scored 51 runs off 43 balls. Cameron Green also played a crucial knock of 37 not out to take RCB to a 200-plus total. For SRH, Jaydev Unadkat picked up three wickets while T Natarajan claimed two.\n\n\"I think the surface is double-paced, especially for fast bowlers. We can use cutters well on this wicket.

Despite the knock going in vain, the side will be positive seeing the skipper thriving with the bat despite the added responsibility as a skipper.\n\nRishabh Pant: The DC skipper continues to impress everyone since his long-awaited return to competitive cricket. His recent knock against Gujarat Titans where he scored 88 in just 43 balls shows that he is still that good that he is third in the run-scoring charts.\n\nSai Sudarshan: The young left-hander continues to showcase his talent and why he deserves to be part of the national team. Despite being asked to play as an opener or even at number three, he seems unfazed and his latest knock against DC where he scored 65 runs in 39 balls is evidence of his talent in the big stages. c\n\nTravis Head: The game against RCB is very likely a one-off as the opposition came up against him with his weakness that is the spinners and he fell very early after scoring just one run. But he will look to get back amongst the runs as he is now the fifth-highest run-scorer in the IPL 2024.\n\nJasprit Bumrah: Mumbai's ace in the hole, Bumrah has been outstanding as he keeps reaching new highs and continues to dominate the batters in a season where batting has gone on a whole new level.\n\nYuzuvendra Chahal: The experienced leg-spinner who seems to be out of favour with the national side, showcases why he is among the best Indian spinners as he also reached the 200-wicket milestone, the first bowler in the IPL to reach the feat.\n\nHarshal Patel: Despite having a poor start to the season, Harshal seems to have turned his fortunes around as he is now the third-highest wicket-taker of the season despite PBKS continuing to struggle with close losses through the 2024 edition.\n\nKuldeep Yadav: The left-arm wrist spinner has been tested on various occasions, especially against SRH but he showed why he is amongst the top spinners of the tournament as he has already racked up 12 wickets in just six games,\n\nT Natarajan: The left-arm pacer has jumped up to the fifth spot in the wicket-taking charts after taking two wickets against RCB. He continues to show his class by bowling in all three phases of the game and picking wickets while not giving away too many runs as well.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Natarajan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

Photograph: BCCI\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru skipper Faf du Plessis was a relieved man after his team snapped a six-game losing streak with a 35-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL in Hyderabad on Thursday.\n\n\"Last two games, we've shown great signs of fight. SRH game was 270 plus, we got 260. KKR game as well - 1 run. We've been close for a while, but you need to win matches to get confidence as a group. Will sleep easier tonight.\"\n\n\"You can't speak confidence into the group, can't fake confidence into the group. Only thing that gives confidence is performances,\" he said at the post match presentation ceremony.\n\nWhile Virat Kohli has been the top-scorer for them, Du Plessis is happy that other batters are too getting back amongst runs.\n\n\"The competition is so strong, the teams are so strong that you'll get hurt if you're not at 100 percent. More guys are scoring runs now. First half of the tournament only Virat was scoring runs. Greeny scoring runs now will be massive for him.\"\n\nChasing 207, SRH's ultra aggressive approach with the bat backfired as they were 69-5 in 8th over and couldn't recover thereafter.\n\n\"Not an ideal night. Few over par with the ball and unfortunately lost a few wickets throughout our innings. We were gonna bat first, it seems to be working for us. Before the last few wins, we were thinking that we were a bowl-first team,\" Pat Cummins, SRH captain, said.\n\n\"The boys have been going really well, it's T20 cricket, you are not going to win every game. Don't dwell on this too much.\"\n\nTaking about their high risk and high reward approach with the bat, Cummins said: \"I think it's our strong suit. It's not going to work every game. One or two games where it hasn't gone our way at the start, we still managed to get a good total. Still think this is the way forward for our boys.\"\n\nIPL 2024", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/cricket/2024/apr/25faf-quotes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Mighty impressed with the free-scoring SRH side led by World Cup-winner Pat Cummins, legendary Pakistani pacer Wasim Akram has sympathised with the premier bowlers plying their trade in the cash-rich league.\n\nChampions in the 2016 edition of the IPL, Sunrisers Hyderabad, shattered their own record by posting the highest-ever total in the history of the league this season. In match No.8 of the IPL 2024, Abhishek Sharma-starrer SRH smashed a record-setting 277/3 in 20 overs against Mumbai Indians. After 22 games, SRH hammered Royal Challengers Bengaluru bowlers by registering the IPL record with a massive total of 287/3 in 20 overs. Sunrisers Hyderabad batters smashed 22 sixes against RCB - the most by any team in the IPL.\n\nALSO READ: From one MS to another, Marcus Stoinis takes leaf out of Dhoni to ace record chase vs CSK:'He said in big games...'\n\nSpeaking to Sportskeeda ahead of SRH's rematch with RCB, former Pakistan skipper Akram opined that bowlers are getting destroyed in the ongoing season of the IPL. \"Thank God, I am not playing cricket in this era. I mean they are scoring 270 in 20 overs. It's like 450 or 500 in a 50-over game. If it happened once, it was okay, but this has happened three-four times, which shows how strong the batting is. It is illegal to score 100 runs in 5 overs. How can this happen? Even if you bowl full-tosses, it is tough to do it. For bowlers, it has become like take money and get destroyed here. I feel for the bowlers in this format,\" Akram said.\n\nThe former Pakistan captain branded SRH as the most destructive side in franchise cricket. The fast-bowling icon also reserved special praise for South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen. SRH batter Klaasen has smashed 268 runs in seven matches this season. \"Heinrich Klaasen is one of my favourite players in the world if you talk about white-ball cricket. His ability to hit sixes is incredible. Abdul Samad is doing a good job as a finisher. He is playing his role well.

As their respective teams, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), prepared to lock horns in a crucial IPL 2024 encounter, the camaraderie between these two legends transcended boundaries, reminding us of the true spirit of the game.\n\nThe scene was set during a joint practice session on the eve of the highly anticipated clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.

While SRH, led by the astute Cummins, have been riding a wave of dominance, occupying the third spot on the points table, RCB's campaign has been marred by inconsistency, leaving them languishing at the bottom.\n\nAs the two teams take the field, all eyes will be on Kohli and Cummins, whose performances could potentially shape the outcome of the match and, by extension, the complexion of the entire tournament. However, regardless of the result, their heartwarming exchange serves as a testament to the enduring spirit of sportsmanship that lies at the heart of the gentleman's game.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummins", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/04/25/1397042-babar.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Patidar was padded up as the next batter at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday, April 25.\n\nMidway through the final powerplay over by T Natarajan, ace batter Virat Kohli dispatched a full delivery for a six to the long-on boundary. The shot was all class as Kohli just timed the ball to perfection.\n\nPatidar got up from his seat in the dugout, nonchalantly took the catch, and returned the ball before returning to his seat. His effort even drew a pat on the back by teammate Glenn Maxwell.\n\nHave a look at the catch right here (0:05 onwards):\n\nRajat Patidar is a relatively reliable fielder, having taken a number of good catches in the field over the course of his career. He had taken a sharp catch at short leg to dismiss Ben Duckett on his Test debut in Vizag, a couple of months ago.\n\nRajat Patidar scored a sublime fifty to boost RCB's innings\n\nAfter his brief outing beyond the boundary, Patidar had to come out to bat soon after. The right-handed batter came out to bat in the eighth over of the innings following Will Jacks' dismissal.\n\nPatidar carried on from his sublime knock at Eden Gardens against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). On that occasion, he scored 52 runs off 23 deliveries, and this time he carried on his onslaught just when RCB needed a push in the middle overs.\n\nRajat Patidar ended up scoring 50 runs off 20 deliveries, with two fours and a six at a strike rate of 250. RCB were placed at 130-3 in the 13th over after he holed out to the deep off Jaydev Unadkat's bowling in his 100th IPL appearance.\n\nHis knock has set up a brilliant platform for the likes of Caemron Green and Dinesh Karthik to come in and capitalize.

Since then he also made the move to Lucknow Super Giants when he was picked at the 2023 auctions.\n\nInterestingly, he made his debut for Baroda at just 14 years old. As the years went by, he was also the highest-run scorer for the side in the 2017-18 season with 565 runs in six games, averaging at 62.77.\n\nStay updated with the latest from IPL 2024, including top contenders for the IPL 2024 Orange Cap and IPL 2024 Purple Cap.

Among the wickets included the likes of Sheldon Jackson and Indian international Cheteshwar Pujara.\n\nHe then switched to playing for Uttarakhand in the 2021-22 domestic season but has not made much of an impact since then.\n\nSwapnil was stuck on the bench for LSG when the likes of Ravi Bishnoi and others took up the spinner's slot in the starting XI and was subsequently released by the franchise.\n\nREAD MORE: Strike-rate Concerns for Virat Kohli as RCB Star Unable to Accelerate Though Middle Overs vs SRH\n\nRCB however, showed faith in the 33-year-old and now has repaid in dividends as they are on the verge of clinching a momentum-shifting win over the dangerous SRH side.\n\nCoincidentally, the all-rounder was in the race to be picked for India's U19 World Cup squad in 2008 which was led by Virat Kohli but failed to make the cut. However, he now shares the pitch with the RCB man and has been impactful with the bat scoring 12 runs in six balls and taking the key wickets of the South African duo, Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen.\n\nREAD MORE: IPL 2024: Delhi Capitals Rope in Gulbadin Naib as Mitchell Marsh Replacement\n\nDespite being in the final stretch of his career, Swapnil continues to show the world his skills

In fact, he had not played a T20 International for over 15 months until February, having also skipped IPL last year. Considering the ever-changing demands of the format, the 30-year-old had remarkably had little game time.\n\nThat, however, didn't stop Sunrisers Hyderabad from bidding a whopping \u20b920.5 crore for his services, even appointing him captain. It was a gamble, especially for a side that hadn't gone past the league stage in the previous three seasons. But with half their league games in IPL 2024 done, it's safe to say the punt taken on Cummins has worked. The Sunrisers, with 10 points, will play five of their last seven league games at home and are strong contenders to make the playoffs.\n\nFor all the talk around his relative inexperience in T20s, Cummins's qualities as skipper and player have been undeniable all along. He led Australia to the World Test Championship title in June last year, following it up with a sensational triumph over India in the ODI World Cup final five months later. His tactical masterclass and audacious leadership in that game will likely remain one of the lasting memories of that tournament.\n\nIn IPL 2024, we are witnessing his SRH revolutionise T20 batting with an all-guns-blazing approach. They have broken the record for the highest team total in IPL twice, with a staggering three 260-plus scores. And Cummins has been a key driving force behind this change.\n\n\"Everyone's terrified when they come up against us and we're going to blow some teams out of the water before they have even walked out on the field,\" he had told his teammates after they smashed 287 runs while beating Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).\n\n\"We've seen the freedom that SRH are playing with,\" former Australia captain Aaron Finch said on Star Sports. \"Pat and coach Dan Vettori have a great relationship as well. They don't get emotional around the result of a game. Whether it's a World Cup, the Big Bash or any other T20 competition, you sit down and map out how you think you're going to win it. And you have to be prepared to stay the course because it's so volatile. From Australia's point of view and SRH's too, Pat has been a wonderful leader. Just the calmness that he brings to a group. Also, being a bowler, he can sympathise with a bowler when it's not going well. He knows what to say at the right time.\"\n\nWith the ball too Cummins has been a cut above the rest. He's picked nine wickets in seven games. But it's his economy rate of 8.00 that's played a huge role in his side's success. Among pacers who have played five or more games this season, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult and Matheesha Pathirana have been more frugal, but the point is that SRH's games have seen higher scores. Their belligerence with the bat has compelled oppositions to come hard at them, which has resulted in jaw-dropping run fests. Through it all, even as most of SRH's bowlers have gone at over 10 an over, Cummins has been the one to pull things back consistently. The fast bowler has conceded more than nine runs an over in just one game (3/43 against RCB, which also ended in victory).\n\nThe Impact Player rule has arguably been the biggest talking point so far this season. With Cummins in charge, SRH have emerged trailblazers in the way they have used it to dominate with the bat. The flip side to this rule is a lack of respite for the bowlers, but in that sense too, the Aussie star has shown his class by adapting to different situations.\n\nWe're moving towards the business end of IPL and Cummins, who's going through the most glittering phase of his career, will surely believe he can take another of his teams all the way.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC World Test Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bash_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bash League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Finch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Finch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheesha_Pathirana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matheesha Pathirana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Boult", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Boult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/24/1600x900/PTI04-15-2024-000361B-0_1713977728780_1713977969654.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Cummins became the second-most expensive player in the history of the IPL as he was roped in for Rs 20.50 crore by SRH in the auction and was soon announced captain of the side. Cummins leading the side claimed an 'aggressive start' to the season and so far, has proved his words right.\n\nIn seven matches Hyderabad have won five matches with the batter putting up a show with the bat.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad broke their own record for the highest IPL total with a sensational 287 for three against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on April 15. SRH's total is also the second highest T20 cricket, only behind Nepal's 314/3 against Mongolia in 2023.\n\n\"We've already seen, so far, the freedom that SRH is playing with, and I think, whether it's a World Cup, whether it's the Big Bash or any other T20 competition, you sit down and you map out how you think you're going to win it,\" said Aaron Finch on Star Sports Press Room.\n\n\"And you have to be prepared because it's so volatile. From Australia's point of view and SRH's too, Pat has been a wonderful leader. I think the calmness that he brings to a group and also being a bowler, he can sympathize with a bowler when it's not going well. He knows what to say at the right time. And I know from my experience as a batsman that when you speak to bowlers, sometimes you don't understand why you bowled that ball at that stage. And there's more to it than just a poorly executed delivery or maybe the plan was wrong. So, I think Pat's got that great understanding of what it takes to be a bowler in that situation. So, he gets through to them a lot easier,\" he added.\n\nSRH were captained by Aiden Markram previously, but finished bottom of the points table in IPL 2023, returning with just four wins from 14 matches. But Cummins had a magnificent 2023, which boosted his leadership credentials - winning the World Test Championship (WTC), retaining the Ashes in England, and claiming a record sixth Men's ODI World Cup as captain of Australia.\n\nAaron Finch also spoke on the possibility of Cummins leading the Australian T20 World Cup squad and Jake Fraser-McGurk's inclusion in the squad and said, \"Depending on Mitch Marsh and his fitness, he's obviously out at the moment because of his quad or his hamstring. I'm not 100% sure. But if he's fit, he will captain the side in my opinion. And Australian cricket is really mindful of the load on Pat Cummins as a player and as a leader.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly time-consuming to be a captain of an international team and a franchise for that matter. So, the fact that he's doing Test cricket, ODI cricket, IPL, that's an incredible load as well as playing three formats of the game and expecting to be at your absolute best day in, day out, which he has been for the last couple of years.\"", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Finch", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Finch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bash_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bash League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC World Test Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Marsh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Marsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ashes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www-greaterkashmir-com.imagibyte.sortdcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20231119628L-scaled-e1713811182758.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 694, "textEnd": 702}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

SRH game was 270 plus, we got 260. KKR game as well - 1 run. We've been close for a while, but you need to win matches to get confidence as a group. Will sleep easier tonight.\n\n\"You can't speak confidence into the group, can't fake confidence into the group. Only thing that gives confidence is performances,\" he said at the post match presentation ceremony.\n\nWhile Virat Kohli has been the top-scorer for them, Du Plessis is happy that other batters are too getting back amongst runs.\n\n\"The competition is so strong, the teams are so strong that you'll get hurt if you're not at 100 percent. More guys are scoring runs now. First half of the tournament only Virat was scoring runs. Greeny scoring runs now will be massive for him.\" Chasing 207, SRH's ultra aggressive approach with the bat backfired as they were 69-5 in 8th over and couldn't recover thereafter.\n\n\"Not an ideal night. Few over par with the ball and unfortunately lost a few wickets throughout our innings. We were gonna bat first, it seems to be working for us. Before the last few wins, we were thinking that we were a bowl-first team,\" Pat Cummins, SRH captain, said.\n\n\"The boys have been going really well, it's T20 cricket, you are not going to win every game. Don't dwell on this too much.\" Taking about their high risk and high reward approach with the bat, Cummins said: \"I think it's our strong suit. It's not going to work every game. One or two games where it hasn't gone our way at the start, we still managed to get a good total.

He won the ICC Men's Cricketer of the Year for his incredible performances and leadership displays last year.

Cummins showed that he is just as good as a father as he is a captain by looking after his son Albie Boston Cummins during flight.\n\nIn October, 2021, Pat Cummins and his then-fiancee Becky Boston welcomed their newborn Albie Boston Cummins, before the couple exchanged vows on August 1, 2022.\n\nPat Cummins was signed for INR 20.5 crore at the IPL 2024 auctions by Sunrisers Hyderabad, making him the first player ever in the history of the league to be sold for INR 20 crore or more.

Cummins became the second-most expensive player in the history of the IPL as he was roped in for Rs 20.50 crore by SRH in the auction and was soon announced captain of the side. Cummins leading the side claimed an 'aggressive start' to the season and so far, has proved his words right.\n\nIn seven matches Hyderabad have won five matches with the batter putting up a show with the bat.\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad broke their own record for the highest IPL total with a sensational 287 for three against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on April 15. SRH's total is also the second highest T20 cricket, only behind Nepal's 314/3 against Mongolia in 2023.\n\n\"We've already seen, so far, the freedom that SRH is playing with, and I think, whether it's a World Cup, whether it's the Big Bash or any other T20 competition, you sit down and you map out how you think you're going to win it,\" said Aaron Finch on Star Sports Press Room.\n\n\"And you have to be prepared because it's so volatile. From Australia's point of view and SRH's too, Pat has been a wonderful leader. I think the calmness that he brings to a group and also being a bowler, he can sympathize with a bowler when it's not going well. He knows what to say at the right time. And I know from my experience as a batsman that when you speak to bowlers, sometimes you don't understand why you bowled that ball at that stage. And there's more to it than just a poorly executed delivery or maybe the plan was wrong. So, I think Pat's got that great understanding of what it takes to be a bowler in that situation. So, he gets through to them a lot easier,\" he added.\n\nSRH were captained by Aiden Markram previously, but finished bottom of the points table in IPL 2023, returning with just four wins from 14 matches. But Cummins had a magnificent 2023, which boosted his leadership credentials - winning the World Test Championship (WTC), retaining the Ashes in England, and claiming a record sixth Men's ODI World Cup as captain of Australia.\n\nAaron Finch also spoke on the possibility of Cummins leading the Australian T20 World Cup squad and Jake Fraser-McGurk's inclusion in the squad and said, \"Depending on Mitch Marsh and his fitness, he's obviously out at the moment because of his quad or his hamstring. I'm not 100% sure. But if he's fit, he will captain the side in my opinion. And Australian cricket is really mindful of the load on Pat Cummins as a player and as a leader.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly time-consuming to be a captain of an international team and a franchise for that matter. So, the fact that he's doing Test cricket, ODI cricket, IPL, that's an incredible load as well as playing three formats of the game and expecting to be at your absolute best day in, day out, which he has been for the last couple of years.\"\n\nAaron Finch also advocated for the inclusion of young Australian talent Jake Fraser-McGurk, who has been performing really well for the Delhi Capitals. Fraser-McGurk smashed a 15-ball fifty, also the fastest half-century by a DC batter in IPL against SRH on April 20. He has so far scored 140 in three matches averaging 46.67.\n\n\"In terms of Jake Fraser-McGurk, Australia has got some seriously tough selection questions when they're picking their squad in the next week or so. I know that they're meeting later in the week to have their initial meeting. They'll probably have two or three to go through the squad and dissect everything. But his name will be well and truly on the table, and there'll be some nervous guys around, I reckon, waiting for that squad to be announced because there are so many players, so much talent in Australian cricket at the moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Never before the 265-mark was breached in the IPL before. But in the first four weeks, the mark was breached by two different teams on four occasions. SunRisers Hyderabad have been at the forefront of big scores in the IPL 2024. They have so far scored 287/3 (vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru), 277/3 (vs Mumbai Indians) and 266/7 (vs Delhi Capitals). Kolkata Knight Riders scored 272/7 (vs Delhi Capitals).\n\nIn the match against Delhi Capitals, SRH scored a world record 125 in six overs with Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma dealing only in boundaries. SRH breached the 100-run mark in just five overs.\n\n\"Scoring 100 in five overs is illegal. Even if you bowl full toss, that can't happen. You are paying the bowlers to get hit. I do feel for the bowlers in this format. But it is what it is. Bowlers have to think outside the box. Scoring 100 in five overs is unreal,\" Wasim Akram said on Sportskeeda\n\n\"(Speaking about SRH) We all love Australians, the way they play. Who says fast bowler can lead well. It is a different matter, when Pakistan made a fast bowler a captain (Shaheen Afridi). Then SRH have Travis Head, another dangerous player. Don't in any league there is a more fearsome batting unit than SRH's. Heinrich Klaasen is one of my favourite players in T20 cricket. He can hit sixes on any ball. Abdul Samad is a great finisher. That is the reason why SRH is at No. 2. Pat Cummins' captaincy has calmed the team.\n\n\"Scoring 270 plus is just too much. It's like scoring 500 in a 50-over game. Thank God I am not bowling. It shows how cricket has changed. Boundaries are less but grounds are same for 30 years.

He has always ensured that he has a nutritious diet.\n\nIn the IPL 2024, ahead of the match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Virat Kohli was seen on the ground eating dry fruits. This happened during a practice session at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on April 25, a day before the teams were scheduled to clash for the second time this season.\n\nThe previous match between these two teams in Bengaluru had been a record-breaking game, and the anticipation for this rematch was high. A video shared by RCB's official social media showed Kohli and Australian cricketer Pat Cummins interacting in a friendly manner. Cummins approached Kohli, who was seated on the ground, both wearing their pads. However, what caught the attention of the viewers was Kohli's snack choice -- dry fruits -- which he had brought in a sizeable container.\n\nNetizens expressed their admiration for Kohli's dedication to his diet, recognizing that his choice of a healthy snack like dry fruits is part of his commitment to maintaining fitness and performance levels. The video sparked a flurry of reactions, with many fans praising Kohli's disciplined lifestyle and some humorously imagining his competitive spirit, equating his consumption of dry fruits with the 'appetite' he would bring to the game against the bowlers of SRH.\n\nThe comments varied, with one user jokingly saying, \"Tomorrow Virat will eat the bowler like he is eating dry fruits now,\" showing enthusiasm for Kohli's performance in the upcoming game. Another user inquired about what specific dry fruits Kohli was consuming, sparking a thread of guesses ranging from dates to walnuts and even light-hearted speculation about eating 'the opposition's careers'.\n\nThis social media moment highlights how fans engage with their favorite athletes, not just around their performances but also their off-field habits and lifestyle choices. The mix of humor, admiration, and curiosity in the comments is an example to how much fans pay attention to the details of athletes' lives, seeing them as role models for fitness and health, as well as for their sportsmanship and skills on the field.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Vegetarianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Vegetarianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Veganism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Veganism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Durian", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Durian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/04/virat2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 386, "textEnd": 394}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 86, "relevance": 1}

Neither has he captained any IPL side or Australia in T20Is before but had proven his leadership for Australia in other formats.\n\nHowever, leading a country and a franchise is comparing oranges to apples. Leading Australia where he has known his players for the majority of his career is quite different from leading an IPL side where he has to adapt and understand the skill sets of players sometimes he is unaware of in a short space of time. But all speculations were put to rest once the tournament started.\n\n\"Pat is just a calming influence and very well prepared. His performances always have a high standard and he has a strong ability to read the game,\" Head Coach Daniel Vettori would say.\n\n\"He likes to work with the other bowlers and coaches. There is a real collaborative style about him. It worked well in the IPL so far...we had some pressure situations with the ball having to defend totals when the teams were coming hard at us but his calming presence just helps everyone through that. \" Vettori revealed Cummins' captaincy method.\n\nVettori who has also worked in the Australian coaching staff with Cummins would say, \"Very similar (Style of captaincy to how he leads Australia). I think he gets how to utilize people to bring the best out of them and try to make them feel really good about their games. I think we have that with Travis in the Australian team and Travis in the Sunrisers team.\"\n\nIt is hard to find another franchise with the quality of overseas options to choose from that SRH possesses. However, the problem of plenty is still a problem which is what Aiden Markram and Brian Lara found out. The constant chopping and changing unsettled the side in 2023 and with inexperienced Indian players constantly shuffled to accommodate the overseas options. And that is where Cummins made sure there were limited moving parts in terms of players going out and coming. Dropping Marco Jansen after the first game against Kolkata Knight Riders and bringing in Travis Head is the only change Cummins made halfway through the season.\n\nNot only the overseas players but Cummins managed to liberate and give freedom to the young Indian players. Among them, Abhishek Sharma is a classic who has been a consistent performer for his state side Punjab in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy but could not bring in the same form to SRH. However, this year he along with Head at the top of the order is blasting oppositions out of the game in the Powerplay and laying the foundations for monstrous scores which SRH are now accustomed to making regularly.\n\nIt is a joy for the fans of Orange Army who have seen the franchise depend entirely on David Warner for years to put a par score on the board to keep breaking the existing T20 batting records. However, what came out of the syllabus was poor bowling performances.\n\nThe decline of Bhuvneswar Kumar in the last few years has hurt, however, Cummins has continued to show faith in him and would back his experience on the eve of the first game in Hyderabad against Mumbai Indians.\n\nBut the bowling seems like an Achilles heel for the Eagles which might cost them at some point in the season going forward. While they have been posting record totals with the bat they are also conceding big totals regularly.\n\nBut Vettori backed his bowlers: \"When you post as big scores you expect teams to come hard at us and that is what we have seen so far. And all the three 200-run scores that teams have prepared to come hard at us. There is an understanding that the wickets are good, we just have to navigate our way through that. I think the bowlers have done an amazing exceptional job that was highlighted by Natarajan in the last game, very happy with the way the bowlers are going.\n\n\"It is slightly a different world. We have to change our perspective of what is a good performance rather than looking at economies as 8,8.50 as long as your economy stays under the game economy you have done an exceptional job that is how we have viewed the bowling group.\" With Cummins leading the way, taking the onus of bowling the pressure match-turning overs on himself, SRH has continued to march on.", "source": {"uri":

Aaron Finch plays down prospect", "body": "Former Australian player, Aaron Finch played down the possibility of Pat Cummins leading Australia in the upcoming T20 World Cup. He rather picked Mitchell Marsh to captain the squad in the marquee tournament. Finch understood the fitness concerns regarding Marsh and reckoned that if he will be fully fit, he should lead the team.\n\nAustralia haven't announced their captain for the tournament so far, with the selectors having a meeting later this week. Marsh picked up an injury during the IPL and returned to his home. Meanwhile, Cummins continues to flourish as the captain for his national as well as franchise team, SRH. Looking at Cummins' captaincy record, especially in the marquee tournament, Australia might be tempted to pick him as the captain.\n\nWhile answering a question by India Today on the Star Sports Press Room Show, Finch pointed out the workload management regarding Cummins, who has been leading Australia in ODI, Test cricket and also SRH in IPL.\n\n\"Depends on Mitchel Marsh and his fitness. He is out at the moment. If he is fit, he will captain the Australian side, in my opinion. Australian cricket is really mindful of the load on Pat Cummins as a player and as a leader,\" Finch said.\n\nCummins became the 2nd most expensive player in the history of the IPL as he was roped in for Rs 20.50 crore by SRH in the auction. Cummins has proven his credentials as the captain of the Australian side, having won the World Test Championship, retaining the Ashes and winning the ODI World Cup all in the same year. Cummins has been living up to his price tag with captaincy as well as his bowling for SRH, who have been shattering one record after the other, every match. IPL 2024 Full Coverage | IPL 2024 Points Table and Standings | 2024 IPL Full Schedule\n\nFinch admitted that it could be \"time-consuming\" to be leading the charge of high-profile teams. Hence, he felt that Marsh could be picked to do the job for Australia.\n\n\"It's incredibly time-consuming to be a captain of an international team and a franchise team as a leader. The fact that he is captaining in Test cricket, ODI cricket, IPL, that is an incredible load, as well as playing all 3 formats and expecting to be at your absolute best, day in and day out, which he has been for the last couple of years.\"\n\n\"I think the recharge which he needs away from the game will come through Mitchell Marsh captaining and I don't know if he would be the right man for Australia at the moment.\"\n\nFinch was also impressed with Australia's new young sensation, Jake Fraser-McGurk, who has been a standout performer for Delhi this season. He scored a quickfire fifty in his maiden IPL match and followed it up with an 18-ball 65 during the match against DC.\n\nFinch wanted Fraser-McGurk to be picked for Australia's squad after he recently made his ODI debut for Australia during the series against West Indies.\n\n\"In terms of Jake Frazer Mc-Gurk, I think Australia have some seriously tough selection questions when they are picking their squad in the next week or so. I know they are meeting later in the week to have their initial meeting.

Having been named as Sunrisers Hyderabad's captain ahead of the 2024 IPL, Cummins has led the team admirably even if he has not been at his wicket-taking best.\n\nAfter finishing at the eighth spot in last two seasons, the SRH management trusted Cummins as their leader, removing Aiden Markram from the position despite his successive titles with Sunrisers' sister franchise Sunrisers Eastern Cape at the SA20. While the move was seen with shrunk eyes by many, Cummins, who has had a dream run with Australia with a WTC title and ODI World Cup, has repaid the faith shown in him by the thinktank, as the Hyderabad-based franchise has won five of their seven matches so far, dominating the opponents with consummate ease.\n\n\"We've already seen, so far, the freedom that SRH is playing with, and I think, whether it's a World Cup, whether it's the Big Bash, or any other T20 competition, you sit down and you map out how you think you're going to win it. And you have to be prepared because it's so volatile. From Australia's point of view and SRH's too, Pat has been a wonderful leader. I think the calmness that he brings to a group and also being a bowler, he can sympathize with a bowler when it's not going well. He knows what to say at the right time,\" Finch said on Star Sports Press Room.\n\n\"And I know in my experience as a batsman, when you speak to bowlers, sometimes you don't have the same understanding of why did you bowl that ball at that stage. And there's more to it than just a poorly executed delivery or maybe the plan was wrong. So, I think Pat's got that great understanding of what it takes to be a bowler in that situation. So, he gets through to them a lot easier,\" he added.\n\nFinch opened up on the possibility of Cummins leading the Australian T20 World Cup squad and Jake Fraser-McGurk's inclusion in the squad.\n\n\"Depending on Mitch Marsh and his fitness, he's obviously out at the moment because of his quad or his hamstring. I'm not 100% sure. But if he's fit, he will captain the side in my opinion. And Australian cricket is really mindful of the load on Pat Cummins as a player and as a leader. It's incredibly time-consuming to be a captain of an international team and a franchise for that matter. So, the fact that he's doing Test cricket, ODI cricket, IPL, that's an incredible load as well as playing three formats of the game and expecting to be at your absolute best day in, day out, which he has been for the last couple of years.\n\n\"So, I think the recharge that he needs away from the game will come through Mitch Marsh captaining, and I've got no doubt that Mitch Marsh is the right man for the job for Australia at the moment. In terms of Jake Fraser-McGurk, Australia has got some seriously tough selection questions when they're picking their squad in the next week or so.\n\n\"I know that they're meeting later in the week to have their initial meeting. They'll probably have two or three to go through the squad and dissect everything. But his name will be well and truly on the table, and there'll be some nervous guys around, I reckon, waiting for that squad to be announced because there's so many players, so much talent in Australian cricket at the moment,\" Finch said.\n\n\"I think that the spin could get them out of trouble. I think the form that Kuldeep is in, I expect that he'll be in that squad and in the starting 11. So I think that could cover up a few issues at times. Arshdeep, I feel, is still a very quality bowler. He can swing the new ball. He hasn't quite got it right. He's not in his best form at the moment, but I think he's got all the tools to have a big impact in a World Cup. But at the same time, understanding that it's still seven weeks away until they play, so there's enough time for guys to be playing another 10 games, potentially which is a lot when you're talking about T20 preparation.\"", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Finch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Finch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Eastern_Cape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Eastern Cape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA20_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SA20 (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Marsh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Marsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bash_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bash League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1712378291301_Pat-Cummins.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511732", "eventUri": "eng-9511732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 73, "relevance": 1}

Contributions from Cameron Green (37 runs off 20 balls) and Dinesh Karthik (11 runs off 6 balls) ensured a challenging total for SRH.\n\nIn response, Sunrisers Hyderabad fought valiantly but fell short of the target, managing 171/8 in their 20 overs. Abhishek Sharma's aggressive start (31 runs off 13 balls) set the tone for the chase, but despite notable contributions from Shahbaz Ahmed (40 runs off 37 balls) and Pat Cummins (31 runs off 15 balls), SRH couldn't sustain the momentum. RCB's bowling attack, led by Karn Sharma (2 wickets for 29 runs) and Swapnil Singh (2 wickets for 40 runs), kept the pressure on SRH throughout the innings.\n\nUltimately, RCB's all-round performance with both bat and ball secured their victory, maintaining their position in the league standings.

It can be similar to TikTok's carousel feature, which can allow users to add/post up to 35 photos in a single post.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time that Instagram has faced negative reviews from its users. A few days ago Instagram, the Meta-owned social media platform, was testing a new feature that could show 'unskippable' ads while you are scrolling your feeds. This proposed feature is known as 'Ad Breaks'. Reportedly, the experimental change was rolled out to a small group of users at present. In response to this, an X (previously Twitter) user @TheDanLevy posted \"Got the Instagram 'ad break' again and this time I clicked the info button to see their explanation.

That's effectively doubling the previous limit of 10, and while you might not use it daily, it's nice to be able to share more if you want to.\n\nNot only do these types of gallery posts have a fun effect, as you can quickly swipe through the photos using the dots below the photo, but they're also a great way to share more of the same type of content in one post. Monthly deposits - captioned \"July Recap\" or \"August So Far\" - have become quite popular on the platform, and it's likely that those posting monthly dumps will benefit more from them.\n\nIt's worth noting that this isn't a count you have to hit; you can create and publish a carousel post with anywhere from 1 to 20 photos, videos, or both media types. The new limit is closer to TikTok's limit of 35, which could be seen as Instagram trying to increase engagement compared to the app primarily known for vertical video.\n\nThis latest change is now rolling out globally to all Instagram users, and may already be an option for you if you're trying to post.

From an option to upload music in the background of the photos/videos to let users collaborate with other users on their content - the carousel Instagram posts have come a long way. Now, the option to add up to 20 images within a post will open opportunities for creators as well as users who love to share every moment in detail.\n\nHowever, it could be overwhelming for many. With the option to upload as many as pictures and videos as you want, some followers may feel dumped with a lot of content. Plus, will they scroll till the end? It will always be a matter of debate, however, more is always better. The new update to let users upload will open new channels of creativity.\n\nOn the other hand, TikTok (banned in India) allows users to post up to 35 photos, which is still almost double Instagram's ability to post posts.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Instagram-Image-upload.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802696", "eventUri": "eng-9802696", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

This change doubles the previous limit of 10, offering more flexibility and creativity for those who love to share multiple moments in one post.\n\nInstagram's latest update is all about giving users more space to showcase their content. Whether you're a social media influencer, a business, or just someone who enjoys documenting your life, this new feature will make it easier to share more photos and videos in one post. This update means you can now combine up to 20 visuals into a single post, giving you a richer way to tell your story.\n\nThe feature has started rolling out globally, though it's a gradual process. This means it might take some time before all users have access to the new limit. Instagram has not yet provided a specific timeline for when the update will be available to everyone, but it's expected to be fully rolled out in the coming weeks.\n\nTo take advantage of this new feature, follow these simple steps:\n\nInstagram first introduced the carousel feature in 2017, allowing users to share multiple photos or videos in a single post. Over the years, this feature has seen various enhancements aimed at improving user experience. For instance, recent updates included the ability to add songs to grid posts and enable collaboration, allowing multiple users to contribute to a single post.\n\nThis latest update is part of Instagram's ongoing effort to enhance its platform and provide more options for content creators. By expanding the carousel limit, Instagram is catering to the growing demand for richer, more detailed posts that can showcase a variety of moments and experiences.\n\nThis expansion is significant for several reasons:\n\nAs Instagram continues to evolve, this update is a clear indication of the platform's commitment to enhancing user experience. While the expanded carousel feature is a significant improvement, it's likely not the last innovation we'll see from Instagram. The company has a history of rolling out new features and updates to keep users engaged and provide new ways to share content.\n\nStay tuned for further developments and updates, as Instagram often introduces new tools and features that enhance the way users interact with the platform.

Now, you can post double the amount of content.\n\nWhen Instagram gained popularity, the app was all about getting that single, perfect photo to share with your followers. As the years passed, the idea of \"photo dumps\" gained popularity as users started posting a slew of photos and videos in a carousel format instead of stressing over selecting a singular image.\n\nBy doubling the number of photos and videos that users can share in a carousel, Instagram is embracing photo dumps in time for the end of summer. The update is reminiscent of when they would upload a whole photo album of images from summer vacation on Facebook during the height of the platform's popularity.\n\nThe change brings Instagram closer to TikTok's carousel feature, which allows users to include up to 35 photos in a single post.\n\nWhile some users may be excited about the update, others may see it as overkill as Instagram continues to move further away from the simple photo-sharing app it was a decade ago. Not everyone will be interested in swiping through more than 10 slides of a user's post, especially when the app is already stuffed with so many other content formats, such as reels, stories, and notes.\n\nThe launch of the expanded limit doesn't come as a surprise, as the platform was spotted testing it back in March.\n\nThursday's announcement comes a day after Instagram revealed that it's making \"Views\" the primary metric across all of its formats, including reels, live, photos, carousels, and stories.\n\nThe change means that creators will be able to track the same metric across all of their content.", "source": {"uri": "see.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "see.news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2.wp.com/see.news/images/2024/08/instagram-1723195837-0.jpg?resize=920%2C550&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802696", "eventUri": "eng-9802696", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Monthly dumps - captioned \"July recap\" or \"August so far\" - have become pretty popular on the platform, and it's likely that those who post monthly dumps will get some more mileage out of this.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not a count you need to hit; you can create and publish a carousel post with anywhere between 1 and 20 photos, videos, or both media types. The new limit gets closer to matching TikTok's limit of 35, which could be seen as Instagram trying to increase engagement compared to the app that is first and foremost known for vertical video.\n\nThis latest change is now rolling out globally to all Instagram users and may already be an option for you if you try posting.

The social media giant has just rolled out an update that doubles the number of photos and videos you can include in a single carousel post, allowing up to 20 pieces of media. This exciting change, reported by Engadget, is now available globally, offering users more space to showcase their creativity, memories, or daily moments.\n\nFor those who love to document every detail of their lives, this update is a game-changer. Instagram's previous limit of 10 images or videos per post often left users wanting more, especially when trying to tell a comprehensive story or share a full experience. This new 20-piece limit is reminiscent of the early days of social media when users would upload entire photo albums to platforms like Facebook. Now, Instagram is bringing a bit of that nostalgia back, encouraging users to share more of their lives with their followers.\n\nThe carousel post feature, which Instagram introduced in 2017, quickly became a favourite for storytelling. Whether you're showcasing a detailed outfit of the day, a travel adventure, or a collection of memes, the ability to string together multiple images or videos has been a hit among users. With this new update, content creators, influencers, and businesses are likely to be the most thrilled. The expanded media limit provides even more opportunities to engage audiences, tell richer stories, and showcase products in a more detailed way.\n\nHowever, this update might spark mixed reactions among everyday users and their followers. Not everyone is keen on scrolling through 20 photos of someone's brunch or multiple angles of the same sunset. While some may appreciate the additional context and detail, others might find it overwhelming. This raises a key question: Will this new feature enhance the Instagram experience, or could it lead to an overload of content?\n\nFor businesses and influencers, the update is undoubtedly a win. It allows them to be more creative, offering richer and more engaging content that can hold a follower's attention for longer. But for casual users, there's a risk of crossing the fine line between sharing and oversharing. As Instagram becomes a place where more is more, followers might start to feel inundated, leading to an increase in the use of the \"mute\" button.\n\nUltimately, how this update impacts Instagram will depend on how users choose to embrace it. If used thoughtfully, the expanded carousel feature can elevate storytelling on the platform. However, if it leads to an overwhelming flood of content, it may leave some followers yearning for the simplicity of fewer, more impactful posts. Either way, Instagram is set to see a lot more sharing in the days ahead.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side-scrolling video game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/08/09/1469533-insta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802696", "eventUri": "eng-9802696", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Notably, it builds upon the AI avatar creation platform dubbed Meta AI Studio which was rolled out for users in the US last month.\n\nAccording to a press release by Instagram, users can now add up to 20 photos or videos in a single carousel. The expansion of this feature brings convenience to users who share many pieces of content by eliminating the need to split media collections into multiple posts. Carousels can be browsed by swiping right on Instagram.\n\nThe Carousels feature on Instagram was first announced in 2015, with the ability to include up to 5 images. It was expanded in 2017 with the inclusion of videos and the ceiling was raised to 10. In March, the social media platform was reported to be testing the expansion of this feature by allowing a limited pool of users to include up to 15 frames in a single carousel. It was expected to be expanded to more users over time.\n\nWhile Instagram claims that the feature is being rolled out starting today, Gadgets 360 staff members were unable to verify its arrival on multiple smartphones.\n\nIn recent months, Instagram has been rolling out new features and enhancements to existing ones in a bid to improve the experience, especially for content creators. Last month, an update introduced multi-track support for Instagram Reels, allowing users to add up to 20 tracks in a single reel.\n\nThe introduction of Meta AI Studio also brought AI characters. As the name suggests, users can create an AI-powered character with a name, tagline, and description - information that will be used as a base for the creation of a mini chatbot. Furthermore, content creators on Instagram can also generate AI avatars of themselves which can respond to direct messages (DMs) and story replies.", "source": {"uri": "gadgets360.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV Gadgets 360"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_reel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing reel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/instagram_carousels_1723192673856.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802696", "eventUri": "eng-9802696", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The popular social media platform has doubled the number of photos and videos you can include in a carousel post, according to a report by Endgadget. That's right -- now you can share up to 20 pieces of media in a single post, instead of the previous limit of 10. This update is rolling out globally, allowing users everywhere to showcase even more of their memories, creativity, or daily lives.\n\nFor those who love to share every moment, this change is a dream come true. Remember the days when Facebook was the place to post endless streams of vacation photos? Before smartphones were everywhere, people would upload whole albums from their digital cameras. Instagram's new limit brings a bit of that vibe back, letting you flood your followers with more of your best -- or perhaps most mundane -- moments.\n\nThe carousel feature, which Instagram introduced back in 2017, has always been a favorite for storytelling. Whether it's a detailed outfit post, a travel diary, or just a collection of memes, the ability to string multiple images or videos together has been a hit. But with more freedom comes a question: will people enjoy sharing more, or could it become too much for their followers?\n\nOn one hand, content creators, influencers, and businesses are likely to love this update. More media means more ways to engage audiences, tell stories, and showcase products. For them, this change is an opportunity to be more creative and share richer content.\n\nBut for the average user -- or their followers -- it could be a different story. Not everyone is eager to scroll through 20 photos of someone's brunch or every angle of a sunset. While some people might appreciate the added detail, others might find it overwhelming. There's a fine line between sharing and oversharing, and this update might push some users to cross it.\n\nIn the end, it will come down to how people choose to use this new feature. If used thoughtfully, it could enhance the way stories are told on Instagram. But if it leads to an overload of content, followers might find themselves hitting the \"mute\" button more often.\n\nSo, whether you're someone who loves to document every moment or a follower who prefers quality over quantity, this update is sure to shake up your Instagram experience. Get ready to see -- and share -- a whole lot more.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/instagram-08362057-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ytLCErvqH1XWX0.YP0Poc6L.N__7Jzfv", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802696", "eventUri": "eng-9802696", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Instagram is no longer restricting carousels to 10 photos or videos. Now, you can post up to 20.\n\nThe art of an Instagram post has gone through many phases. What began as heavily filtered low-stakes shots morphed into pristine \"aesthetic\" photos and finally into the highly curated photo dump that started out fun and turned into a series of seemingly mandatory life updates -- Mashable's Christianna Silva even called them cringe back in March. Now, with 20-slide posts, photo dumps might go the way of the Facebook album, which is extinct. Social media is nothing if not cyclical.\n\nInstagram feeds are overwhelmed with sponsored posts and creators, making them practically un-scrollable. Instead of fixing the fact that you don't see the people you know's posts anymore and making the platform more usable, it's still chasing after TikTok's success.\n\nThe update makes carousel posts on Instagram even more closely resemble TikTok's photo mode, which allows users to post up to 35 photos in a slideshow set to music. Last year, Instagram added the option for users to soundtrack their dumps, and now the length of dumps is more in line with photo mode.\n\nWhat will Instagram's next nail in the coffin be?", "source": {"uri": "me.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable ME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elena_cavender@me.mashable.com", "name": "Elena Cavender", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mashable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsored_post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sponsored post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slide show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Services", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_me/article/y/you-can-no/you-can-now-share-up-to-20-photos-in-one-instagram-post_ptur.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802696", "eventUri": "eng-9802696", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Well, for the average users it was, as advertisers on Instagram had the ability to do so two years before even then.

Sister social media site Facebook has had the ability to let users dump as many images as they want in a post, limited only by the uploader's obnoxiousness. But perhaps that's the reason that this limit is present elsewhere.\n\nOn that note, The Verge mentions that the ability to have 20 images or videos in a single Instagram post makes it more in line with TikTok, which can take 35 per post. Though as the latter is primarily a short video platform, it's odd that it has that sort of demand for uploading images to begin with.

While Facebook has legacy on its side, and TikTok is the young pup on the scene, Instagram probably has the broadest mix of appeal and longevity.\n\nOne of the biggest gripes most have about the platform is the posting limit. A carousel of images and videos can only include ten items.\n\nThat's often not quite enough for the snap happy among us, who will still spend a painstaking amount of time culling images down to a perfect ten-shot reel. Well, that's a thing of the past, now, as the brand is upping that limit.\n\nUsers will now be able to share up to 20 items per carousel, doubling the previous capacity. That's going to be great news for many users, who will now be able to share more of their favourite images without fear of hitting the limit.\n\nIt could also put an end to the trend of posting two or three different round-ups of the same trip or event. Where that had been a necessity for many thanks to the previously imposed limit, it may now be a thing of the past.\n\nSo, is it worthwhile? Well, that remains to be seen. Personally, I'm quite reserved on the platform, rarely posting anything even close to the current limit. With that being said, I can certainly see the appeal - users with a lot to share will love this.\n\nWhile I'll likely never need to share 20 images in one go, having that option is a great backup for getting all of the good stuff out in a single post. If I only need to use it once, it will still be a handy thing to have - and there's not really any downside.\n\nThe update is already showing live for some users right now. The feature will roll out to every user, though some will have to wait a little longer as part of a phased rollout. At the time of writing, the update has reached my personal phone.

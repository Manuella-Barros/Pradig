Mr Sharif stressed that those spreading fake news should be identified and checked.\n\nEarlier in the day, it was reported in the media that the speaker had prepared a reference against Justice Khosa under Article 209 of the Constitution, levelling allegations of misconduct, to be filed in the Supreme Judicial Council. The alleged complaint purportedly mentioned the judge's remarks labelling the speaker as Mr Sharif's loyalist.\n\nSince PM Abbasi had arrived in Lahore following his meeting with Balochistan Chief Minister Sanaullah Zehri and Governor Muhammad Khan Achakzai in Quetta, he also apprised Mr Sharif of the law and order situation and pace of development projects in the province.\n\nThe prime minister said he had reviewed the security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a terrorist attack on an army truck at Pishin bus stop in Quetta, in which at least 15 people, including army personnel, died and over 40 others were injured.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373593", "time": "04:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373593", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "48315", "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "48501", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303057", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "score": 1}, {"id": "304334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "score": 4}, {"id": "307776", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "score": 5}, {"id": "309394", "label": {"eng": "Balochistan, Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "357423", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khaqan Abbasi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi", "score": 4}, {"id": "398473", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Abbasid Caliphate"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate", "score": 4}, {"id": "415521", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Operation Lyari"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Lyari", "score": 2}, {"id": "532047", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Khan Achakzai"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Khan_Achakzai", "score": 2}, {"id": "720396", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jati Umra (Lahore)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jati_Umra_(Lahore)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1317796", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sanaullah Zehri"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaullah_Zehri", "score": 2}], "image": "http://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/59990441d4807.jpg", "timeCrawl": "04:04:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "PM rushes to Sharif over SJC reference media reports", "originalArticle": null}

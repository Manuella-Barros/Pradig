{"id": 231975104, "title": "I accidentally named my son after my mum and only realised after six months", "text": "A mum has hilariously realised she accidentally named her six-month-old son after her own mother. Sharing her story on Reddit's r/namenerds forum, user groovysuzie described the \"ridiculous\" moment she noticed that her son's first and middle names combined to make her mum's name. She posted: \"6 months later, I realized I accidentally named my son after my mom. I just had a funny/ ridiculous realization that my son's middle and first name said together is my mom's name.\" To help explain without giving away their real names, she used an example: \"Mom's name: Marilyn. Son's name: Lin Mara.\" She added: \"It's so ridiculous I can't believe nobody else has noticed. The example given makes it a little more obvious than their actual names but not by much. My son's first name is meaningful in his dad's language and his middle name has a meaning in the languages of both our cultures.\" She also mentioned that her son's first name holds significance in his dad's language, while his middle name is meaningful in both parents' cultures. Despite the mix-up, some Reddit users thought the naming was quite clever. One commented, \"I knew a woman whose maiden name was Margolin. She named her daughter Margo Lin (first and middle - maybe spelled Lynn, idr), along with her married last name. I thought it clever, but not a gimmick.\" Another pointed out that it resembled a tradition where children are given names related to the mother's maiden name, suggesting that what happened might be seen as a smart, albeit accidental, choice. They penned: \"In the South there is a tradition of either moving the maiden name to the middle for the wife, or naming the first child if it's a boy the mother's maiden name as a middle name, and if it's a girl the mothers maiden name as a first name.\" Another Reddit user disclosed how they named their child in a similar manner, although they took a bit longer to make the connection. They said: \"When we told my daughter she was named after my grandmother, Florence, she asked my mom if I was named after my grandmother (mom's mom), too, because my name was in the middle of her name. At first we were puzzled and then just like that it hit us. My name is Lauren.\"", "summary": "A woman has taken to social media to share the realisation she had about her six-month-old son's name - it took her six months to realise she had named the boy after her own mother", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/i-accidentally-named-son-after-32992298", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32992362.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Family-and-pet.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:31:36", "author": "Ewan Gleadow,Ewan-Gleadow", "authors": ["Ewan Gleadow", "Ewan-Gleadow"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.05}

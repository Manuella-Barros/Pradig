The France striker, a winner in 2018 of course, was denied a second successive world crown by Romero\u2019s Argentina in a pulsating final at the 2022 edition in Qatar. Goals from Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria put La Albiceleste into a commanding lead before a stunning brace from Mbappe sent the game to extra-time. Messi would score again before Mbappe\u2019s penalty made him the first man to score a hat-trick in the biggest game the sport has to offer since Geoff Hurst did so for England in 1966. Such a dramatic affair was always likely to cause tempers to flare. Mbappe was not only mocked by Argentina goalkeeper Emi Martinez in wild dressing room celebrations after the game but also had a run-in with Romero on the pitch. International teammate and Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez revealed back in March: \u201cWe argued a bit on the field. I don\u2019t really like to tell what happens. I had said some things, but that remains on the field. \u201cCuti is crazy, he yelled the goal in his face!\u201d Mbappe, who will lead Les Bleus into Euro 2024 as captain for the first time, recently suggested the European Championship was in fact harder to win than the World Cup. \u201cThe Euros are complicated. For me, more complicated than a World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if there is more pressure at the World Cup. All the teams know each other, we play against each other all the time. Tactically, it is a very similar soccer.\u201d Pressed on Mbappe\u2019s assertion by Argentine outlet MDZ, Romero replied: \"They are each person's opinions, they are respected. \u201cThe World Cup is the most difficult competition that I have had to play in. I have had the possibility of winning all the competitions that I have played with the national team. \u201cI cannot explain what that happens inside you when you win a World Cup. \"I think it is the most difficult, but each person can give their opinion what they want. Opinion is free and if for them other things are more complicated that is fine. \u201cFor me the World Cup is the most complicated competition that I have had to play in.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Pair clashed during 2022 World Cup final</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenhams-cristian-romero-responds-to-kylian-mbappes-world-cup-claim-b1163089.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/16/45/ipiccy_image__35_.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/RrOacXsm-BqwSYW3q.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:02:25", "author": "Jonathan Gorrie", "authors": ["Jonathan Gorrie"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.258}

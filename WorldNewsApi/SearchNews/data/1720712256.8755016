The plans include investment in mental health treatment, a targeted disability benefit system, and a clampdown on welfare fraud. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Labour \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the courage to tackle this issue and will let the welfare bill spiral,\u201d while Labour said the Tories\u2019 \u00a312 billion savings target was plucked \u201cout of thin air.\u201d The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said it \u201clooks difficult in the extreme\u201d that the measures would enable further savings of \u00a312 billion compared to the forecast based on the Spring Budget. The number of working-age people who are out of work has risen sharply since the COVID-19 pandemic and is thought to be driven in part by those who have taken early retirement and those with long-term health conditions waiting for treatment on the NHS. But the Conservative Party said the 40 percent increase in economically inactive people from 2 million to 2.8 million overall since the pandemic is unsustainable. They have promised to bring this total down, claiming the cost of providing benefits for working-age people with health conditions could rise as high as \u00a390 billion by the end of the next Parliament. Among the steps the party would take to do this are several where the early stages have been floated by the Tories in government. This includes a \u00a3700 million investment in NHS mental health treatment, to ensure 500,000 more people can access talking therapies to help with poor mental health. A pledge to reform the disability benefits system and target it at those most in need is also part of the offer, as is a tightening of the criteria for work capability assessments. Previously announced plans to pass on the responsibility for issuing sick notes from GPs to specialist work and health professionals are within the Tories\u2019 plans. The Conservatives also promise to toughen benefit sanction rules, speed up the rollout of universal credit, and clamp down on benefit fraudsters. The prime minister said it\u2019s not right or fair that young people are \u201cbeing parked on benefits,\u201d adding, \u201cA job gives you not just the chance to earn but a sense of purpose.\u201d He also said that he wants to reduce immigration, but it means \u201cwe must get our own people back to work.\u201d Pitching the plan to voters, Mr. Sunak said the July 4 general election is a choice between \u201ca Tory Party that will get people back into work or a Labour Party that doesn\u2019t have the courage to tackle this issue and will let the welfare bill spiral, leading to a huge waste of human potential and higher taxes for you.\u201d Labour accused the prime minister of causing a spiralling benefits bill in the first place. \u201cThis is the latest desperate announcement from Rishi Sunak, who has once again plucked numbers out of thin air in an attempt to disguise the fact that he has caused a spiralling benefits bill,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThese reheated pledges, old policies, and vague promises will not get Britain healthy or benefits under control, and do nothing to solve the fact that \u00a310 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money was lost to benefit fraud just last year.\u201d The spokesperson said Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party \u201chas a plan to cut NHS waiting lists, get Britain back to work, make work pay, and get the benefits bill down.\u201d The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said while cuts are possible, the pledge won\u2019t change the latest spending forecast because most of the plans have already been accounted for. \u201cThe most substantial proposal that is not already baked into the forecast is one intended to reduce the numbers who are able to receive disability benefits on the basis of a mental health condition. Cuts are certainly possible. But history suggests that reductions in spending are often much harder to realise than is claimed,\u201d he said. \u201cDelivering an additional \u00a312 billion saving from this set of measures relative to what was forecast in the March Budget looks difficult in the extreme. That said, even if it was achieved, it would still only leave spending around its current level.\u201d According to the IFS, \u00a312 billion of savings by the end of the next Parliament would only \u201coffset the forecast growth in spending.\u201d", "summary": "The IFS think tank said the announcement is unlikely to change the latest spending forecast as most of the plans have been floated before.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/tories-pledge-welfare-reforms-to-save-12-billion-a-year-5665382", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/09/id5665386-Rishi-Sunak-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:16:43", "author": "Lily Zhou", "authors": ["Lily Zhou"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.474}

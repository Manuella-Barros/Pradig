Kelly is well placed above the quota and is in line to be first elected this afternoon. Also safe is his party colleague, Ciaran Brogan (FF), who has been in politics for 25 years and counting. Newcomer Tom\u00e1s Se\u00e1n Devine from the 100% Redress Party took the third highest preference tally votes and 9.8% of the overall.

With the tally quota at 1,603, this leaves Gerry McMonagle (SF) and Donal Coyle (FF) as the outgoing councillors expected to retain their seats. Kevin Bradley (IND) is in a risky position and Coyle is under some pressure, while Aont\u00fa\u2019s Mary T Sweeney, Declan Jordan (IND) and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Sandra Haughey\u2019s transfers are important. Gerry McMonagle is due to benefit from transfers from his fellow party members Haughey and Hughes. First count is expected this afternoon.

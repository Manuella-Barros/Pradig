Dr. John Kome, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, is the party\u2019s 2023 candidate for Ikeja Constituency 1 seat in the Lagos House of Assembly. He spoke to EJIKEME OMENAZU on the first one year of President Bola Tinubu administration, among other crucial issues. Excerpt. As preparations are on for the first anniversary of the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019s government on May 29, how would you assess the administration so far? Tinubu at 365 days? To me, the state of the nation is indescribable. It is gloomy. Although he is promising Nigerians that this storm will turn to boom in the nearest future, we are waiting in anticipation for that. None-theless, it is my prayer that Nigerians will not all die before the boom. Peo-ple are already dying. Not many can afford healthcare and they are dying in droves. I understand that before he took over power, the previous admin-istration had brought Nigeria down to its knees. President Tinubu has to make critical decisive decisions, al-though with the intention of revival of the downcast economy, those de-cisions brought the country down instead of bringing out the country out of the quagmire it found itself. So far, would you say President Tinubu\u2019s Renewed Hope Agenda raises hope for Nigerians? I can say that it is more of rhet-oric than reality judging by events of the past one year. Some people say the Renewed Hope Agenda is all propaganda. The fluctuation of the Nigerian currency and instability of the economy, insecurity, infrastruc-ture decay, hike in electricity tariff, all do not give promise as far as the Renewed Hope Agenda is concerned. For example, the Naira keeps crash-ing against foreign currencies. At a time, it started recovering. Nigerians had said then that the recovery would not be sustained because it was not backed up with any fiscal policy. True to prediction, the currency has start-ed going worse. The costs of fuel \u2013 pet-rol, diesel, gas \u2013 do not give hope to the renewal we have been promised. Inflationary trend in every sector of the economy is destroying our hope in that agenda. What would you say are some of the challenges of the current federal admin-istration? First, the major challenge the ad-ministration is dealing with is the is-sue of having the right people in the helm of affairs. For example, a Min-ister of power was moved out of that ministry. It means that from the onset, he was not a square peg in a square hole. It means that right people are not heading the structure of the Re-newed Hope Agenda. However, no matter the challenge a government may have, when the president has the right people, he can fight such chal-lenges. Be it corruption, infrastruc-ture, etc. This administration has not put in place people who know how to fight such challenges, except few like the Minister of Works, David Umahi. He seems to know what the Renewed Hope Agenda is about and by the way he is going about it, we can see hope. The insecurity that has bedeviled our country seems to be unabated. Those in charge of that section of Nigerian life should do more to curb insecurity without which foreign investors can-not come in. Whatever the Ministry of Investment puts on the table in the Renewed Hope Agenda cannot work unless insecurity is nipped in the bud. Nobody wants to invest where there is insecurity. Local investors do not even have trust the environment to invest in Nigeria. They are taking their investments outside Nigeria. How can foreign investors come in when local investors are moving out of Nigeria? The investment climate in Nigeria is discouraging and not ap-pealing. Beyond investing in business infrastructure, our brains and profes-sionals are moving away from Nige-ria. They want to invest their brain elsewhere. My friends who have run out of Nigeria are in hundreds. Bank-ers, engineers, health professionals, etc, are leaving. Those who have dol-lars are taking their dollars out. Tal-ents and skills are leaving. How can foreigners bring in their resources? Who will they use if I am a foreigner, coming to invest; I will need the local professionals. When they are leaving, who will I use to power my interests? Do you think the president\u2019s Economic Team are living up to expectation? My view is as good as what we are seeing in the economy. What do we see on ground? The fluctuation of the Naira, the Naira instability, the cost of living in the country the president should look into his Eco-nomic Team. Let them reappraise the policy direction. The Economic Team should also open their arms to more people to proffer solutions and suggestions for private sector contributions. Nobody is an Island of knowledge. How do you think the current impasse of the Labour Movement and the Federal Government over the national minimum wage could be resolved? I think both sides must be consid-erate. The N54,000, how far can it go? To put food on the table of an aver-age Nigerian, a bag of rice is between N70,000 and N80,000. The minimum wage cannot afford a bag of rice not to talk of ingredients. Will the work-er be sleeping under the bridge? The electricity tariff is hiked. A tenant pays up to N40,000 on electricity. What of school fees? What of school fees? What of housing? What of transpor-tation, etc? The government should put the citizens in their own position. The workers should also realise that even if the government pays N250,000 to N500,000. What of the budget of the Federal Government? Should the government use the whole budget to pay salaries? What of infrastruc-ture? What of the dangers of infla-tion? Won\u2019t that turn our currency to that of Zimbabwe where people can hold one million that cannot afford anything tangible? The politicians are the cause of the problems. They spent billions of dollars to buy Jeeps while the workers are watching. The National Assembly members drive those vehicles, earning huge sala-ries while the Nigerian workers are watching. They are the cause of the workers\u2019 demand. If the National Assembly members are earning N800,000, the workers should not have been demanding N600,000. They earn so much and expect the workers to go home with peanuts. Is there any sense in that? Would you say the questionable and controversial manner Asiwaju Bola Tinubu became the president is affecting the administration in any way? I don\u2019t think so. Even if there seem to be a claim that Tinubu did not win the election that does not affect the way to run the process. They are dif-ferent things entirely. Those who are in the school of thought that Presi-dent Bola Ahmed Tinubu did not win, evened he had won free and square, will it change anything? It will not. He would still have his Renewed How Agenda structure. Will you say that the good hands refused to accept his appointments because he did not win the election? I don\u2019t think the process is affecting his performance. If he brings the country out of the woods, what will Nigerians say again? I have heard people say that because he has no certificate. But I have seen several governors without credible certificates doing well. People like the late Murtala Mohammed who had no degrees the little he did was okay. He rich people in the world are not greatly certificated individuals. People like the Bill Gates, Ali Baba of China, the Facebook giant, are not great certificate holders. What chang-es the individuals are what you are. If you go to Akwa Ibom, successive governments have been doing well. It depends on if the person has pas-sion for the country, has dreams, inspiration. Nigeria is looking for a president, governors, lawmakers who have passion for Nigeria, dedicated to the cause of Nigeria, not those who want to achieve selfish ends. Where are the Azikiwes of the South East, Awolowos of the South West, Balewas of the North, Enahoros of the Mid West? They exist. But they will not be allowed to get there. Majority of the leaders are not committed to the Nigerian cause. A lot of Nigerians are crititising Tinubu because of his Emi lo Kan philosophy. But it is not about Tinubu, but the mindset of Nigeri-ans. It is us, us, us. It is the wish of ev-ery section of Nigeria for their son to go there and get for them. Emi lo Kan did not start with Tinubu. Urhobo, Yoruba, Fulani, etc, if you put them in power, their people will believe that it is their turn to get what belongs to them. I am not a spokesperson of Tinubu. People should stop criticis-ing him because of Emi lo kan. It is a Nigerian thing. Do you see the realignment of opposition forces for the 2027 elections will work? It will work 100 percent. It is the realignment of political forces that removed the Peoples Democratic Par-ty (PDP). Why won\u2019t it happen again? If the realignment is genuine, why can\u2019t it work? If the All Progressives Congress (APC) fails to improve the nation, the realignment can remove it. Religion and ethnicity are no lon-ger in vogue. The hunger in the land does not know religion and ethnicity. Would you say the alliance of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Labour Party (LP) will be victorious if former Vice Pres-ident Abubakar Atiku of PDP steps down for Peter Obi of Labour Party? Why won\u2019t it work? Atiku has said it himself. Atiku is experienced. He headed the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) before becoming Vice President under Obasanjo. He headed the Economic Team under Obasanjo. He understands Nigeria very well. For him to say that if Peter Obi will come out, he will support him, he understands the implication of what he said. It means he has realisd that Obi presidential candidacy is pow-erful enough to remove the current administration. With his support and that of of others, 2027 will be for Nigerians. I met Obi earlier in the week where he was invited to speak. African countries have seen Obi as a solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems. I know what Nigerians in Diaspora are saying about him. It took a lot of efforts to ensure that they did not mob him at that forum. Obi is a man of the people. With Atiku\u2019s support and the strong realignment of forces, 2027 will be a very good political test game for Nigerians. Do you believe that the PDP and Labour Party alliance can succeed? PDP and Labour Party have al-ready come together. It is a matter of time for it manifest.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"547\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Kome-4.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Kome-4.jpg 547w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Kome-4-300x204.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" /></div>\u00a0Hon.

At the same time, Boeing is reinspecting all 787 airplanes still within the production system and must also create a plan to address the in-service fleet,\" the FAA's statement added. \"As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action -- as always -- to ensure the safety of the flying public.\"\n\nAs the WSJ exclusive reminded, the FAA has been keeping a close eye on Boeing following the January 5 incident aboard an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX aircraft that saw a door plug blow out of the aircraft after taking off. The outlet also quoted from an internal memo from Scott Stocker, the head of the 787 program at Boeing, in the wake of the revelation that required inspections had not been completed but checked off by employees as if they had been.\n\nThe memo was sent to \"celebrate\" the employee who spoke up about the failure to perform inspections:\n\nThe teammate saw what appeared to be an irregularity in a required conformance test in wing body join. He raised it with his manager, who brought it to the attention of executive leadership. I wanted to personally thank and commend that teammate for doing the right thing. It's critical that every one of us speak up when we see something that may not look right, or that needs attention.\n\nAfter receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed. As you all know, we have zero tolerance for not following processes designed to ensure quality and safety. We promptly informed our regulator about what we learned and are taking swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates.\n\nFortunately, our engineering team has assessed that this misconduct did not create an immediate safety of flight issue. But it will impact our customers and factory teammates, because the test now needs to be conducted out of sequence on airplanes in the build process...\n\nBoeing, already under stricter-than-usual oversight from the FAA, clearly has some more issues to work through when it comes to quality assurance and employee adherence to company policies on the assembly line.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_brown@townhall.com", "name": "Spencer Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/124/fad6903a-45be-485d-bc1e-d7fcb18ab06d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543987", "eventUri": "eng-9543987", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 1306, "textEnd": 1315}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Boeing provided an internal April 29 email to NPR written by Scott Stocker who heads the 787 program. It was sent to Boeing's South Carolina employees where the 787 is manufactured.\n\nStocker wrote that an employee \"saw something in our factory that he believed was not being done right, and spoke up about it.\" The issue was raised to the executive team who notified the FAA. \"After receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed.\"\n\nBoeing says it's taking \"swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates.\"\n\nIn March a former Boeing quality control manager who became a whistleblower about safety issues with the 787 Dreamliner was found dead in a vehicle after an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. John Barnett had testified the day before in a deposition related to a string of problems he says he identified at Boeing's North Charleston, S.C. plant.\n\nBoeing has been under renewed scrutiny for production and quality control lapses after a door plug blew off a 737 Max 9 in-flight in January.

Get ahead with us - it's free.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has opened a new investigation into possible safety lapses at Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner campus in North Charleston.\n\nThe probe announced May 6 is related to potential falsified inspection records that the planemaker reported to safety regulators in April. An employee at the assembly campus off International Boulevard \"saw something in our factory that he believed was not being done right, and spoke up about it,\" according to an April 29 message Scott Stocker, Boeing's vice president for manufacturing and safety, sent to employees.\n\nThe Post and Courier obtained a copy of the message on Monday.\n\nThe FAA is investigating whether Boeing employees completed required inspections related to the electrical safeguards of bonding and grounding where wings join the fuselage on Dreamliner jets, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report on the issue. The regulator is also looking into whether workers might have falsified records related to the inspections.\n\nBusiness Lawsuit accuses former manager at SC Porsche dealership of taking bribes for cars By David Wren dwren@postandcourier.com\n\nStocker, in his message to employees, said Boeing reviewed the matter \"and learned that several people had been violating company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed.\" He said the planemaker \"promptly informed our regulator about what we learned and (is) taking swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates.\"\n\nBoeing has determined the issue is not an immediate flight risk, according to Stocker's message.\n\nNo Dreamliners have been taken out of service and production is continuing as normal at the North Charleston plant. The FAA said Boeing will be reinspecting all 787s that are currently in production and must come up with a plan on how to address testing on planes that are already in service.\n\nBusiness Boeing is running out of parts for its SC-built Dreamliners. Find out why. By David Wren dwren@postandcourier.com\n\n\"As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action -- as always -- to ensure the safety of the flying public,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nStocker said in his message that the issue will impact customers \"because the test now needs to be conducted out of sequence on airplanes in the build process.\"\n\n\"I know this frustrates all of you as much as it frustrates me, and it's a reminder of why it's so critical that each of us does our part, every day, to ensure full compliance with our policies and procedures,\" Stocker said. \"And to speak up if you see something that doesn't seem right.\"\n\nBusiness SC ports agency seeks buyer for equipment at center of Chinese tariff fight By David Wren dwren@postandcourier.com\n\nThe latest issue is not related to paper-thin gaps that were discovered on the fuselage of Dreamliner jets in 2021 and led Boeing to halt deliveries of the widebody jet for 15 months. More recently, Boeing temporarily paused Dreamliner deliveries in 2023 because of a documentation issue by supplier Spirit Aerosystems.\n\nThe latest problem comes just weeks after whistleblower Sam Salehpour told Congress that Boeing took safety shortcuts to speed up production of its 787 and 777 models. Salehpour worked at Boeing's 787 plant in Everett, Wash. All Dreamliner production was consolidated to South Carolina in 2021.\n\nAnother whistleblower, John Barnett, took his life in March while in Charleston to give testimony in a case alleging safety problems at the Lowcountry plant.\n\nThis is another in a line of problems that have plagued Boeing this year, starting on Jan. 5 when a door plug blew out the side of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max while in flight. It was later determined that bolts that were supposed to hold the door plug in place were missing when the single-aisle plane was delivered to the carrier.\n\nSign up for our business newsletter.

The company publicly disclosed this after news broke of yet another federal investigation into the company.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration revealed on Monday that it was conducting a new probe into the embattled airplane manufacturer -- this one focused on whether records related to the company's 787 Dreamliner had been falsified, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Not long afterward, the Seattle Times reported that Boeing disclosed that employees at its assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C. had falsified records related.\n\nWhen reached for comment by Gizmodo, the FAA confirmed details of its probe.\n\n\"The FAA has opened an investigation into Boeing after the company voluntarily informed us in April that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes,\" the agency said, in an emailed statement. \"The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records. As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action -- as always -- to ensure the safety of the flying public.\"\n\nBoeing has publicly admitted that record falsification did occur. In a note originally shared internally at Boeing that was subsequently shared with Gizmodo, one of Boeing's executives, Scott Stocker -- who is 787 vice president and general manager at one of its South Carolina assembly plants -- explained a recent incident involving a Boeing teammate who had seen and reported \"irregularity\" at the plant. Stocker's statement partially reads:\n\nThe teammate saw what appeared to be an irregularity in a required conformance test in wing body join. He raised it with his manager, who brought it to the attention of executive leadership. I wanted to personally thank and commend that teammate for doing the right thing.

The company publicly disclosed this after news broke of yet another federal investigation into the company.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration revealed on Monday that it was conducting a new probe into the embattled airplane manufacturer -- this one focused on whether records related to the company's 787 Dreamliner had been falsified, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Not long afterward, the Seattle Times reported that Boeing disclosed that employees at its assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C. had falsified records related.\n\nWhen reached for comment by Gizmodo, the FAA confirmed details of its probe.\n\n\"The FAA has opened an investigation into Boeing after the company voluntarily informed us in April that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes,\" the agency said, in an emailed statement. \"The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records. As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action -- as always -- to ensure the safety of the flying public.\"\n\nBoeing has publicly admitted that record falsification did occur. In a note originally shared internally at Boeing that was subsequently shared with Gizmodo, one of Boeing's executives, Scott Stocker -- who is 787 vice president and general manager at one of its South Carolina assembly plants -- explained a recent incident involving a Boeing teammate who had seen and reported \"irregularity\" at the plant. Stocker's statement partially reads:\n\nThe teammate saw what appeared to be an irregularity in a required conformance test in wing body join. He raised it with his manager, who brought it to the attention of executive leadership. I wanted to personally thank and commend that teammate for doing the right thing.

It was the third serious incident involving one of the aviation giant's aircraft in just two days, the Daily Mail noted.Bad news has dogged Boeing for the past few years, undermining its profits and driving down its share price.Earlier this week, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) opened a new probe into whether the Seattle-based corporation broke rules during inspections of its long-haul B787 Dreamliner passenger jet, and whether its employees falsified aircraft records.The FAA announced last month that Boeing had \"voluntarily\" revealed that some of its employees had not performed required tests to confirm adequate bonding and grounding of the fasteners connecting the wings to the fuselage, and had then falsely reported the checks had been completed.Quoting a source familiar with the issue, CBS News said as many as 450 aircraft could be affected, including around 60 airframes still on the production line. According to the FAA, the aircraft still in Boeing's possession are undergoing re-inspection, while the company maintains that the reported \"misconduct\" would not pose an \"immediate safety-of-flight issue.\"Whistleblowers Raise Alarm Over Boeing Aircraft DefectsThe FAA's latest inquiry comes on the heels of a US Congressional investigation into the safety culture and manufacturing standards at Boeing. Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, told Congress last month that the industrial giant was cutting corners to speed up production -- which is fraught with acute safety risks.The whistle-blower also complained that Boeing employees raising red flags over quality issues were \"ignored, marginalized, threatened, sidelined and worse.\" He told Congress that he was afraid of being subjected to \"physical violence\" after exposing the aerospace corporation's flaws.Two other Boeing whistleblowers, Joshua Dean, former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and John \"Mitch\" Barnett, a former Boeing employee, passed away in May and March, respectively. Dean died after a short illness, while Barnett was found dead in an apparent suicide.Barnett and Dean both raised the alarm over manufacturing defects in Boeing's 737 Max and other planes, after a series of crashes involving the aircraft.In January, all 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes were temporarily grounded by the FAA after a door panel blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight. The same month, an oxygen leak was discovered on board a Boeing 737. Remarkably, the aircraft was scheduled to carry US Secretary of State Antony Blinken from the Davos World Economic Forum.At least ten more whistle-blowers, including former and current employees, are ready to testify against the aerospace company, the Independent reported, quoting lawyers for both Dean and Barnett.US Russia Sanctions Backfired on BoeingEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Boeing is facing a new problem stemming from anti-Russia sanctions, imposed by the US over Moscow's special operation in Ukraine. As a result, the industrial giant cannot deliver enough B787 Dreamliners.According to the WSJ, the trouble was caused by a lack of heat exchangers - temperature-regulating parts for the B787 - which were previously produced in Russia. Even though the production was shifted to the US and the UK, new factories have proven incapable of keeping up with demand.Boeing's inability to obtain enough heat exchangers disrupted the pace of Dreamliner manufacturing. The company was forced to warn investors that it will not deliver as many planes as anticipated this year. American Airlines blamed Dreamliner delays for its decision to suspend some international and long-haul flights this year and next.Boeing also severed ties with a major Russian titanium supplier and halted selling spare parts and maintenance services to Russian airlines that operate its passenger planes.The WSJ admitted that US anti-Russia sanctions significantly backfired on Boeing and jet manufacturing in general, naming Russia \"a big player in the global aerospace supply chain.\"Boeing's Starliner Launch ScrubbedBoeing's space mission also faced obstacles on May 7, with the first manned launch of the company's Starliner to the International Space Station (ISS) being postponed by US aerospace manufacturer United Launch Alliance (ULA).According to NASA, the reason for aborting the launch was the need \"to complete data analysis on a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank of the Atlas 54 rocket's Centaur upper stage and determine whether it is necessary to replace the valve.\"NASA has reportedly re-scheduled the launch to May 17 at 6:16 p.m. ET to give time for technicians to replace the valve.Boeing Reflects US Manufacturing Industry FlawsCommenting on the scandals surrounding Boeing, Chinese daily newspaper Global Times alleged that the aerospace firm has suffered from \"the loss of skilled engineering talent and the reckless outsourcing of production processes to cut costs\" over the past few decades. However, the core problem lies in the industrial giant's shift it priorities from safety to profit, while cashing in on the reputation it had gained in previous decades, according to the daily.While the US is currently accusing China of disrupting its \"re-industrialization\" efforts, America's problems are homegrown, the newspaper pointed out. It added that Boeing is not the only American company to have compromised its standards for the sake of financial gains. The Chinese report advised US producers not to blame others for losing their competitive edge.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors":

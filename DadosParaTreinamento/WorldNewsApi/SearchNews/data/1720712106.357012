{"id": 231934248, "title": "Can Narendra Modi Successfully Navigate The Challenges Of Coalition Government?", "text": "There are questions about whether Narendra Modi can run a coalition government. The BJP has not secured a full majority for the third consecutive term. Modi has led a majority government for 23 years, from Gandhinagar to Delhi. Some doubt his ability to manage a coalition.Many on social media are discussing whether Modi can rely on leaders like Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar. Memes are circulating, comparing him to movie characters. However, looking at Modis career since the 1990s, these doubts may be unfounded.Modi was active in politics by the 1990s and played a key role in the Ram Rath Yatra. He was known as a good organiser within BJP and RSS circles. Despite doubts, he became a mass leader in India and globally.In 2001, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave Modi the chance to lead the BJP government in Gujarat. There were concerns about his ability to handle internal party conflicts and win elections. Yet, Modi became the face of Gujarat BJP and ruled the state for 14 years.In 2013, BJP presented Modi as their Prime Minister candidate. When he became Prime Minister in 2014, some doubted his ability to manage national politics. However, he led the country for ten years, facing opposition but maintaining his position.Modis leadership helped NDA return to power for a third term, equalling Jawaharlal Nehrus record. Critics said Modi couldnt handle global politics when he first took office. But in 2014, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly and aimed to change global politics.Today, India makes decisions based on its interests, with global powers taking Modis opinions seriously. His influence is significant in international matters. Many countries seek his advice on serious issues.Modis political personality is influential. He builds trust and consensus through arguments rather than imposing his views directly. In todays political scenario, forming a government without BJP is almost impossible.Modi knows that leading a coalition government wont be easy for leaders like Naidu and Nitish to oppose. Upcoming assembly elections will be held in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jharkhand. BJP has a coalition government in one state and its own government in another.If BJP forms governments in two of these states during Modis tenure, it will strengthen his position further. With nearly four decades of political experience, Modi will avoid making allies uncomfortable while pursuing his agendas.", "summary": "There are questions about whether Narendra Modi can run a coalition government.

Finishing on the podium is often an added advantage, but even qualifying, in itself, deserves some plaudits.\n\nFor Favour Ofili, she thought that 2024 would be the year she would finally make her debut at the games. She will, but not in every discipline she had prepared for.\n\nIt is one thing to fail to hit the qualification mark, and it is another thing to qualify but fail to get registered before the deadlines. Ofili took to social media to painfully explain how she had been informed that she wouldn't participate in the women's 100m.\n\nUnlike in 2020, when she was banned entirely -- for yet another case of incompetence by the authorities -- she will have the chance to compete in the 200m and the 4 by 100m relays. It is a case of the glass being half full, but it doesn't make the fact that she won't run in the 100m any better.\n\nWho is Favour Ofili? As Legit.ng delves into it, the 21-year-old is a talented sprinter born in Port Harcourt. She started her career in the 400m, where she won silver at the 2019 African Games held in Rabat, Morocco. She then followed that up with gold in the 4 by 400m relays in the same event.\n\nA year before the Rabat Games, she won two gold medals in the 400m and 200m at the Africa Youth Championships in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, in addition to the one she had won in Algiers in 2018.\n\nOfili was declared the best female athlete of the meet in the 2019 Games.\n\nHer performances in Abidjan saw her qualify for the World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, where she reached the semi-finals as the youngest athlete.\n\nThe rising star would later earn a scholarship at Louisiana State University, a reputable college for track and field stars in Baton Rouge, America.\n\nOfili added three medals to her growing CV when she won two bronze(200m and 4 by 100m relay) and gold(4 by 400m) at the world U-20 Championships held in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe Nigerian would undergo a slight change in her preferred disciplines. She started to run more 100m and 200m. She ran at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, where she narrowly missed out on a podium place in the 4 by 100m relay.\n\nOfili would correct that a few days later at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, where she finished second in the 200m behind the fastest woman alive, Elaine Thompson-Herah. The Nigerian relay team also set a new area record as they stormed to victory in the 4 by 100m.\n\nShe didn't perform satisfactorily at the World Championships in Budapest last year or the African Championships last month.\n\nThat notwithstanding, her achievements as a 21-year-old have proven that she is a star and deserved a chance to participate in all the events she had trained for the Paris Olympics.\n\nHow this setback affects her remains to be seen when she takes to the track on August 4 for round one of the women's 200m.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title":

This egregious error, attributed to the negligence of both the Athletic Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), is not merely a clerical oversight but a grave injustice to an athlete who has dedicated years to representing her nation at the highest level.\n\nOfili, a 21-year-old sprinter with a promising career ahead, qualified for both the 100m and 200m events. Her exclusion from the 100m race due to administrative failures is nothing short of scandalous. The young athlete's frustration is palpable in her social media post, where she rightly questions the point of her four-year effort to earn this opportunity.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. It is a recurring nightmare for Nigerian athletes. In the previous Olympic Games, 14 Nigerian athletes were barred from competing due to inadequate testing provisions - another failure laid at the feet of the AFN, NOC, and the Nigerian Anti-Doping Committee (NADC). The pattern of neglect and incompetence is clear and deeply troubling.\n\nSuch repeated failures not only crush the dreams of individual athletes but also tarnish the reputation of Nigerian sports on the global stage. It is no wonder that many talented Nigerian athletes choose to represent other nations at the earliest opportunity. Examples abound, such as Salwa Eid Naser (formerly Ebelechukwu Agbapuonwu), who now competes for Bahrain, and Gloria Alozie, who switched allegiance to Spain. These talented individuals felt compelled to seek better support and opportunities elsewhere, depriving Nigeria of potential Olympic glory.\n\nThe Nigerian women's basketball team's experience further illustrates this systemic problem. Despite their dominance in African basketball, the team faced numerous challenges in their Olympic preparation. From logistical nightmares to subpar accommodations, their journey to the Games was marred by a lack of support from their own federation. Even their participation in the opening ceremony was denied at the last minute, disrupting their training schedule.\n\nThese incidents paint a picture of a sports administration that is not just inefficient but actively harmful to the athletes it should be supporting. The government must address this issue urgently. It is not enough to celebrate when athletes win medals; the entire system needs an overhaul to ensure that athletes are given every opportunity to succeed.\n\nThe AFN, NOC, and NADC must be held accountable for their failures. There should be a thorough investigation into how Ofili's name was left off the entry list, and those responsible should face consequences. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the sports administration system is necessary to prevent such mishaps in the future.\n\nNigerian athletes deserve better. They train tirelessly, make countless sacrifices, and carry the hopes of a nation on their shoulders. The least they can expect is competent administration that ensures they can compete on the global stage they have rightfully earned.\n\nIt is time for the Nigerian government to take decisive action. The future of Nigerian athletics - and indeed, all Nigerian sports - depends on creating a system that supports and empowers athletes rather than hindering them. Until then, we risk losing more talent to other nations and squandering the immense potential of Nigerian sports.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jude_obafemi@thewillnews.com", "name": "Jude Obafemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favour_Ofili", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Favour Ofili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_Federation_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athletics Federation of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salwa_Eid_Naser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salwa Eid Naser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4283.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777828", "eventUri": "eng-9777828", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

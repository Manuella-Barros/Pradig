We did not know that when our son went to war, he would bring something. We are in grief, but at the same time grateful to the Government. The gesture comforts us,\" he said.\n\nA relative, Mr Makani Sithole, said the family has lost someone who was ever supportive.\n\n\"He was a pillar of the family, and no one will be able to fill his shoes. He used to pay tuition fees for relatives, and he would reside with some of them until they could fully support themselves.\n\n\"We grew up together, and we never had an argument, our relationship was strong,\" he said.\n\nA church member and colleague, Madzibaba William, said they first met with Cde Chaunoita in the early 1990s in the Johane Marange Apostolic Sect.\n\n\"We used to fellowship together and he was someone who was dedicated and believed in his religion. Yes, the road was not smooth, there were temptations along the way, but he remained faithful to his God until his death, and that itself speaks volumes about his faith,\" he said.\n\nYoung brother to Cde Chaunoita, Mr Felix Pedzisai Chabveyo, said his brother was a devoted member of the Apostolic sect. \"We were all born worshipping in the Johane Marange Apostolic sect, and he only took a break when he went to fight in the liberation war. He came back from the war in 1980 and continued with his church.\n\nCde Chaunoita was born on June 1, 1958, in Gutu District, Masvingo Province.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1969, he attended Gudo Primary School in Gutu, for Sub A to Standard One and subsequently transferred to Mataruse Primary School in the same province in 1970, where he completed primary education.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1972, Cde Chaunoita was at Gutu Secondary School where he did Form One and Two. However, due to financial constraints, he did not continue with his secondary education.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1974, Cde Chaunoita engaged in menial jobs in Gutu and it was the period that he experienced the brutality of the white settlers.\n\nOutraged by the enactment of suppressive laws such as the Land Husbandry Act and the Tax Act, among others, by the white settler regime, and the continued wanton and unjust racial segregation in the then Rhodesia, Cde Chaunoita together with five other valiant youths from Gutu, left the country in September 1975 for Mozambique to join the armed struggle, under ZANLA.\n\nThe group comprised Brigadier General Retired Charles Hwekwete, the late Colonel Masocha, the late Amen Sithole and two others.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw",

Zanu-PF National Political Commissar, Cde Mike Bimha, delivered the national hero status message to the Chaunoita family in Harare yesterday.\n\n\"His Excellency, the President and First Secretary of Zanu-PF, Cde Dr ED Mnangagwa has conferred National Hero status to the late Cde Ezekiel Tobias Musiiwa Chaunoita who died on 4 May 2024. The late Cde Chaunoita will be interred at the National Heroes' Acre, Harare, at a date to be announced,\" said Cde Bimha.\n\nCde Chaunoita's elder brother, Mr Kainos Chaunoita expressed gratitude to Government for the hero status. \"As a family, we thank our Government and President Mnangagwa for conferring our son this respect. We did not know that when our son went to war, he would bring something. We are in grief but at the same time grateful to the Government. The gesture comforts us,\" he said.\n\nHis younger brother, Mr Felix Pedzisai Chabveyo, said his brother was a devoted member of the Apostolic sect. \"We were all born worshipping in the Johane Marange Apostolic Sect, and he only took a break when he went to fight in the liberation war. This has always been his church until his death and even today, his family has not known any other church besides Marange,\" he said.\n\nCde Chaunota was born on June 1, 1958, in Gutu District, Masvingo Province. He did Sub A and Standard One at Gudo Primary School in Gutu from 1967-1969 and transferred to Mataruse Primary School in the same province in 1970 to complete primary education. Cde Chaunoita went to Gutu Secondary School for his Form 1 and Form 2 from 1971-1972, and did not continue with his secondary education due to financial constraints. He did menial jobs in Gutu from 1973-1974, and it was the period that he experienced the brutality of the white settlers.\n\nOutraged by the enactment of suppressive Acts such as the Land Husbandry Act and the Tax Act, among others, and continued wanton and unjust racial segregation, Cde Chaunoita together with five other youths from Gutu, left the country in September 1975 for Mozambique to join the armed struggle, under ZANLA. The group comprised Brigadier General (Rtd) Charles Hwekwete the late Colonel Masocha, the late Amen Sithole and two others. They crossed into Mozambique by foot via Machipanda without detection by the Rhodesian forces. Cde Chaunoita briefly stayed at Villa De Manica from September to December 1975, before transferring to Nyadzonia Camp where he received political orientation. On August 9, 1976, he survived the Nyadzonia massacre that left hundreds of comrades dead with others sustaining injuries.\n\nHe was transferred to Tembwe Camp for his initial three months military training and specialised in military engineering. He trained VIP security protection in Yugoslavia from January 1978 to August 1978. He returned to Mozambique and was deployed to Gaza Province where he served as a security detail to the ZANLA High Command. Here he brushed shoulders with the late National Heroes, Cde Menard Muzariri, Cde Elias Kanengoni and Cde Nash Dzimiri. In January 1979, he was deployed to Maputo Province where he was appointed Aide-De-Camp (ADC) to the late Vice President Simon Muzenda. He was then elevated to the General Staff of ZANLA.\n\nIn addition to being the ADC to Vice President Muzenda, the ZANLA leadership gave him other responsibilities. The added responsibilities were in recognition of Cde Chaunoita's experience and dedication to the liberation war and his leadership acumen. On December 29, 1979, Cde Chaunoita escorted the late General Josiah Tongogara from Maputo to his base in Chimoio to supervise ceasefire duties assigned to his troops. Cde Chaunoita and Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri survived the car accident that claimed the life of Gen Tongogara. In March 1980, Cde Chaunoita returned to Zimbabwe, and as a member of the General Staff and ADC to VP Muzenda, he did liaison duties between Zanu-PF and the President's Department.\n\nOn November 21, 1981, Cde Chaunoita was attested into the President's Department as a Senior Security Officer under the Internal Branch. In December 1981, he was sent to Romania for seven months where he trained in the field of clandestine investigations.\n\nHe was appointed Officer-In-Charge at the Harare International Airport Station in August 1982. On July 1, 1983, he was promoted to intelligence officer. He was transferred from the Internal Branch to the Security Branch where he was appointed to the rank of Deputy Director Security on July 1, 1984, with an oversight role of ensuring that all Divisions such as Presidential, Ministerial, Liaison, Provinces and Vetting worked in harmony.\n\nHe was promoted to the rank of Director Security on October 1, 2000. He was redeployed to the Director General's Office as Director on July 1, 2002, a post he held until he retired on June 30, 2020.", "source": {"uri": "chronicle.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title":

From January 1978 to August 1978, he was selected to undertake a VIP Protection Security Course in the Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nUpon his return in September 1978, Cde Chaunoita returned to Mozambique and was deployed to Gaza Province where he served as a security detail to the ZANLA High Command.\n\nDuring his stay in Mozambique, Cde Chaunoita, brushed shoulders with the likes of the late National Heroes, Cde Menard Muzariri, Cde Elias Kanengoni and Cde Nash Dzimiri, among others.\n\nIn January 1979, the national hero was deployed to Maputo Province where he was appointed Aide-De-Camp (ADC) to the late Vice President Cde Simon Muzenda.\n\nIt was also at that time that he was elevated to be a member of the General Staff of ZANLA.\n\nIn addition to being ADC to VP Muzenda, the ZANLA leadership gave him other responsibilities.\n\nThe added responsibilities were in recognition of Cde Chaunoita's experience and dedication to the liberation war and his leadership acumen.\n\nOn 29 December 1979, the national hero escorted the late General Magama Tongogara from Maputo to his base in Chimoio to supervise ceasefire duties assigned to his troops.\n\nSadly, on the same day, Cde Chaunoita together with Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri survived a horrific car accident that claimed the life of General Tongogara.\n\nIn March 1980, Cde Chaunoita returned to Zimbabwe and as a member of the General Staff and ADC to VP Muzenda. He was tasked to do liaison duties between Zanu PF and the President's Department.\n\nOn 21 November 1981, Cde Chaunoita was attested into the President's Department as a Senior Security Officer (SSO) under the Internal Branch. On completion of his initial training at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe School of Intelligence (RGMSI), he was then deployed.\n\nIn December 1981, Cde Chaunoita was sent to Romania for seven months where he trained in the field of clandestine investigations. He exhibited a high sense of responsibility and always led by example.\n\nHe had a great passion for his work and was a true leader and a team player. His loyalty to the organisation was unquestionable and was envied by many.\n\nThese attributes saw him being appointed officer-in-charge at the then Harare International Airport Station in August 1982. Cde Chaunoita's presence in the organisation was immediately felt, owing to his maturity, experience, and exemplary behaviour.\n\nHe quickly came to grips with the requirements of his duties and began to excel ahead of others in the execution of his duties.\n\nThus, on 1 July 1983, he was promoted to the rank of intelligence officer. Due to his experience, dedication, and loyalty as well as his ability to use the skills he got through training, he was transferred from the Internal Branch to the Security Branch where he was appointed to the rank of Deputy Director Security on 1 July 1984.\n\nCde Chaunoita's work history inspired many officers who worked with him as he was a fatherly figure whose counsel was sought after by his colleagues.\n\nIn this post, he had an oversight role of ensuring that all Divisions such as Presidential, Ministerial, Liaison, Provinces, and vetting among others worked efficiently and in harmony.\n\nIn recognition of his diligent service, the organisation's leadership promoted Cde Chaunoita to the rank of director and director security on 1 October 2000.\n\nIn all these assignments, he continued to exhibit an exceptional flair for intelligence and security operations, which saw him being redeployed to the Director-General's Office as director on 1 July 2002.\n\nThis is the post he held at the time of his retirement on June 30, 2020. Cde Chaunoita was a firm believer in the emancipation of the oppressed black Zimbabweans.\n\nHe was also a humble and compassionate leader who showed selfless dedication to the nation at large.\n\nHe was a true champion of the black empowerment thrust. To buttress this, he acquired Strathlore Farm in Goromonzi, Mashonaland East Province, where he was a renowned maize and wheat farmer.\n\nMourners are gathered at Number 19B Selsey Road, Waterfalls,

Starting as an aide-de-camp to the late Vice President Simon Muzenda, he was known for astute understanding of security and strategic matters.\n\nThis role was pivotal during a transformative period in Zimbabwe's history, requiring not only loyalty but also a deep commitment to the principles of the liberation movement.\n\nHis effectiveness in this capacity showcased his dedication and integrity, setting the stage for his rapid rise through the ranks.\n\nAscending to high echelons of power, Cde Chaunoita was appointed as the Director of Security within the President's Department, a testament to his exceptional skills and unwavering loyalty.\n\nIn this role, he was instrumental in shaping the security policies that would ensure the stability and security of the country.\n\nHis leadership style, characterised by a firm yet fair approach, earned him respect and admiration from his peers and subordinates alike.\n\nHis ability to navigate complex security landscapes contributed significantly to his legacy as a steadfast protector of the nation's sovereignty.\n\nThrough his strategic foresight and dedication, Cde Chaunoita not only safeguarded the physical security of Zimbabwe but also contributed to laying the foundational stones for its future prosperity.\n\nCde Chaunoita was not only a security strategist, but also a visionary whose leadership extended beyond the confines of Government duties.\n\nHis acquisition of Strathlore Farm in Goromonzi and subsequent success as a farmer underscored his commitment to Zimbabwe's black empowerment and economic independence.\n\nThis move was emblematic of his lifelong mission to uplift his fellow citizens and foster a self-sufficient Zimbabwe.\n\nIt is also crucial to highlight Cde Chaunoita's personal qualities, his humility, compassion, and paternal guidance which made him a respected figure not only within the corridors of power, but also in the hearts of those who knew him.\n\nHe was a mentor to many, his wisdom echoing through the generations he inspired.\n\nHis leadership style, characterised by both firmness and fairness, ensured that his influence would endure beyond his tenure in office.\n\nIn recognising Cde Chaunoita as a national hero, the President has not only honoured a man but has also reaffirmed the values that stand at the core of our nation: resilience, courage, and dedication to public service.\n\nThis gesture serves as a crucial reminder of our collective history and the individuals who have shaped it.\n\nIt is a call to all Zimbabweans to embody the spirit of Cde Chaunoita, to strive for excellence, to lead with integrity, and to commit ourselves to the continuous improvement of our great nation.\n\nAs we mourn the loss of such an outstanding leader and celebrate his monumental legacy, we are reminded of the impact that an individual can have on the destiny of a nation.\n\nHis life and achievements are not merely chapters in our national history;

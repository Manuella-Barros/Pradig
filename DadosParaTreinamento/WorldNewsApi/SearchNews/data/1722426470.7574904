{"id": 243374318, "title": "Euro Championship: Spain look good, Germany need more, England will be England", "text": "The 2024 UEFA Euro Championship round of 16 matches promises to be exciting, with the likelihood of more than half of the eight matches being decided on penalties. This prediction is based on the quality and psychology observed in the last group matches, where caution and fear were dominant factors. Many still consider France, led by the masked Kylian Mbappe, as top favourites, even though the first-round results did not fully support this view. Defending champions Italy needed a 98th-minute equaliser to raise their flag in the second round, and their manager, Luciano Spalletti, has shown signs of struggling under the pressure of expectations. Discussing England\u2019s performance might seem redundant, but the less said about Gareth Southgate\u2019s unfolding endgame, the better. Welcome to the round of 16; a stage filled with intrigue and high expectations. Round of 16 Matches 29 June 2024 Switzerland [19] vs. Italy [10], Olympiastadion, Berlin Germany [16] vs. Denmark [21], Westfalenstadion, Dortmund 30 June 2024 England [5] vs. Slovakia [45], Arena AufSchalke, Gelsenkirchen Spain [8] vs. Georgia [74], RheinEnergieStadion, Cologne 1 July 2024 France [2] vs. Belgium [3], Merkur Spiel-Arena, D\u00fcsseldorf Portugal [6] vs. Slovenia [57], Waldstadion, Frankfurt 2 July 2024 Romania [47] vs. Netherlands [7], Allianz Arena, Munich Austria [25] vs. Turkey [42], Red Bull Arena, Leipzig Match Previews Italy vs. Switzerland The round of 16 kicks off on Saturday. Italy, ranked No. 10 by FIFA, faces a confident Switzerland team, ranked 19. The Murat Yakin-led side showed composure in the first round and came through unbeaten. However, history favours the Azzurri, having won 10 of their 23 meetings, with their last defeat to the Swiss occurring over 30 years ago. Italy manager Spalletti expects his players to be more relaxed after qualifying from a tough group, while Switzerland\u2019s recent performance against Italy gives them hope. Expect a tight match that could be decided on penalties, favouring Italy. Germany vs. Denmark Germany will be under pressure from Denmark on Saturday. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s team went through a tough group phase, especially their last game against Switzerland, which should have prepared them for the Danish challenge. Historically, matches between these two teams have been close, and this one is not expected to be different. Head-to-head 02/06/21 FRI Germany 1 \u2013 1 Denmark 06/06/17 FRI Denmark 1 \u2013 1 Germany 17/06/12 UEC Denmark 1 \u2013 2 Germany 11/08/10 FRI Denmark 2 \u2013 2 Germany 27/03/07 FRI Germany 0 \u2013 1 Denmark 15/11/00 FRI Denmark 2 \u2013 1 Germany Nagelsmann believes the group stage taught his team to deal with different pressures. \u201cSo we have dealt with all types of matches. It\u2019s important to get to learn how to overcome difficult situations.\u201d Denmark have historically proven to be a tough opponent and the head-to-head comparison indicates another close match on Saturday. England vs. Slovakia In a normal scenario, there should be no cause for concern for Gareth Southgate and his players against Slovakia. However, England\u2019s performance in Germany has been lacklustre, with only two goals scored and one conceded and Slovakia, led by Francesco Calzona, will provide a stern test. READ ALSO: UCL Final: Real Madrid are kings of Europe again Calzona is one of five Italian managers in the round of 16 and he has firsthand knowledge of playing against English sides. What will Southgate do? Continue with his flawed experiments or be bold and give some new faces the chance to show they can play? Whichever side Southgate twists to on Sunday, it will still be an endgame scenario for the England manager and his players. Lest we forget, England cannot afford to be ousted on penalties! Spain vs. Georgia This is the most mismatched game in the round of 16, with Spain ranked 66 places higher than Georgia. The Crusaders, led by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, have been impressive in their group matches. However, if Spain scores first, it could be a long day for Georgia. They will need to defend well and capitalise on counter-attacks to stand any chance. France vs. Belgium This is the tightest encounter according to the rankings. Both teams have not lived up to their top rankings, with France dealing with off-pitch issues and Belgium struggling with their defence. Didier Deschamps looked jaded. Tension about the coming elections in France, Mbappe\u2019s broken nose and the colour of his mask, and the cooling of the relationship between Deschamps and Antoine Griezmann have been top of the news. For the Belgian side, the challenge has been getting Romelu Lukaku on the scoresheet after having three goals disallowed for marginal calls. Belgium\u2019s blundering and aged defence line will also be put under pressure by France\u2019s rapid attackers on Monday. This match could go either way and may be decided by fine margins. Portugal vs. Slovenia This is another seemingly lopsided encounter, with Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Portugal heavily favoured. However, Slovenia\u2019s recent performance, including a win against Portugal in March, suggests they can be tough opponents. This match could also go to penalties if Portugal\u2019s offensive struggles continue. Romania vs. Netherlands Despite the Netherlands\u2019 higher ranking, their performance has been underwhelming. Romania has shown they can compete, making this another match that might be decided on penalties. Austria vs. Turkey This could be the most exciting match of the round of 16. Austria, well-drilled and technically sound, face a flair-filled Turkey side. If Austria score first, they could dominate, but if Turkey score first, expect a resilient fight from Austria. Conclusion The round of 16 matches is set to deliver drama, excitement, and possibly numerous penalty shootouts. With historical rivalries and current form playing significant roles, each match will be a test of resilience and strategy.", "summary": "<img width=\"1080\" height=\"607\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/First-EURO-goal-@k.mbappe-EURO2024-e1719642923341.jpg?fit=1080%2C607&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"Kylian Mbappe (PHOTO CREDIT: Official Instagram Page @euro2024 via | https://www.instagram.com/p/C8papTjuwvt/?img_index=2)\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/First-EURO-goal-@k.mbappe-EURO2024-e1719642923341.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/First-EURO-goal-@k.mbappe-EURO2024-e1719642923341.jpg?resize=526%2C296&amp;ssl=1 526w, https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/First-EURO-goal-@k.mbappe-EURO2024-e1719642923341.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/First-EURO-goal-@k.mbappe", "url": "https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/708089-euro-championship-spain-look-good-germany-need-more-england-will-be-england.html", "image": "https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/06/First-EURO-goal-@k.mbappe-EURO2024-e1719642923341.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:42:59", "author": "Jide Alaka,Toyin Falola", "authors": ["Jide Alaka", "Toyin Falola"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.022}

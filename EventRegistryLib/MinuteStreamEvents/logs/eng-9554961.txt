While the has been taking measures to plant , it unfortunately tends to ignore them when they turn into trees.\n\nThe trees on Mata Amritanandamayi Ashram Road were damaged on Tuesday when workers were busy digging up to construct a drain along the road. Neither the contractor nor the BBMP was present while an earth moving machine was used to dig the pit for the of a drain along the road.\n\n\"It is nothing but killing of well-grown trees. One of the trees has come down crashing. Another tree is set to fall as its roots are damaged. It is the responsibility of the Department to select the right location for planting saplings.\n\nNurturing and protecting the saplings that grow into trees is also its responsibility. They are ruining the city,'' said Gowdaiah, an .\n\nExpressing concern over the damage to the well-grown trees, Marudachala Murthy, a resident of Bhuvaneshwari Nagar, said the contractor and the workers should be mindful about the importance of trees. \"It is a pain to see the trees in such a pathetic condition. The workers not only cut down one tree but also damaged a few more trees. The BBMP officials must take measures to save the remaining trees on the road,'' said Murthy. Every year, the BBMP Forest Department, environmental activists and school students have been planting saplings on the occasion of World Environment Day. The BBMP spends a huge amount to plant the saplings, procure tree guards and maintain its nurseries. However, no one is bothered to look after the trees in the city.\n\nComing down heavily on the BBMP Forest Department for its failure to prevent the cutting or damaging of trees by various departments and agencies, Vijay Nishanth aka tree doctor, asked what was the need of the BBMP Forest Department if it did not serve the purpose for which it exists. \"The BBMP Forest Department must take care of the remaining trees. If care is not taken, these trees may pose danger to motorists due to weakened or damaged roots during the monsoon,'' said Vijay Nishanth.\n\nWhen informed, BBMP Forest Range Officer Jagadish said he has been busy attending calls from the public on fallen trees in the city. \"I will send my subordinate to visit the spot soon,'' the BBMP Forest Range Officer said.

The majority of these incidents were reported from Bengaluru West zone (70 cases), followed by Bengaluru South (47 cases) and Bengaluru East (43 cases). RR Nagar and Bommanahalli also registered high numbers of these incidents.\n\nAccording to officials from BBMP's Forest Department, most of the uprooted trees were found to be rotten and hollow from the inside.\n\n\"Many trees that were uprooted on Monday looked perfectly healthy on the outside but had decayed and become hollow on the inside. This is highly likely due to careless execution of and development projects. While building roads and other infrastructure projects, we are also cutting lateral roots of avenue trees and concretising them up to trunks, leading to trees decaying,\" said BLG Swamy, Deputy Conservator of Forest, BBMP. Swamy also told BM that most of these trees were taller than usual.\n\nSun starved\n\nExperts say trees become taller when they are sunlight-starved. In an urban setup like Bengaluru, it may be due to high-rise buildings in the surroundings. Trees growing in the shade redirect their resources to reach for light and become taller. In this process, root development stalls as the tree focuses on growing tall and rising above neighbouring buildings or other trees to access sunlight.\n\nThey opine that reckless execution of infrastructure development projects would ensure more tree-falling incidents in the future.\n\n\"Lateral roots of trees are also called prop roots and they form the main support system. Cutting or damaging lateral roots severs mechanical support to the branches, compromising a tree's balancing act. Mindless acts such as causing damage to the root system and slathering concrete on the base of trees would only lead to avenue trees from the inside and falling even during moderate-intensity wind speed. These factors coupled with excessive dehydration due to high temperature and lack of rainfall are important reasons leading to hundreds of trees falling,\" said , a botanist.\n\nInfra damage\n\nCity-based tree activists, on multiple occasions in the past, have raised concerns over avenue trees sustaining root damage owing to development activities such as road widening, flyover construction, metro track extension, etc. They underline there is a lack of awareness about trees 'physiology among BBMP engineers.\n\nAdditionally, the Road Infrastructure Department does not appear to be consulting the Forest Department before taking projects on ground.\n\n\"It is evident that the Road Infrastructure Department is not exercising care while executing work on ground. They are not just damaging the roots of avenue trees while digging the roads, but also concretizing them mindlessly. Such acts would destroy the city's remaining green cover. While the Forest Department of BBMP appears to be putting in sincere efforts to preserve Bangalore's trees, other departments are not reciprocating,\" said , trustee of Bangalore Environment Trust.\n\nTold you so\n\nGulab Pasha, a civic activist, highlighted inaction by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) against a request for a dying tree to be cut, in order to ensure it does not fall abruptly and cause severe damage. On the same day the activist voiced out his unrest over inaction on X, the said tree bit the dust. While Pasha raised a complaint with the BBMP, the authorities did not provide a response to the issue on time. The activist also put out a video the ill tree on X and urged the municipal body to take immediate action.\n\n\"The tree is over 50 feet tall and present on a road that recieves a significant amount of traffic. This is in the Banashankari ward, Umarbagh layout area. I am urging the forest department to deput officials to ensure the tree is cut as it has been eaten out from the inside by mites and the fall can cause severe damage,\" he says in the video. On the same evening, the tree fell after the downpour and heavy wind. Pasha followed up with a video of the fallen tree and demanded accountability from the authorities for the damage of power cables and vehicles that were parked nearby.", "source": {"uri": "bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangalore Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruhat_Bengaluru_Mahanagara_Palike", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radioactive decay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bommanahalli", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bommanahalli"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bommanahalli"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-rise_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-rise building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banashankari", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banashankari"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(electoral_subdivision)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ward (electoral subdivision)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overpass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physiology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Horticulture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Horticulture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Durian", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Durian", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-178358,msid-109926932/109926932.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554961", "eventUri": "eng-9554961", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Manjunath alleges that the civic body has not cleared approved bills for over a month now\n\nThe Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has halted the contractor payment process after the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) came into force on March 16. The BBMP stopped approving new payments for the works completed between 2019-20 and 2022-23. The works were executed under the BBMP grants.\n\nBBMP Special Commissioner (finance), Shivananda Kalakere told The Hindu: \"We halted the process of issuing fresh approvals for the payments as MCC came into being.\" He said the payments of earlier approved bills were almost cleared.\n\nMr. Kalakere said he would shortly be inviting the contractors for a meeting to discuss payments and randomisation. It should be noted that contractors have expressed unhappiness over BBMP bringing back randomisation and the TVCC inspection system which was stopped after the Special Investigation Teams (SIT) were formed. Now, as the SITs are dissolved and Justice H.N. Nagamohan Das has expressed helplessness to probe within the stipulated deadline set by the High Court, the BBMP has brought back the randomisation system.\n\nThe BBMP Contractors' Association president, K.T. Manjunath alleged that the civic body has not cleared approved bills for over a month now. \"The MCC will not apply for clearing the bills which were already approved. The BBMP had told contractors that bills were approved,\" he alleged.\n\nMr. Manjunath further alleged that the BBMP received oral instructions from the government to freeze payments during elections. \"The contractors are facing harassment from the civic body and this has to stop. On the other hand, there was no requirement for reintroducing randomisation and TVCC as the defect and liability period has ended for the completed work. What is point of inspection again to clear the bills?,\" he asked.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruhat_Bengaluru_Mahanagara_Palike", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marylebone Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022\u201323_Indian_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022\u201323 Indian Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_Indian_Super_League_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 Indian Super League season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Investigation_Team_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special Investigation Team (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554961", "eventUri": "eng-9554961", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-16", "textStart": 282, "textEnd": 290}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The deluge, which lasted from around 5 PM, resulted in fallen trees, blocked roads, and extensive property damage, creating chaotic scenes that quickly spread across social media.\n\nThe sudden landslide disrupted the roadway adjacent to the metro site, completely severing the connection between the two ends of the road. Authorities have since barricaded the affected area and closed the road to all traffic.\n\nBengaluru rains create havoc: Cyclone triggers hailstorm, fallen trees disrupt traffic\n\nThe storm, characterized by fierce winds and heavy rain, lasted between 20 to 30 minutes, causing widespread damage, particularly in the eastern parts of the city and Rajarajeshwari Nagar. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) reported that the Rajarajeshwari Nagar area alone saw 70 trees and large branches come down, while 24 fell in the eastern zone and 30 in the western zone, amounting to over 150 incidents citywide.\n\nDespite an average rainfall of just 1.4 cm across the city, certain areas recorded much higher totals. Dodda Bidarkal topped the chart with 6.6 cm of rainfall, followed by 5.1 cm in both Nayandanahalli and RR Nagar, among others. The uneven distribution of rain led to acute effects in some neighbourhoods, exacerbating the impact on residents and infrastructure.\n\nOne severe incident occurred in Vasantnagar, where a tree fell onto an auto-rickshaw due to the storm, destroying the vehicle. The driver narrowly escaped with minor injuries. This event is just one of many where falling trees caused substantial damage to vehicles throughout the city. The intense rainfall also overwhelmed the city's drainage system, resulting in heavy water flow over roads, underpasses, and flyovers, leaving many motorists stranded.\n\nKarnataka: Bengaluru's water woes worsen as over 100 lakes dry up, over 20 on the brink\n\nFollowing the storm, the city corporation's helpline was inundated with over 200 complaints, primarily concerning fallen trees and waterlogged streets, indicating the scale of the exigency faced by municipal services and first responders.\n\nCity officials continue to assess the damage and coordinate cleanup and repair efforts. Residents are urged to report any new incidents of blockages or damage, as the city works to return to normalcy. The BBMP has been actively updating the public and coordinating with emergency services to manage the aftermath of the storm and ensure safety for all residents in the affected areas.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajarajeshwari_Nagar,_Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Bangalore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruhat_Bengaluru_Mahanagara_Palike", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto rickshaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overpass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tunnel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01h58vbq0w4pjp3rzv867dv6rk/rain.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554961", "eventUri": "eng-9554961", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

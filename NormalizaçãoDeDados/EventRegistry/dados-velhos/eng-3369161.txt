Hopefully I get another call-up.\"\n\nExplaining the decision to omit Burke from the squad to face England at Hampden in June, Strachan said: \"I think the expectation from myself, the media and fans has maybe put too much on him.\"\n\nBurke does not feel international honours came too soon, but relished the opportunity to appear instead for the national under-20s side at the Toulon Tournament, where he helped the Scots to a famous victory over their Brazilian counterparts.\n\n\"For us it was a very good tournament, we did very well,\" said the 20-year-old. \"For me, I got a lot of confidence in myself as a player, just enjoying myself, being free and enjoying my football.\n\n\"I thought it was great and the team were very good. I knew a few of my team-mates from past squads and from Nottingham Forest so it was nice.\"\n\nThe transfer fee Burke commanded when moving from Forest to Leipzig was the highest ever paid for a Scottish player.\n\n\"To be honest I didn't have a clue that I was the most expensive Scottish player,\" he said. \"It's not something that comes into my head.\n\nAlthough he made 25 Bundesliga appearances last season, most of the action he saw was off the bench, with only five league starts. More game-time is priority number one this season.\n\n\"My first year in Germany has been something different for me. I think it's been a big step for me, a different style of football, and I think it's been good. It was a very up and down season for me.\n\n\"Obviously I want to be playing more football and more games but the more learning I do the more I get to know the team.\n\n\"I think it's very difficult when you're constantly on the bench and waiting for your time to come on and make an impression.\n\n\"Every footballer wants to be in a starting position on the pitch. I need to get that really to get the confidence.\n\n\"To become a better player it's all about the minutes on the pitch and that's important this season.

Other people have to stand up. Almost everybody (else) is fit.\"\n\n\"It is hard to say [how long Zaha will be out for], he is a very robust player.\n\n\"It is still quite difficult to say how long it is going to take but I know Wilf is a player who wants to get fit again as soon as possible.\n\n\"I don't know, we have to wait. He is very robust. Normally a player with that kind of injury cannot cope until the end of the game and play 90 minutes.\n\n\"I think he had his challenge 20 or 30 minutes earlier and he still played the full 90 minutes.

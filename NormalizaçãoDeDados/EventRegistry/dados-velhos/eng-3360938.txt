And of course, absolute brutality was there.\n\nLesnar stepped into the ring along with Paul Heyman talking about SummerSlam and the alleged conspiracy by WWE and Raw General Manager Kurt Angle to take the title from the Beast. Walked in Samoa Joe and Braun Strowman talking about last episode's Last Man Standing match. And just in the two tried proving their power over either and in came Roman Reigns with his lethal spear striking down Samoa Joe. Sort of a revenge for last week's Coquina Clutch that had cost him the match against Strowman.\n\nAnd then, bang! Powerslam by the Monster on the Big Dog. Then it was just Strowman and Lesnar in the ring. It is the Beast looking eye-to-eye to the Monster. Guards were already kept outside the ring by Kurt Angle and they made their way in as fast as possible to separate out the two before could turn absolutely destructive. Soon, the entire Raw locker room emptied itself to stop the Lesnar and Strowman after the latter briefly cut through to make his way up to the champion to blow a few punches.\n\nBrock Lesnar is said to face a Fatal 4-way match against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe at WWE SummerSlam, at Barclay Centre New York, on August 20.", "id": "9330324", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "WATCH: Brock Lesnar comes face-to-face with Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe a week ahead of WWE SummerSlam", "image": "http://ste.india.com/sites/default/files/2017/08/15/616992-wwe-raw-grab-2.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1491, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1500}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "52726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "id": "303298", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "id": "315017", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "id": "315019", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "id": "326957", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "id": "331294", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types"}, {"label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "id": "332492", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "id": "340572", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "id": "349082", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling holds"}, "id": "358615", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_holds"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "id": "374391", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman"}, {"label": {"eng": "SummerSlam (2013)"}, "id": "378643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling authority figures"}, "id": "383336", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_authority_figures"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kurt Angle"}, "id": "498961", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Angle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Powerslam"}, "id": "540007", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerslam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "id": "1272200", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 255, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 954, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding"}], "time": "17:44:00"}

The highlight of the show The face-to-face-to-face-to-face encounter between Universal Champion Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe which didn't stay civil for long.\n\nHowever, the night began with, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins were brought back together after fighting it out. This was after Cesaro & Sheamus decided to attack their rivals leaving Raw General Manager Kurt Angle immediately sanctioned a Tag Team Title Match between the two duos at SummerSlam.\n\nLater on, Sasha Banks defeated Nia Jax to earn the opportunity to challenge Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss at SummerSlam. Also, Akira Tozawa defeated Neville to become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion.\n\nBut it was in the main event in the evening where chaos erupted between Universal Champion Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe, six nights before their monumental Fatal 4-Way Match at SummerSlam.\n\nLesnar's challengers surfaced one by one: first Samoa Joe, then Braun Strowman and finally Roman Reigns. The Big Dog quickly speared Joe in retaliation for The Samoan Submission Machine costing him his Last Man Standing Match against The Gift of Destruction the week prior, and Strowman disposed of Reigns with a Running Powerslam.\n\nThat left The Beast and The Monster Among Men alone in the ring, and while they made quick work of the legion of security Kurt Angle had hired to enclose the ring, the near-entirety of the Raw locker room barely managed to separate them, though Lesnar and Strowman briefly broke free to land a few wild punches. The rest will have to wait until Sunday and the titanic main event that could change Raw as we know it.\n\nRAW Results:\n\nBray Wyatt defeated Finn B\u00e1lor\n\nMickie James defeated Emma\n\nJason

That possibility hangs like a giant axe over this match. But the energy and excitement for this Universal championship match didn't begin just a few weeks ago. No, the path to this Fatal 4-Way is a long, intertwined patchwork involving all four participants, with significant history dating back to early 2015. There's animosity going in every single direction between these four behemoths in the ring, but the central conflict in the middle of it all is Reigns vs. Lesnar, and the unfinished business they have with one another.\n\nLet's take it back to January 2015 when Reigns won the Royal Rumble and got booed out of Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center despite The Rock raising his arm at the close of the show. The build-up to the WrestleMania 31 match between Reigns and then-WWE champion Lesnar was, at best, polarizing and controversial. A lot of fans in Santa Clara seemed poised to boo Reigns out of Levi's Stadium too, until Seth Rollins did the unthinkable and cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase mid-main event, stealing the title away.\n\nBoth Lesnar and Reigns were in a triple-threat WWE championship No. 1 contenders match in 2016 featuring Dean Ambrose (won by Reigns) and both men were in the last two Royal Rumbles, but there hasn't been a clash of this magnitude since their spoiled match at WrestleMania 31. Rumors abound of a future one-on-one match, but for the time being, this Fatal 4-Way offers far more permutations.\n\nReigns has history with the other two participants in this match as well. In Samoa Joe's first match on the main roster, Joe beat Reigns on Monday Night Raw in February -- and Joe got the better of Reigns twice more in June; Joe won a Fatal 5-Way at Extreme Rules that earned him a shot at Lesnar and the Universal title at Great Balls of Fire, and then beat Reigns again two weeks later on Raw. Their Universal title No. 1 contender's match in mid-July ended in a no contest after Braun Strowman returned, which was the main catalyst for this four-way.\n\nThe brightest and most intense animosity hangs between Strowman and Reigns, who have had several of the most intense WWE matches of the year thus far. They faced off as far back as October 2015, when Reigns was the first to defeat Strowman (via countout) in the midst of the Wyatt Family vs. The Shield rivalry, but this rivalry was truly ignited at Fastlane this past March.\n\nReigns gave Strowman his first pinfall loss in the WWE, and Strowman hasn't stopped chasing him ever since. Strowman pushed Reigns off a loading dock while he was strapped to a stretcher and tipped over the ambulance he was put inside. Reigns backed an ambulance up at high speed into a trailer a few months later. And still, Strowman wasn't finished with Reigns quite yet.\n\nBetween the history and animosity among all those combinations, there's more than enough heat to go around. Add in the unknown of Lesnar vs. Strowman and Joe vs. Strowman, and there's a lot to work with here. Without having to rely simply on himself to get through this match, this main event can carry on far longer than your average Lesnar match as well, if need be.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Lesnar walks out without the title and walks out of WWE again, but if the last couple of years have taught us anything, it's that the WWE isn't afraid to take a big chance. One year after the Barclays Center crowd inexplicably and loudly booed the design and color of the new Universal championship, taking away from a big moment for Rollins and Finn Balor, this match will be a far more popular spectacle.\n\nNo words necessary. Just a SPEAR from @WWERomanReigns! #RAW #SummerSlam pic.twitter.com/qCEdQEcU09\n\n- WWE (@WWE) August 15, 2017\n\n\"That's going to be a pretty interesting situation. I can't recall a time where you had four guys all sort of having this monster build, all in the same way.\"\n\n\"Brock Lesnar is Brock Lensar. You don't need to say more than that.\"\n\n\"Roman Reigns, whether people love him or hate him ... he's the guy.\"\n\n\"Samoa Joe, since he's come to WWE, has just become this unstoppable force with his match with Lesnar, and taking Lesnar as far as he did, and what he's done with Roman and Braun.\"\n\n\"Then there's Braun Strowman who has very quickly become this, he calls himself the monster among men, and it's hard to argue that he isn't when you talk about a guy with that size and that level of strength, but that when you see him run across the ring and the speed at which he does it, his ability to throw guys around, I hate to say it because it's a different style, but it's almost Lesnar-eqsque, seeing a guy that big... trust me, when you're in a ring with a guy and he's that size, he's not supposed to be able to move that fast. And that's the way you feel like when you're in the ring with Lesnar.\"\n\n\"Add into that the Jon Jones challenge and everything else, Lesnar doesn't have to get beat here. If he just doesn't win, that's all that matters. It's a really cool dynamic that you don't know what is going to happen.\"\n\n\"You have four guys in there, all over the 260 mark, everybody in there is agile, and can move, and is fast. These are athletes. These aren't plodding guys lumbering around the ring. This is speed and quickness. They move like cruiserweights, but they're not. It's a whole new world, in that manner.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy absence post-WrestleMania, Lesnar and Heyman have settled right back into the pocket over the last month or so. Getting into the ring with guys his own size gives Lesnar a lot more to work with, and with three of them in play, expect to see some vintage Lesnar (sorry Michael Cole).\n\nAs much as the talk about a Lesnar-Jon Jones UFC superfight has grown legs, and seems especially likely in a world where Mayweather-McGregor is a reality, Lesnar still has several months of his previous USADA suspension to serve out before he can even think of stepping back into the octagon. That fight will happen, but emerging from this match with a new rival (or an old one) and starting his path to the WrestleMania 34 main event seems the likeliest scenario in this match.\n\nStrowman seems like the least likely to emerge from this match as Universal champion, if for the simple fact that he doesn't really need a world title right now. A strong showing in this match would be a perfectly acceptable outcome, and if it sets the stage for a future one-on-one match with Lesnar some time between now and WrestleMania, all the better.\n\nIf, somehow, he emerges victorious here, it's hard to imagine a scenario where anyone outside of this quartet (most likely Reigns) could take that title off of him. Strowman's grown by leaps and bounds over the last year, and he can go with any of the top guys on Raw right now. It simply feels like he needs to get a few more big matches under his belt (and this one could go a long way) before he becomes the top guy on Raw.\n\nThe Brooklyn crowd, at its very best, can be described as impatient over the last few years. A Reigns victory would likely end with a showering of boos and a lot of the same old arguments being made against \"the big dog\". While I, for one, have heard the words \"dog\" and \"yard\" enough for two lifetimes, the Reigns hate overall has grown tired. As long as there's a creative end-game in play, with Lesnar perhaps coming back at Royal Rumble or WrestleMania, there's no reason Reigns can't leave this match as the winner.\n\nThe conflict with Strowman still seems to have a little bit of fire underneath it, and with Strowman and Joe sticking around to chase him in Lesnar's absence, there are plenty of ways things could play out in the last few months of 2017 with Reigns on top.\n\nAfter a bit of bad luck and some uncertainty at the very beginning of his main roster run, Samoa Joe has turned it up to 11 in his chase of Lesnar and the Universal championship. He pushed the champ hard at Great Balls of Fire, and everything leading up to and after that event screams of Joe being a long-time fixture in the main event.\n\nA win for Joe would come as something of a shock on Sunday, but there's no doubt he's done everything right to get himself to the spot he's in right now. If something screwy happens, like a Paul Heyman double-cross that I'm not sure WWE's in a position to pull off at this moment, Joe could do a lot of good carrying the title into the fall.\n\nBoth Strowman and Samoa Joe will be competing at their first SummerSlam. Only two superstars in WWE history have won a world title in their SummerSlam debut. Lesnar defeated The Rock for the WWE Championship in 2002, and Balor defeated Rollins to become the inaugural Universal champion in 2016.

The extended weekend will feature four shows in as many nights, with NXT TakeOver on August 18th, SummerSlam on the 19th, and Raw and SmackDown on the 20th and 21st respectively.\n\nThough the NY Post broke the news, WWE have since followed up with an article on their own official website. The announcement comes days before this year's four-day run of shows, kicking off with NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III on Saturday, 19th August.\n\nHolding SummerSlam at the Barclays Center has been a resounding commercial success for WWE. The event was first held there in 2015, and tickets have either sold out or come close to doing so almost as soon as they're put on sale every year. Los Angeles' Staples Center was SummerSlam's home prior to this, having hosted the event every year from 2009 to 2014.", "id": "9221854", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "WWE SummerSlam 2018 Returning To Brooklyn", "image": "https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2017/08/4f16b33d8b9cf796-600x400.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 812, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 823}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 481, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 492}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "228323", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Post"}, "id": "307948", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "id": "315017", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "id": "326957", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "id": "331120", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "id": "332491", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "id": "1271586", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 1012, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare"}], "time": "14:37:00"}

He decimated John Cena in 2014 when he made him look like a rag doll via German suplexes and became champion in one of the most lopsided victories in recent history.\n\nIf you see Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam this year, you might not see that. In fact, you might just see him leave.\n\nThat's because if Lesnar loses the Fatal Four Way main event and the Universal Championship, he will leave WWE. And some signs point to that actually happening instead of just being a story line bluff. Minutes after defeating Daniel Cormier at UFC 214, Jon Jones got a mic and turned his attention to Lesnar, who was last seen in the UFC in 2016.:\n\n\"Brock Lesnar, if you wanna know what it feels like to get your ass kicked by a guy who weighs 40 pounds less than you, meet me in the octagon.\"\n\nTwo days later, WWE capitalized on that hype. Paul Heyman went out to paint the champ as the ultimate underdog, one whose challenges may be so difficult that he doesn't actually overcome them. He blamed it on the odds of winning the Fatal Four Way title match. With Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman making up three quarters of the large adult wrestling sons match, defeating them seems like a lofty goal from the start.\n\nHeyman expanded a bit more and blamed the match's existence on who Kurt Angle answers to, implying that its less of a story motive and one commanded by WWE's real-life bosses. \"Why don't we just rename this SummerSlam 2017: Brock Loses the Universal Title. Because sir, respectfully, you've been told to make Brock Lesnar pay the ultimate price haven't you?\" If the nod to UFC wasn't enough Heyman spelled out what fighting fans wanted to hear. If Brock loses the Universal Title at SummerSlam, he leaves WWE.\n\nJust a week before, reports came out that Lesnar would not sign an extension with WWE, so this makes perfect sense. Would Lesnar leave WWE early to un-retire from the UFC? Not necessarily, although this is may be the best way to inject a sense of doubt in spite of Brock's victorious performances at SummerSlams past.\n\nTaking a look at his opponents, one would have to wonder if Lesnar could legitimately lose. The competition has never been more prepared to topple Brock.\n\nLesnar and Roman Reigns faced off in the main event of WrestleMania 31. Both competitors were spent as the match wound down, giving Seth Rollins his chance to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase and snatch the WWE Championship from Brock. Had the one-on-one match continued, Reigns could have beaten Lesnar -- that's not something many Lesnar opponents get to even entertain.\n\nMost recently, Samoa Joe got his chance at the Universal strap. Joe got the best of him with enough sleeper holds to make Lesnar look like the ripest tomato in the garden. But thanks to a quick escape via F5, Lesnar was able to scratch out the win. The moral victory that Joe got from having an entertaining match with Lesnar despite losing may have been worth more than the actual match's victory. Joe should have beaten Lesnar, but it was last gasp vs. last gasp, and Brock's won out.\n\nThen you have Braun Strowman, the comparative novice in the match, who removes a certain characteristic from most Lesnar matches -- the size advantage. Lesnar must look up at his opponent and cower (well, the Lesnar eqvivalent of cowering) at the sight of WWE's monster among men. Their singular confrontation was teased, however, during last Monday's edition of RAW. Surrounded by rows of security guards (and after Roman and Joe were taken out) Lesnar and Strowman had an intense staredown that escalated into a fight, much to the chagrin of the men with their tucked in black tees and then the entire WWE locker room.\n\nLooking back, you could see this as a pivotal moment within the super heavyweight portion of the WWE roster. Strowman winning at SummerSlam could be a changing of the guard, officially certifying him as WWE's top beast.\n\nUnlike most of his other SummerSlam appearances, Brock doesn't have to be pinned to lose in this multi-man match -- that's how he ended up dropping the title to Rollins back at Mania 31, as Seth pinned Roman instead of Lesnar. Brock Lesnar's beast incarnate persona would not suffer as a result, which would come in handy upon Lesnar's next quarterly set of appearances. With WWE on hold, he could take that time for a UFC fight.\n\nWith a wrestler as dominant as Brock Lesnar in the venue he's most dominant in, it's hard to convince fans he has a legitimate chance of losing. But thanks to his large competition, and the possibility of fighting in the octagon again, WWE has done just that.\n\nStill, it's feasible to see Lesnar win at SummerSlam and fight in the UFC: He did it just last year.

After moving the event from Staples Center in 2015 following a six-year run, the parties agreed to a two-year extension, which ends with the Aug. 20 event. The two sides said they share the same DNA when it comes to organizing shows of this magnitude.\n\n\"Our partners in New York have worked tirelessly to help create the incremental growth of SummerSlam week through the presentation of not only our ticketed and fan events at the Barclays Center, but also through the community-based events taking place in the city's five boroughs,\" said John Saboor, WWE's executive vice president of special events. \"We are very proud of that and the work that we have done.\"\n\nThe deal includes more than SummerSlam.\n\nWhat started as three straight nights of shows -- WWE's developmental brand NXT, SummerSlam and Raw -- is now four with Tuesday's SmackDown Live this year and 2018, according to Keith Sheldon, executive vice president for programming for Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment. During SummerSlam's six-year run at Staples Center, it only once hosted Raw the night following SummerSlam.\n\nFour days of a filled building, television exposure to millions and drawing people to Brooklyn from around the world are part of the value Barclays Center's leadership sees in SummerSlam.\n\n\"Having [WWE] here just does so much [for us],\" Sheldon said. \"These are destination events. These are not properties like a concert that is hitting the next city 100 miles away the next night. This is a one-off, mega-event.\"\n\nOne of the most important things to WWE in its partnership with Barclays Center has nothing to do with the SummerSlam show itself, but the company's commitment to helping coordinate community events around it.\n\nThose include WWE's Be a STAR bullying prevention rally at a Boys & Girls Club in The Bronx, a Special Olympics Unified Basketball Game and hospital visits, among others. It makes the weekend one that will draw fans from 49 states and 15 countries, according to Saboor.\n\n\"[It's] an opportunity to create a myriad of choices for our fans in the way of live events, fan events and community-based events, and creating a platform by which many of our fans can make this their annual family vacation,\" he said.\n\nNew York City's five boroughs -- and specifically Madison Square Garden -- have a special place in the history of WWE (formerly WWF) dating to famed champions Bruno Sammartino and Hulk Hogan. The Garden hosted the first WrestleMania and SummerSlam.\n\n\"It's just a wonderful relationship with MSG,\" he said. \"Our live-event staff is looking at every venue in the tri-state area as we place our major events, our major annual events, our television events, our non-television events. I know there is a constant dialogue with what is a wonderful leadership team at MSG.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Barclays Center is trying to carve its own piece of wrestling history and wants to continue to bring SummerSlam to Brooklyn.\n\n\"We are really proud of everything we accomplished at Barclays Center thus far,\" Sheldon said. \"Hosting SummerSlam for a third year in a row and bringing it back for a fourth year -- these are the big moments that are truly important to us.\"", "id": "9000952", "details": {"liCnt": 193}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "When WWE's SummerSlam is coming back to Brooklyn", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/wwe.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 786, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 793}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216987", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "218049", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "House show"}, "id": "306428", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_show"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "311830", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area", "label": {"eng": "New York metropolitan area"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "id": "315017", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE"}, {"label": {"eng": "Borough (New York City)"}, "id": "322577", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}, "id": "323684", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "id": "326957", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "id": "328739", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "id": "331120", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "id": "332491", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}, "id": "340558", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan"}, {"label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "id": "345417", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania"}, {"label": {"eng": "Staples Center"}, "id": "360365", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staples_Center"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bruno Sammartino"}, "id": "378754", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Sammartino"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports entertainment"}, "id": "390433", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_entertainment"}, {"label": {"eng": "WrestleMania I"}, "id": "858758", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_I"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE NXT (TV series)"}, "id": "1273130", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT_(TV_series)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 1089, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Clubs and Venues", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Clubs_and_Venues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Event Planning and Production", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Event_Planning_and_Production"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1154, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events"}], "time": "04:07:00"}

Although he hasn't been the most popular champion, Mahal is one of the most unlikely champions the company has ever seen and for him to get a shot at the company's biggest star before the company's second-biggest show of the year should make for some interesting television.\n\nAs for Cena, he might have to keep his eyes on not only The Singh Brothers at ringside, but Mr. Money in the Bank himself before SummerSlam.

Here's why he should win the main event.\n\nIn what is turning into one of the most interesting installments of WWE SummerSlam in years, this Sunday's main event is a battle of the monsters. Brock Lesnar will defend his Universal Championship in the main event against Samoa Joe, Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman.\n\nPaul Heyman has already been on the record saying that he and his client are walking should he not leave with the title this Sunday. With four men in the ring, Lesnar doesn't have to factor into the decision to lose his belt.\n\nThere is a very strong possibility that someone else could be leaving Brooklyn as the champion. After an impressive showing against Brock Lesnar at WWE Great Balls of Fire, Samoa Joe could very well end up winning the championship. Here's five reasons to make the case he should be champion.\n\nAt 38 years old, Samoa Joe is still on top of his game in the ring. His work in the ring is great just as it always has been and his matches thus far in the company have been highly talked about from NXT to the main roster.\n\nSince he's entered into the main event scene, Joe has brought the physicality and intensity to a scene that has absolutely needed it. The RAW brand's main event scene was suffering a bit with a part-time champion and it has seemingly elevated itself thanks to Joe.\n\nAs Universal Champion, Joe would be the standard bearer and certainly would create an example for all aspiring champions.

I grew up idiolising the WWE superstars, wanting to be the WWE Champion. It's a huge honour to be representing India, WWE and of course, my fans.\n\nHappy Independence Day India. Can't think of a better way to celebrate than beating John Cena\u00e2\u20ac| https://t.co/ayUbHnnSAZ- The Maharaja (@JinderMahal)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nQ: You beat Randy Orton yet again in the Punjabi Prison match and the involvement of The Great Khali was surprising. How did you manage to pull the rabbit out of the hat?\n\nA: See it's like you choose the Punjabi Prison match and since it was my turn, I chose it because there is no disqualification, no count out. (chuckles) So I used the rules to my advantage. I called The Great Khali to watch my back and he came to help me and I won. Great Khali is like my older brother, we have a very close relationship and we talk all the time. He's someone I get advice from and he was the World Heavyweight Champion and I admire him. He's someone I aspire to be like and I want to follow in his footsteps.\n\nQ: You fought the 16-time world champion John Cena in this week's SmackDown. How differently did you prepare for that match compared to a match against Orton?\n\nA: Yes I had the pleasure of taking John Cena last night (Tuesday) and it was definitely one of the biggest match of my career. I actually didn't have much time to prepare because they announced the match just a day before so I did everything to think about. Even Corbin tried to cash on in and everything unexpected was happening but I luckily I walked out still the WWE Champion and remain undefeated against John Cena. And yes I look forward to taking on John Cena again and ultimately beating him.\n\nPart II pic.twitter.com/Zg3TqOkWAP- The Maharaja (@JinderMahal)\n\nJune 16, 2017\n\nGet a glimpse of the #ModernDayMaharaja training for my match at #WWEMITB , for when I retain my WWE Championship against @RandyOrton@WWEpic.twitter.com/MXeVg3SUPC- The Maharaja (@JinderMahal)\n\nJune 15, 2017\n\nQ: What went through you when Baron Corbin cashed on his Money on the Bank contract and you had to fight instantly to retain your Championship?\n\nA: I was really worried. For a while I didn't know what was going on but when they announced that Corbin is cashing on his Money in the Bank, I did panic a bit because I didn't have the Singh Brothers on my side and I was worried that this was a very opportune time for Corbin while I was down. But fortunately for me I was able to hold on and since Corbin no longer holds that contract, it's a huge relief for me.\n\nTHIS. JUST. HAPPENED. #SDLive@BaronCorbinWWE@JinderMahalpic.twitter.com/S4PEy97NWv- WWE (@WWE)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nQ: How do you plan to promote WWE in India through your Championship?\n\nA: First of all, I want to be an inspiration to our youth and tell them that through hard work, everything is achievable. Secondly, I want to bring the WWE Championship to India. I know that WWE is working really hard to announce a date shortly and once it's finalised, I hope I can bring the WWE Championship to India and defend it on Indian soil.\n\nQ: So WWE is planning a match or an event in India?\n\nA: India is a very special part of the WWE Universe and so we really want to have an event there. WWE superstars were telling me about their experiences and how they can't wait to go back there. I really want to go to India and I know WWE is working really hard to announce a date and once the date is announced, I hope I am still the WWE Champion.\n\nThe celebration was on as #WWEChampion@JinderMahal and @SinghBrosWWE had a special surprise for India's Independence Day! #SDLivepic.twitter.com/I84uGe7avM- WWE (@WWE)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nQ: How do people look at Indian wrestlers in the WWE circuit?\n\nA: It's great. It's like we have wrestlers from all over the world. Like we have Shinsuke Nakamura from Japan, we have one from Bulgaria and Kevin Owens from Canada. WWE is truly a global entity, we travel all over the world, travel all these countries. It's very diverse and I hope in the future WWE India also grows and I would love to see more Indians get signed and ultimately make their way up to RAW and SmackDown.\n\nQ: You also sang the Indian national anthem on Independence Day in America. How was that feeling?\n\nA: It was a very proud feeling, the lady singer did a wonderful job. And we you know we had my kind of celebration with bhangra dancers and for me, it was great.\n\nQ: SummerSlam is just round the corner. How are you preparing for your WWE Championship fight with Shinsuke Nakamura? What is going to be your strategy against him?\n\nA: My strategy is just to weather the storm. I know he's very strong and he's going to come with his strikes. He was very lethal precision with his strikes but there's a reason I am the WWE Champion, my toughness and I can weather his storm. I will take his weakness when I find it and I also have the Singh brothers with me, they are my spirit that I walk out of the SummerSlam as the WWE Champion.\n\nQ: There are reports of WWE wanting to expand their fanbase in Japan as well which gives Nakamura an equal shot at the title. Your thoughts?\n\nA: Like I said earlier WWE is a global phenomenon and they want to expand all over the world. It's not so much about the country but the performer. I started my career with WWE in 2011 and they didn't just give me the WWE Championship and even the chance to contest for it. It is just now that I have worked hard to reach this level. I have proven to WWE and the WWE universe that I am worth of the Championship, that's when it happened. So it's going to be me I am good or if Nakamura is worthy, he'll win. It's not about the country we are from.\n\nQ: What is the inspiration behind your finishing move 'Khallas'?\n\nA: The inspiration is actually my uncle Gama Singh, who is the former professional wrestler and used to play during the 1980s. His signature was the camel clutch with submission so I originally used the camel clutch hold but then I added my variation when I picked the guy up and slammed him down. So it's a thing from my uncle but with my twist to it.", "id": "9621827", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "I hope to defend my WWE Championship on Indian soil: Jinder Mahal to India Today", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/jinder-story_647_081717090702.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 256, "freq": 2, "date": "-05-21", "amb": false, "textEnd": 262}, {"textStart": 796, "date": "-06-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 803}, {"textStart": 1565, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1580}, {"textStart": 2014, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2029}, {"textStart": 3459, "date": "2017-06-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3472}, {"textStart": 3668, "date": "2017-06-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3681}, {"textStart": 4340, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4355}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "113", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "id": "304688", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "id": "315017", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "id": "331294", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "id": "332491", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "id": "332493", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "id": "340566", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "id": "340568", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena"}, {"label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}, "id": "378642", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "id": "426499", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shane McMahon"}, "id": "520143", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_McMahon"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Great Khali"}, "id": "564363", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Khali"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kevin Owens"}, "id": "1271658", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Owens"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 1184, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional"}], "time": "06:12:00"}

The build towards the pay-per-view has been a disappointing one, though there's plenty of hype surrounding the main event.\n\nBrock Lesnar will defend his WWE Universal Championship in what's sure to be the night's final match, and the Intercontinental Championship is the only belt that isn't scheduled to be on the line in Brooklyn. Below are predictions for every match on the SummerSlam card, which features wrestlers from both \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"SmackDown Live.\"\n\nWWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman (Fatal 4-Way Match)\n\nBrock Lesnar, pictured before his fight with Mark Hunt at UFC 200 at T-Mobile Arena on July 9, 2016 in Las Vegas, will probably win the WWE Universal Championship Match at SummerSlam 2017. Photo: Getty Images\n\nWrestleMania is WWE's No.1 show each year, but this is undoubtedly the biggest match of 2017, thus far. It combines WWE's top feud (Strowman vs. Reigns) with the best main-event match of the past eight months (Lesnar vs. Joe). Reigns will win a world title soon enough, but that might won't come until WrestleMania 34 after he inevitably wins the Royal Rumble. WWE might not be ready to put the strap on Strowman just yet, though Joe has an outside chance of winning with the way he's performed in recent weeks. Paul Heyman's announcement that Lesnar will leave WWE with a loss probably means he'll retain since the former UFC Champion is reportedly signed with the company for at least another seven and a half months.\n\nPrediction: Brock Lesnar\n\nWWE Champion Jinder Mahal vs. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nNow that Baron Corbin's Money in the Bank briefcase is no longer in play, it's clear that Jinder or Nakamura will walk away from SummerSlam with the WWE Championship. Despite beating Randy Orton in three championship matches, Jinder still hasn't won clean on a PPV. WWE clearly believes in Nakamura, having kept him undefeated on the main roster. His clean win over Cena last week likely means that WWE is ready to put the belt on the Japanese superstar, possibly planning to keep it on him for a while.\n\nPrediction: Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nTHIS. JUST. HAPPENED. #SDLive @BaronCorbinWWE @JinderMahal pic.twitter.com/S4PEy97NWv\n\n&mdash; WWE (@WWE) August 16, 2017\n\n\u200b\n\nCorbin's failed cash-in attempt means one of two things -- WWE did it to enhance his character as a heel, or the company has given up on him becoming a top heel for the time being. His loss to Jinder Tuesday night probably gives him a better chance of beating Cena, but a loss at SummerSlam wouldn't bode well for Corbin's immediate future on \"SmackDown Live.\"\n\nPrediction: Baron Corbin\n\nSmackDown Women's Champion Naomi vs. Natalya\n\nWWE seems committed to keeping Naomi as the SmackDown Women's Champion, and there are even rumors that she could hold the belt until 2018. She gets a strong reaction from the live crowd each week, and Carmella is a bigger threat to her title reign than Natalya because of her Money in the Bank briefcase.\n\nPrediction: Namoi\n\nUnited States Champion AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens (Shane McMahon as special guest referee)\n\nThis is NOT what @FightOwensFight was hoping for...was it? #SDLive @AJStylesOrg @shanemcmahon pic.twitter.com/tv4FrZI4Tf\n\n&mdash; WWE (@WWE) August 16, 2017\n\nStyles might be the biggest lock on the entire card. It's clear that WWE is setting up a future match between Owens and Shane, and there won't be much reason for them to fight if Shane is the ref that helps Owens regain his title. Shane won't purposely screw Owens, but he'll probably be involved in the result in some capacity, more so than just counting to three when Styles gets the pinfall.\n\nPrediction: AJ Styles\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions Sheamus & Cesaro vs. Seth Rollins & Dean Ambrose\n\n.@TheDeanAmbrose and @WWERollins were finally on the same page last night on #RAW! pic.twitter.com/DvyX4FZfIu\n\n&mdash; WWE (@WWE) August 15, 2017\n\nThe reunion between Rollins and Ambrose is one of the few storylines that WWE has handled perfectly in recent months. The former Shield members drew the biggest pop of the night when they finally agreed to team up on \"Monday Night Raw,\" and they're going to win the belts sooner or later. It's possible that Sheamus and Cesaro will use heel tactics to win, drawing out Rollins and Ambrose's title chase a little bit longer, but no one will complain if they win at Barclays Center.\n\nPrediction: Seth Rollins & Dean Ambrose\n\nSmackDown Tag Team Champions The New Day vs. The Usos\n\nThe Usos' win over Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston Tuesday night probably means that The New Day is coming out on top Sunday night. These two teams had the best match at Battleground, and they could steal the show again in their rematch.\n\nPrediction: The New Day\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nA win for Orton wouldn't make much sense. He's clearly going to be out of the WWE Championship picture for a while, following his program with Jinder. Rusev has what it takes to be a main-event heel, but it can't happen if he doesn't start beating guys like Orton on PPV.\n\nPrediction: Rusev\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass (with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a Shark Cage)\n\nWWE seems to have big plans for Cass, and it starts with a win at SummerSlam. It's a situation similar to that of Orton vs. Rusev, and Big Show is at the point in his career where he doesn't need to win at big events.\n\n\"The Demon\" Finn B\u00e1lor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nThe point of Wyatt beating Balor in a singles match on \"Monday Night Raw\" was so that the first WWE Universal Champion could come back and win as \"The Demon\" at SummerSlam. WWE has done their best to build up Wyatt with wins over Orton, Rollins and Balor in recent months, but history shows that the company has no problem with him losing at the year's biggest PPVs.\n\nPrediction: Finn B\u00e1lor\n\nRaw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks\n\nThis match could go either way since it was Bayley who was originally supposed to face Bliss at SummerSlam. Bayley was likely going to become the new champion, so does that mean the same will happen with her replacement? Considering the late change to the match and the fact that Bliss has been the best female performer on the WWE roster in 2017, she's the safe bet to leave SummerSlam as the Raw Women's Champion.\n\nPrediction: Alexa Bliss\n\nWWE Cruiserweight Champion Akira Tozawa vs. Neville\n\nMost of WWE's big PPV's have at least one surprising result, and the Cruiserweight Championship Match might fall into that category. Tozawa's title win Monday night popped the crowd, but Neville is easily the best part of the division. Look for him to take back his belt and end Tozawa's title run after just six days, giving him even more heat as one of WWE's best heels.\n\nPrediction: Neville", "id": "9521035", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "WWE SummerSlam 2017: Predictions, Match Card For Biggest PPV Since WrestleMania ", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/08/16/gettyimages-547105820_2.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 769, "date": "2016-07-09", "amb": false, "textEnd": 781}, {"textStart": 2358, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2373}, {"textStart": 4010, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4025}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

Jinder Mahal is expected to lose his WWE Championship to Shinsuke Nakamura, relinquishing his spot as the top champion on \"SmackDown Live.\"\n\nThere are a few reasons to believe Nakamura will win, among them being the latest betting odds. The challenger is a 4/11 favorite just five days before the match, via Paddy Power, and Jinder is a 15/8 underdog.\n\nEver since he debuted on \"SmackDown Live\" following WrestleMania 33, Nakamura has been booked stronger than anyone on the blue brand. He's yet to get pinned as a member of the main roster, and he even defeated John Cena clean to earn his WWE Championship opportunity at SummerSlam. Nakamura did lose consecutive NXT Championship matches to Bobby Roode prior to WrestleMania 33.\n\nJinder Mahal has been the WWE Champion since Backlash on May 21. He defeated Randy Orton for the title and has since successfully defended the belt twice against The Viper.\n\nJinder's title reign came largely out of nowhere. He had never held a belt in WWE and was largely viewed as a jobber before he earned his title shot shortly after WrestleMania 33. Having needed help from The Singh Brothers and The Great Khali to beat Orton in all three championship matches, it's easy to envision him getting pinned by Nakamura in Brooklyn.\n\nWWE Championship Belt presented during the Beyond Sport United 2016 at Barclays Center on August 9, 2016 in Brooklyn, New York, less than two weeks before SummerSlam.

Baron Corbin holds the Money in the Bank Briefcase, and he's had a feud of his own with Nakamura for the past few months. Corbin was disqualified for using a low blow against Nakamura at Battleground, and he attacked the No.1 contender for the WWE Championship after his recent victory over Cena.\n\nCorbin will face Cena in a singles match at SummerSlam. If The Lone Wolf loses to the 16-time world champion, it might be a sign that he's going to cash in his Money in the Bank contract later on in the night.\n\nWhile it might be surprising to see Jinder still holding the WWE Championship at the conclusion of SummerSlam, there isn't the same level of certainty that the pay-per-view will produce a new WWE Universal Champion. Even though Brock Lesnar will put his belt on the line against three other wrestlers, he's the odds-on favorite to win the fatal 4-way title match.\n\nThe WWE Universal Championship Match will almost certainly be the main event of the PPV. Samoa Joe is considered to be the second favorite in the match, and he has an outside chance to pull off the upset. Roman Reigns isn't expected to get the pinfall, nor is Braun Strowman.\n\nPaul Heyman has said that Lesnar will leave WWE if he loses his title. If Lesnar doesn't end up winning the match, don't expect him to be the one that gets pinned or submitted.\n\nIt's been three years since the WWE Championship changed hands at SummerSlam. Lesnar defeated Cena for the belt in 2014, and Daniel Bryan won the WWE Championship from Cena in the previous year.", "id": "9309029", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "WWE SummerSlam

He'll have to settle for the consolation prize of getting to go toe-to-toe with him on the go-home edition of SmackDown.\n\nThe Dunkin Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, will also host the United States champ issuing an apology, another dive into the world of Fashion Files and perhaps a change in Lana's role for the blue brand.\n\nSummerSlam will be the focus all night as Superstars prepare for their big PPV clashes and animosity between rivals gets escalated just in time for the event. It's time to get last bit of hype generated and make any last-minute changes to the card.\n\nWhat's in store for the final SmackDown before the summer blockbuster?\n\nBackstage news, storyline analysis and the SmackDown preview on WWE.com help answer that. Read on for a full preview of the show before it airs on Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET on USA Network.\n\nIt's worth keeping an eye on how the WWE books Shinsuke Nakamura.\n\nEn route to defeating Cena to become the No. 1 contender to the WWE Championship, the former NXT titleholder dropped his opponent on his head. Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated reported that the slip-up left WWE headman Vince McMahon \"furious\" with Nakamura.\n\nMcMahon apparently hasn't lost faith in the star, but Nakamura reportedly has a short leash of shorts. \"If Nakamura makes another mistake on a grand stage, Sports Illustrated learned through channels close to WWE, then McMahon will have an entirely different opinion of Nakamura,\" Barrasso wrote.\n\nNakamura's old rival may be due for a shift in gimmick. According to Bryan Alvarez on Wrestling Observer Live (h/t Cageside Seats' Randall Ortman), the WWE could soon repackage Dolph Ziggler.\n\nThat would explain why The Showoff hasn't appeared on TV for weeks.\n\nAnd Charlotte Flair will have something bigger than wrestling on her mind on Tuesday, as her father Ric Flair is dealing with serious health issues. The Nature Boy underwent surgery and is now recovering. TMZ reported: \"We're told Ric's family is by his side and they're waiting to meet with doctors.\"\n\nIt won't be surprising in the least in that case if Charlotte doesn't work SmackDown and chooses instead to be with her dad.\n\nUnited States champ AJ Styles has been on a tear. The Phenomenal One has now won five non-tag matches on SmackDown in a row, per CageMatch.net. And he's 7-3 in the last 10 TV and PPV matches overall.\n\nThe WWE is thankfully keeping Styles in a high-profile spot and continuing to position him as one of SmackDown's toughest outs.\n\nLana is getting the opposite treatment. The Ravishing Russian is clearly at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to the blue brand's women's division.\n\nAfter falling to Flair last week, she is now 0-6 in 2017 and 0-7 for her entire career, per CageMatch.net.\n\nStyles accidentally clocked Shane McMahon as the SmackDown commissioner talked about the upcoming U.S. title bout. After taking a boot to the head, McMahon had to have flashbacks to his feud with Styles earlier this year.\n\nTo get back on the good side of the man set to referee his U.S. title match at SummerSlam against Kevin Owens, the champ is set to apologize to McMahon on Tuesday night, per the SmackDown preview on WWE.com.\n\nThere will be no apologies involved when Natalya takes on Becky Lynch.\n\nNatalya will be out to gain momentum ahead of her SmackDown Women's Championship match against Naomi at SummerSlam. Lynch, who looks to be left out of the PPV picture, will have to settle for being the No. 1 contender's warm-up opponent.\n\nAnd we may find out whether Breezango will be up to anything at SummerSlam.\n\nTyler Breeze and Fandango have been so entertaining as SmackDown's resident comedians that it was easy to not realize they aren't on the SummerSlam card yet. The SmackDown preview, however, did promise another Twin Peaks-inspired edition of Fashion Files.\n\nIf Breezango gets closer to answering the mystery of who trashed their office, they may have a SummerSlam fight on their hands.\n\nMahal and Cena don't have that kind of uncertainty. Each is already lined up for a big bout at the event. Mahal is set to defend his WWE title against Nakamura; Cena will face Baron Corbin.\n\nBefore those collisions, SmackDown will host a match many thought would be at SummerSlam itself -- Cena vs. Mahal in non-title action.\n\nCorbin is sure to be lurking. He not only has reason to ambush or embarrass Cena, he has the Money in the Bank contract in-hand and will be watching for Mahal to grow vulnerable enough to create the ideal cash-in opportunity.\n\nRaw already had its last chance to sell fans on its SummerSlam matches.

Lesnar, who has again been teasing a return to UFC, has threatened to leave WWE if he loses this match because he is unhappy at having to defend his title against three opponents. Can the master of the F5 retain his prized title?\n\nWhat about the women's titles?\n\nBoth Raw and SmackDown's women's championships will be determined in singles bouts.

The biggest Superstars in the WWE go to battle on Aug. 20. I'm a bit of a 'pro-wrestling pro,' so find out who I predict will win at this brawlin' bash!\n\nFor the third year in a row, the biggest Superstars in the world will head to Brooklyn for the hottest night in the WWE. SummerSlam takes place on Aug. 20 from the Barclays Center, featuring both Raw and SmackDown branded Superstars. Practically every single championship will be defended, meaning that the night could be full of shocking wins and crushing defeats. Let's see if my extensive pro-wrestling geekery pays off, as I think the following Superstars will take home a win.\n\nAkira Tozawa (c) (with Titus O'Neil) vs. Neville for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship\n\nThis is technically a rematch, as the championship bout between Akira Tozawa, 32, and \"The King of the Cruiserweights\" Neville, 30, was pushed up to the Aug. 14 episode of RAW. Tozawa managed to end Neville's 197-day reign with a top rope senton. I think it would be surprising to see him lose it less than a week after winning, so I'm picking Akira to retain. Maybe Neville gets disqualified after unleashing his rage from losing?\n\nPrediction: Akira Tozawa.\n\nThe New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) (c) (with Kofi Kingston) vs. The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso) for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship\n\nThe New Day defeated the Usos for the SmackDown tag team titles at Battleground, leading Jey, 31, and Jimmy, 31, to jump the new champs at the subsequent SmackDown. The New Day responded by showing a rougher edge, attacking the Usos with chairs. Considering that this show is supposedly on the pre-show, I don't think either side scores a win. The New Day walks out of SummerSlam with the titles, but expect this feud to last until Hell In A Cell in October.\n\nPrediction: The New Day retain.\n\nCesaro and Sheamus (c) vs. Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins for the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship\n\nAJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens for the WWE United States Championship (with Shane McMahon as special guest referee)\n\nKevin Owens, 33, and AJ Styles, 40, have been feuding over the United States championship, with referee shenanigans preventing them from determining a clear winner. Shane McMahon, 47, aka \"the guy AJ Styles beat at WrestleMania\" is the special guest ref. I don't think Shane will screw AJ out of the win, and \"The Phenomenal One\" leaves the Barclays Center with the belt.\n\nSo, in another case of \"why wait until SummerSlam,\" Finn Balor, 36, and Bray Wyatt, 30, fought on the Aug. 14 edition of RAW, with Bray securing the win. He then dumped a bucket of \"viscous, acidic red fluid\" on Finn, freaking the Irishman out. Finn has promised to unleash \"The Demon\" on Bray in this rematch and I think that will be enough to give Finn the win.\n\nBoth these Superstars are coming off of losses at Battleground. Rusev, 31, lost to John Cena, 40, in a Flag Match while Randy Orton, 37, failed to beat Jinder Mahal, 31, to win the WWE Championship. There's no real motivation behind this match, which might be a greater statement on both of these guys' careers. If I were in charge, I'd see Rusev take the loss and uses it as a way to reinvent himself. Perhaps he can resurrect \"Handsome\" Rusev? So, I'm going with that.\n\nPrediction: RKO out of nowhere. Randy wins. Yawn.\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass (with Enzo Amore will be suspended above the ring in a shark cage)\n\nSo, Baron Corbin, 32, wins Money In The Bank, allowing him to have a WWE championship match \"anytime, anywhere.\" He attempts to cash it in after Cena fought Jinder on the Aug. 16 episode of SmackDown, only to lose after John distracted Baron, allowing Jinder to roll \"The Lone Wolf\" up. With rumors that the WWE front office has lost faith in Baron, according to Wrestling News, and John expected to bounce between SmackDown and Raw as a \"free agent,\" my pick is clear.\n\nPrediction: John Cena.\n\nAlexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks for the WWE Raw Women's Championship\n\nThis match was originally supposed to be Alexa Bliss, 26, against Bayley, 28, but \"The Huggable One\" got sidelined with a shoulder injury. Sasha Banks, 25, won a shot at the title by defeating Nia Jax, 33. Honestly, I can see Alexa getting through this match and holding onto the belt until Bayley gets back. Though, there's this nagging feeling that \"The Empress Of Tomorrow\" Asuka, 35, will make her debut either at SummerSlam or the subsequent RAW (assuming she loses to Ember Moon, 28, at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III). Eh. I'm going with \"The Boss\" on this one.\n\nPrediction: Sasha becomes a 4-time Raw Women's Champ.\n\nNaomi (c) vs. Natalya for the WWE SmackDown Women's Championship\n\nJinder Mahal (c) (with The Singh Brothers) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the WWE Championship\n\nIs it time to hinder Jinder? Having gotten recently thrashed by Randy Orton and John Cena, it seems \"The Modern Day Maharaja\" is running out of steam and will lose his belt to Shinsuke Nakamura, 37. Something else to keep in mind: Shinsuke and AJ Styles locked eyes during the titular Money In The Bank Match, causing fans to freak. These two had a massive rivalry overseas in New Japan Pro Wrestling. With both Superstars getting up in the years, the WWE doesn't have much time to capitalize on having two of the most charismatic wrestlers on their payroll.\n\nHowever, I don't think they'll rush to the match, especially since SmackDown's next event is Hell In The Cell. I think Jinder (aka \"the New American Dream\") feuds for the US Title with AJ Styles, while Kevin or Baron keeps Shinsuke occupied until Survivor Series. Then, the WWE will see \"The King Of Strong Style\" versus \"The Phenomenal One.\"\n\nPrediction: and your NEW WWE Champion, Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nBrock Lesnar (c) (with Paul Heyman) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman in a Fatal 4-Way match for the WWE Universal Championship\n\nIn a case of mixing reality into pro-wrestling, Brock Lesnar, 38, (though his advocate, Paul Heyman, 51) has hinted that he would leave the WWE due to unfair treatment if he were to lose his Universal Championship in the Fatal 4-way with Braun Strowman, 33, Samoa Joe, 38, and Roman Reigns. There's talk of Brock returning to UFC to face Jon Jones, 30, in a super fight, but fans can't overlook the reality that Brock still needs to serve the rest of his suspension for a USDA violation. He has more than six months remaining on his suspension and Brock hadn't re-entered the USADA testing pool by July, according to MMAJunkie. He wouldn't be eligible to fight in the UFC until 2018. So, with that, it might seem that Brock beats the odds and keeps the belt.\n\nThe thing is, Brock is a part-timer who has only wrestled about four televised matches in 2017, so it's likely he was going to \"leave\" anyway. Personally, I'm not a fan of Brock holding onto the belt. He's too much of a beast (pun intended) that he doesn't need the belt to draw attention. Keeping the title off of the WWE screen lessens the belt's importance and hurts the show.\n\nWith all that said, picking a winner in this is tough. Joe came very close to beating Brock at Great Balls Of Fire. Reigns could believably beat Brock, having just sent The Undertaker, 52, into retirement at WrestleMania. Braun is a \"Monster Among Men\" who beat Roman in an Ambulance match. While I'd love to see Joe choke Brock out, something tells me that it's Braun who ends SummerSlam at the champ.\n\nPrediction: Braun Strowman is YOUR new WWE Universal Champion.\n\nWhat do you think about these predictions, HollywoodLifers? Do you agree? Disagree?

But with the main events now announced and a couple matches still rumored, it's time to take a look at the card as we await final official word.\n\nIt is all set to go down live from Brooklyn beginning at 7 p.m. ET on Sunday, August 20. The kickoff show will start an hour earlier at 6 p.m. ET and all action can be watched live nationally on WWE Network.\n\nBig fan of WWE? Be sure to subscribe to our podcast In This Corner with Brian Campbell where we break down everything you need to know each week.\n\n2017 WWE SummerSlam matches\n\nUniversal Championship -- Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman (Fatal 4-Way): There will be more than 1,200 pounds of mass in this match, which should be the main event of the card. Paul Heyman added a stipulation that Lesnar will leave WWE if he loses the title due to a Fatal 4-Way being unfair to the champion.\n\nWWE Championship -- Jinder Mahal (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura: It was long expected that Cena would be the one to fight and defeat Mahal, but Nakamura beat Cena clean to become the No. 1 contender for the WWE title. There has been no build otherwise for this match.\n\nUnited States Championship -- AJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens: The fourth time they will meet with the title on the line in a televised match, Styles and Owens will do so this time with SmackDown commissioner Shane McMahon serving as the special guest referee. This one should finally result in a ... somewhat-decisive finish.\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt: This feud finally came to a head Monday on Raw when Wyatt beat Balor clean and appeared to dump blood on him after the match. Backstage, Balor teased the return of the Demon King at SummerSlam.\n\nRaw Women's Championship -- Alexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks: Though Baley earned the No. 1 contendership, a shoulder injury has forced her from SummerSlam. Banks beat Nia Jax in a No. 1 contendership match on Monday.\n\nSmackDown Women's Championship -- Naomi (c) vs. Natalya: Earning her shot by winning a Fatal 5-Way match at Battleground, Natalya will look to win her first \"women's\" championship after previously being divas champion for two months. This match will likely take place on the kickoff show.\n\nRaw Tag Team Championship -- Sheamus & Cesaro (c) vs. Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins: Moments after Ambrose and Rollins reunited, general manager Kurt Angle locked in a tag team championship match for SummerSlam.\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin: Corbin attacked Nakamura and Cena came to the aid of the King of Strong Style on SmackDown by putting Corbin through the announce table. Daniel Bryan made the match official on Tuesday.\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev: Not exactly sure who came up with this one.\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass: Enzo Amore will be suspended above the ring in a shark cage. This should be on the kickoff show, one would hope.\n\nSmackDown Tag Team Championship -- The New Day (c) vs. The Usos (Kickoff Show): New Day won the titles at Battleground, so a rematch makes plenty of sense. There are no other tag teams on the show really deserving of the spotlight anyway.\n\nCruiserweight Championship -- Akira Tozawa (c) vs. Neville (Kickoff Show): After Tozawa surprisingly beat Neville clean for the title on Raw, the former champion gets his rematch at SummerSlam.", "id": "9608367", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "WWE SummerSlam 2017 matches, card, start time, date, rumors, kickoff show", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/07/11/5d0d353a-98a9-4a57-a43e-4a19edbbdaab/thumbnail/770x433/b6ed28fd0ccad7d0ebb4322b9118289e/reigns-angle-lesnar-raw.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 457, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 466}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "id": "313955", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

Barclays Center deleted a tweet that announced Lesnar would be on \"Monday Night Raw\" 24 hours after SummerSlam, according to Cageside Seats, potentially spoiling the result of the pay-per-view's main event.\n\nPaul Heyman has repeated on multiple occasions that Lesnar will leave WWE if his client loses the WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam. Lesnar will defend his belt against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe in a fatal 4-way match.\n\nOf course, Lesnar could lose his title and WWE could create a reason within the storyline why the former UFC Champion might show back up on TV. The more likely answer, however, is that Lesnar will remain the champion after Sunday night. He's the favorite to do so, having won the belt from Goldberg at WrestleMania 33 and successfully defended it against Joe at Great Balls of Fire.\n\nFor Cena, appearing on \"Monday Night Raw\" was the norm for many years. But the 16-time world champion has exclusively been a \"SmackDown Live\" performer since last year's brand split.\n\nJohn Cena, pictured before his match against Seth Rollins at WWE SummerSlam 2015 at Barclays Center of Brooklyn on Aug. 23, 2015 in New York City, could be on the same episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" as Brock Lesnar before the end of the summer. Photo: Getty Images\n\nCena wasn't moved during April's Superstar Shake-up, but WWE has made it clear that he will be showing up on \"Monday Night Raw\" at some point in the near future. Cena took a break from in-ring action for three months after beating The Miz at WrestleMania 33, and WWE described him as a \"free agent\" when he returned to WWE on July 4.\n\n\"The reason that I wanted to be a free agent and the reason they kind of granted my request is because I don't know if I'll be available for Smackdown specific only or Raw specific only, and I also know that my days are numbered,\" Cena told Complex last month. \"I just turned 40 in April and we have so many young and talented performers, I don't know how many years I have left. So in the time I have left, I'm gonna do what I can to dedicate to this company I just want to be able to do it the most time that I possibly can.\"\n\nCena will have a match against Baron Corbin at SummerSlam, and his free-agent status will allow him to face members of the \"Monday Night Raw\" roster at future PPV's. Don't be surprised if he challenges for the WWE Universal Championship at some point before the end of 2017.\n\nThe ability to appear on \"Monday Night Raw\" might ultimately lead to a clash between Cena and Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 34. That match would almost certainly be the main event of the April 8 PPV in New Orleans.", "id": "9554922", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "John Cena, Brock Lesnar Returning To 'Monday Night Raw' After SummerSlam 2017?", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/08/16/gettyimages-485063304_1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 411, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb": false, "textEnd": 418}, {"textStart": 1555, "date": "2015-08-23", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1568}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 2031, "date": "2017-07-04", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2037}, {"textStart": 3031, "date": "-04-08", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3038}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "218049", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "id": "315017", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "id": "315019", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kayfabe"}, "id": "323448", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "id": "326957", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "id": "331120", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE brand extension"}, "id": "332484", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Brand_Extension"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "id": "332491", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "id": "332492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "id": "340568", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}, "id": "340569", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "id": "340572", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar"}, {"label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "id": "345417", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "id": "349082", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bill Goldberg"}, "id": "361715", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Goldberg"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}, "id": "374391", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Miz"}, "id": "434925", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miz"}, {"label": {"eng": "FedExForum"}, "id": "607539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedExForum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "id": "1272200", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "id": "1274824", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 360, "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1089, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Clubs and Venues", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Clubs_and_Venues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1230, "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Vegetarianism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Vegetarianism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1318, "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Fibers", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Fibers"}], "time": "19:56:00"}

In the last week, a few tweets may have spoiled the PPV main event and a huge surprise for Monday.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, the official Twitter account of the Barclays Center took to promoting their huge WWE events coming up on Sunday and Monday. As reported by PW Mania, one of their tweets was for Monday Night Raw on August 21, and it revealed that Brock Lesnar will be there in person.\n\nUnfortunately for those that saw it, there was another bit of information in the tweet that was quickly deleted, but many still caught what it said.\n\n\"JUST ANNOUNCED: Universal Champion \"The Beast\" @BrockLesnar will be live on @WWE #RAW this Monday, 8/21! pic.twitter.com/FUAr7G2Bi7\n\n-- Barclays Center (@barclayscenter) August 16, 2017''\n\nAs you can see, it is saying that Brock Lesnar will be the Universal Champion on Monday night which means he would be the one winning in the main event of SummerSlam.\n\nMany said that they just said this because he is the current WWE Universal Champion, but it doesn't mean that SummerSlam was spoiled. Others pointed out the storyline where Paul Heyman said his client would leave WWE if he lost the Universal Title this Sunday at the PPV.\n\nIf Brock Lesnar is scheduled to be on Monday Night Raw, that seems to mean he will still be the champion by that time.\n\nThis tweet was deleted, but the Barclays Center Twitter account posted another spoiler-filled announcement last week. Everyone knows that John Cena is currently listed as a \"free agent\" and set to face Baron Corbin at SummerSlam, but Pop Culture caught a tweet that may have spoiled his return date to Raw.\n\nWith his free agent status, he can jump brands as he sees fit, but it appears he's headed for Monday nights very soon. It's just interesting that the Barclays Center left this tweet up but deleted the one about Lesnar.\n\nNo matter what ends up happening, WWE has the ability to change things up at the last minute and alter these spoilers if they're actually true. SummerSlam still has to take place on Sunday night before Monday Night Raw can begin, and that's a lot of decision making that needs to be done.

Traditionally the second biggest event of the year for WWE, the show's past is full of memorable matches and moments.\n\nSummerSlam was launched in 1988. Of the traditional \"Big Four\" shows for WWE, SummerSlam was the final one conceived. WrestleMania was the first, in 1985. Survivor Series was launched in 1987 to try to end NWA's stranglehold on the wrestling market over Thanksgiving (and to try to force it off of PPV). The Royal Rumble, also coming in 1988, was first aired on free television (USA Network) to counter the NWA's Bunkhouse Stampede PPV show. So even though SummerSlam was the fourth of these shows created, it was actually the third to air on PPV.\n\nThe early SummerSlam shows usually focused on big tag team matches in the main event. In fact, the 1988, 1989, and 1991 shows were all headlined by tag team bouts (1990 had Ultimate Warrior taking on Rick Rude).\n\nThe 2017 edition will be the 30th edition of SummerSlam. So when we look tat the previous 29 editions, narrowing the shows down to a top five is a difficult task. Never to shy away from a challenge, that is what we have attempted to do here.\n\nWithout further delay, here are the top five SummerSlam shows, from top to bottom, in WWE history. Get ready to fire up the WWE Network and relive some of these classics.\n\nPreviousSlide 1/5Next 5. SummerSlam 2000\n\n2000 was a transitional year for WWE. Steve Austin missed most of the year due to neck surgery. There was the arrival of the Radicalz from WCW. Chris Jericho was still fresh from his 1999 arrival. Triple H and The Rock were coming into their own as the full time main eventers, carrying the ship until Austin would return, though \"Stone Cold\" would never regain his level of majesty that he had prior to 2000.\n\nSummerSlam 2000 was an awesome card featuring perhaps the greatest match in SummerSlam history: the iconic TLC Ladder Match between Edge and Christian, The Hardy Boyz, and The Dudley Boyz. In an era of great tag team wrestling, this was quite possibly the ultimate tag team performance.\n\nElsewhere on the card, Chris Benoit wrestled Chris Jericho in a very good match and The Rock, Triple H, and Kurt Angle had a standout main event match for the WWE title.\n\nThis was the WWE in the twilight years of the Attitude Era. A change was on the horizon.\n\nPreviousSlide 2/5Next 4. SummerSlam 2014\n\nEven if the storylines in recent years have left something to be desired at many points, the wrestling has been off the charts for some time now. We've been enjoying the most stacked roster in WWE history for the last five years or so, and the 2014 edition of SummerSlam certainly demonstrates that fact.\n\nBrock Lesnar defeated John Cena for the WWE title in a tremendous main event. While the term \"Suplex City\" had yet to be born, Brock hit John with 16 German suplexes in this match. At this point, it was fresh and not a tired gimmick that Brock brings out in every match. In his entire run as a main eventer, John Cena had never taken a beating like he did in this bout. It was something so unique, so memorable, like nothing we had never seen before.\n\nThe main event was preceded by Roman Reigns taking on Randy Orton in another four star match. This was also the summer that The Shield split, and we also witnessed Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose in a really good brawl earlier on the show.\n\nPreviousSlide 3/5Next 3. SummerSlam 2013\n\nSeveral of the recent editions of SummerSlam have been more than stellar. The 2015 and 2016 editions of the show also nearly cracked this list. Were in the midst of a four or five year run like we've never seen before as far as great SummerSlams go. However, the 2013 summer classic had two bouts that were legitimate match of the year contenders.\n\nBrock Lesnar vs. CM Punk was a dream match of that time period. It could have headlined WrestleMania. Instead, this SummerSlam drew a less than stellar PPV buy rate (the last SummerSlam to air exclusively on PPV prior to the WWE Network), and rumor has it that Vince pinned much of that blame on Punk. It's perhaps why he wasn't slated to headline WrestleMania XXX the following spring, which of course resulted in Punk walking out of the company in frustration after the Royal Rumble in January 2014.\n\nNone of that should take away from what, in the end, was an excellent match. Punk got one of Brock's best matches out of him since his return to pro wrestling in 2012. It's better than the 2014 bout against John Cena, too.\n\nLater in the show, we were treated to Daniel Bryan taking on John Cena. If only we knew at the time that we had less than a year left of enjoying Bryan's work. The match itself saw Bryan defeat John for the WWE championship, but the joy didn't last very long. Out came Randy Orton, who immediately cashed in his Money In The Bank contract and defeated Bryan for the belt.\n\nPreviousSlide 4/5Next 2. SummerSlam 1998\n\nYou could make the argument that no show in WWE history has ever been built up as successfully as SummerSlam 1998.\n\nThe Steve Austin vs. Undertaker storyline that was the focal point for WWE throughout that summer produced the memorable \"Highway To Hell\" promos (see above) that will probably never be topped as WWE promotional material.\n\nWWE was riding at one of their highest points ever at this point. There were MTV specials focusing on pro wrestling, post shows on the Home Shopping Network, and you couldn't go to a local mall without seeing an Austin 3:16 shirt. Even though WrestleMania XIV earlier in the year had Mike Tyson, SummerSlam in 1998 actually seemed like a bigger show when it came down to it.\n\nAlso, the poster. Tell me this isn't one of the most bad ass event posters you have ever seen.\n\nOutside of Undertaker vs. Austin, the show also featured an iconic Intercontinental title ladder match between The Rock and Triple H which really put them on the map as future main eventers.\n\nThe rest of the card was highlighted by Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Hart \"Lion's Den Match\" (held at the nearby MSG Theatre), Edge and Sable vs. Marc Mero and Jacqueline, and Xpac vs. Jeff Jarrett, among others.\n\nThough a couple of the other shows on this list might have had more highly rated matches, the greatness of the top two bouts on this card and the fantastic build to the event itself puts it over the top and close to the top of our list.\n\nPreviousSlide 5/51. SummerSlam 2002\n\nSummerSlam 2002 is by far the most stacked card in the history of the event. For that matter, it's one of the best cards in company history. The top two matches featured Brock vs. Rock and the return of HBK. The rest of the card?\n\nOh, it only had: Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero, Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio, Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho, and RVD vs. Chris Benoit.\n\nWheew. Oh yeah, and those first two matches.\n\nIf you watched pro wrestling from 1998-2002, you know that nobody ever thought that we would see Shawn Michaels wrestle for WWE ever again. Let alone get a second run from him that would last from 2002 until 2010. In fact, this return by Shawn was supposed to only be a one-time thing, with Shawn possibly open to doing special occasion matches here and there if everything went alright. It turns out it went more than okay and Shawn ended up working a full time schedule for most of the next eight years.\n\nThis was just completely nuts. HBK came back and gave us a match of the year candidate in his first WWE performance in 4 1/2 years. It was and still is uncanny. I can't think of any parallels to it in wrestling history. It was like he hadn't missed a second of time in the ring.\n\nPlus, the slow build to the match and the dissension that built between Shawn and Hunter in the preceding weeks was so perfectly done. Both men deserve a lot of credit for what transpired at SummerSlam.\n\nRock vs. Brock for the Undisputed title felt like a big time, real fight. The videos WWE produced were like what you would see for a heavily hyped boxing or UFC fight. Some of the best WWE produced pre-match videos ever, you got to see both guys training hard for the big title match.\n\nAt this point, Rock was transitioning into a full time movie career and Brock Lesnar was the new big thing in pro wrestling. Rock passed the torch on this night and Brock became the youngest world champion in WWE history.\n\nStart Slideshow Back to Article Slide of\n\nby Ryan Droste | August 16, 2017", "id": "9806524",

Here are some of the highlights:\n\n\"That is one of my most special matches to date. To go out there and do what Big Show and I did together. I will go out on a limb and say you will never see anything like that again in this business. That's because there are no more men like us in this business. We are the last of a dying breed. I'm keeping the big man alive in the business and evolving it into what you are seeing now with the Braun Strowman character. I showed the world a glimpse, because you guys have only seen a glimpse of what I'm capable of doing. It was a big moment for me going out there and having that kind of match with Big Show.\"\n\nRelationship with Vince McMahon:\n\n\"Vince has been adamant that everything I do be spot-on, and when it's not, I know. That's part of the reason I take pride in what I do and give 100 percent of what I am capable of giving. That's because I know that not only are there millions of fans watching to make sure I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing, but the boss himself is watching, too. He is so hands-on and wants me to be a peak performance at all times.\"\n\n\"Just to share the ring with guys like Brock [Lesnar], [Samoa] Joe and [Roman] Reigns. They have all been doing this a lot longer than I have. They have been around the world and done it all. To be able to be in the main event of SummerSlam, about two years to the day when I debuted on Monday Night Raw. If that doesn't speak for itself.

The Universal title match should live up to its main-event billing and there are other bouts that have at least garnered my intrigue.\n\nHowever, the usual buzz surrounding SummerSlam doesn't seem to be there. Maybe it is because there are two pay-per-views per month -- one for Raw and one for Smackdown Live -- and it prevents fans from building up the needed anticipation for a long period of time.\n\nWhatever the reason, the anticipation just doesn't seem to be there.\n\nLack of buzz or not, we still got a bunch of matches to predict for the big show:\n\nWWE Universal championship - Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman vs. Samoa Joe\n\nI was ready to predict that Lesnar was going to lose the Universal championship Sunday until I saw the Barclays Center's tweet about his appearance for Raw the night after.\n\nThe tweet was eventually deleted, but we all know that means nothing in today's age. Fans cannot simply un-see what they already saw.\n\nIn case you forgot, the big stipulation surrounding the match is that Lesnar and his advocate Paul Heyman will leave WWE if he were to lose at SummerSlam.\n\nRegardless of that stipulation, I was picking against Lesnar. SummerSlam just felt like a good time for him to lose the title.\n\nBut the Barclays Center's tweet quickly changed my mind. WWE is not above disregarding a stipulation, as it has done so many times in the past.\n\nRemember when Vince McMahon was supposed to be gone from WWE forever after Fully Loaded 1999? Yeah, I don't think that stipulation stuck.\n\nBut in this specific instance, if Lesnar is slated to appear on Raw the night after SummerSlam, it will be because he is still the Universal champion.\n\nPrediction: Lesnar RETAINS the Universal championship\n\nWWE championship - Jinder Mahal (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nWith Baron Corbin's Money in the Bank contract out of the way, the road seems to be clear for Nakamura to end Mahal's reign as champion and begin his own.\n\nSince I am picking Lesnar to retain his title, I believe the other top title will change hands.\n\nPrediction: Nakamura WINS the WWE championship\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nWrestling fans are almost unanimously picking Cena to win here because ... it's John Cena and he almost always wins.\n\nBut fans did the same thing when he faced Nakamura a couple of weeks ago and they all turned out to be wrong.\n\nI think they will be wrong again, as I don't think Cena will simply hoist Corbin up for an attitude adjustment and beat him like he has done so many others.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I don't even think Corbin pins Cena. I don't think there will be a finish to this match.\n\nI think Corbin will be so enraged that Cena cost him his Money in the Bank cash-in that he will simply beat the daylights out of Cena and the match will be tossed out.\n\nPrediction: There is no finish\n\nWWE United States championship - AJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens\n\nShane McMahon is the special guest referee and will obviously play a factor in the outcome of the match.\n\nIf there is an Owens-Shane McMahon feud on the horizon then you have to imagine it will begin in earnest at SummerSlam.\n\nIf that is that is the case, Styles wins.\n\nPrediction: Styles RETAINS the United States championship\n\nWWE Raw Women's championship - Alexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks\n\nThis should be a fine match, but I am picking Banks to lose at SummerSlam for the second year in a row, and third time in a row during this particular weekend overall if you count the inaugural NXT Takeover: Brooklyn.\n\nI just don't see SummerSlam as the time for Bliss to lose the championship yet.\n\nPrediction: Bliss RETAINS the Raw Women's championship\n\nWWE Smackdown Women's championship - Naomi (c) vs. Natalya\n\nI believe part of the reason WWE had Corbin cash in before SummerSlam was to clear the way for Carmella to cash in her contract.\n\nI know WWE has strongly hinted at Carmella cashing in at SummerSlam, which usually means that it is not going to happen, but I think it still makes sense for it to happen Sunday.\n\nBefore the cash-in, I believe Naomi will retain her title.\n\nPrediction: Naomi RETAINS the Smackdown Women's championship, but Carmella cashes in Money in the Bank\n\nWWE Raw Tag Team championship - Sheamus & Cesaro (c) vs. Seth Rollins & Dean Ambrose\n\nI don't see two-thirds of The Shield losing on this stage, so I'm going with Ambrose and Rollins.\n\nPrediction: Rollins & Ambrose WIN the Raw Tag Team championships\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nWe just saw these two faceoff Monday night, but that was just ordinary Balor.\n\nOn Sunday, however, we will see the demonic side of Balor, which I suppose will completely change the complexion of the match.\n\nSince Balor will don the demon paint, I'm going with him to win.\n\nPrediction: Balor def. Wyatt\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nI honestly have no care in the world for this match, but I'm going with Orton to win.\n\nPrediction: Orton def. Rusev\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass\n\nEven with Enzo Amore being suspended high above the ring in a shark cage I still don't care to see this match.\n\nI'm going with Big Cass to pick up the victory.\n\nPrediction: Big Cass def. Big Show\n\nKickoff match - WWE Smackdown Tag Team championship - The New Day (c) vs. The Usos\n\nThese teams put on such a great performance at Battleground that I almost feel bad that this has been shoved to the kickoff show.\n\nThe optimistic view is that The New Day and The Usos will have plenty of time to put together another instant classic on the kickoff, which might not be the case if they were on the main card.\n\nWhen it is all said and done, I believe The New Day will hold on to the titles.\n\nPrediction: The New Day RETAINS the Smackdown Tag Team championships\n\nKickoff match - WWE Cruiserweight championship - Akira Tozawa (c) vs. Neville\n\nI don't see a reason to put the title back on Neville so soon, but I would not put it past WWE to do just that and have the rubber match take place on an upcoming episode of 205 Live.\n\nI hope that is not the case, which is why I am going with Tozawa.\n\nPrediction: Tozawa RETAINS the Cruiserweight championship\n\nVaughn Johnson has a podcast with Nick Piccone called the Straight Shooters on WildfireRadio.com.

WWE's second-biggest show of 2017 is going down Sunday beginning at 7 p.m. ET with a kickoff show starting two hours earlier at 5 p.m. ET. The monstrous card includes matches from both Raw and SmackDown and with nearly every title the company has to offer being defended on the six-plus hour program.\n\nCheck out our full slate of predictions for SummerSlam along with a complete match card below. Be sure to stay with CBS Sports the entire weekend as we go in-depth on SummerSlam live from Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to my podcast In This Corner with Brian Campbell where I break down everything you need to know each week. There will be instant analysis of SummerSlam immediately after the show.\n\n2017 WWE SummerSlam predictions\n\nCruiserweight Championship -- Akira Tozawa (c) vs. Neville (Kickoff Show)\n\nBrian Campbell: Tozawa's victory on Raw provided a nice surprise moment during Monday's go-home episode of Raw. But this remains Neville's division and \"The King of the Cruiserweights\" is still operating at a level above everyone else. Tozawa has looked good in recent weeks and this feud has done well to legitimatize him, but there are more talented 205-pound performers who better deserve to be the long-term successor. Pick: Neville wins the title\n\nAdam Silverstein: The rise of Tozawa has been impressive, and WWE fans are buying in. Neville is so versatile and obviously ready for a return to the main roster. It's a shame that crusierweights are relegated to only fighting those weighing 205 pounds or less because he really should have a hybrid role. It's time for the division to move on with fresh blood. Pick: Tozawa retainst he title\n\nSmackDown Tag Team Championship -- The New Day (c) vs. The Usos (Kickoff Show)\n\nAS: While it's a travesty a match and feud of this caliber is on the kickoff show, it was obviously moved to give them the 20-plus minutes necessary on a jam-packed card. Originally, I expected New Day to retain their titles, but in announcing the competitors beforehand, I think they're tipping the hand here towards a title change. Pick: The Usos win the titles\n\nBC: Provided they are given the time, this one has all the potential to be a memorable match. The extracurricular action outside the ring has also been increasingly physical in this rivalry. There's no reason to stop this feud anytime soon. Pick: The Usos win the titles\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass with Enzo Amore\n\nEnzo Amore will hang above the ring in a shark cage\n\nBC: Here's to hoping we see more of Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in this one as potential new stablemates for the heel version of Cass. Outside of that, this hasn't been the strongest build. Cass has already proven in multiple weeks that he can handle both Big Show and his former teammate Amore at the same time. Unless WWE is banking on a hometown pop for the New Jersey native Amore, look for Cass' singles push to continue. Pick: Big Cass wins\n\nAS: Why is this match happening? And why is WWE using the shark cage gimmick for the third time in nine months? Pick: Big Cass wins\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nAS: Why is this match happening? If Orton does not put Rusev over -- and after doing the job to Jinder Mahal so often, I'm not sure he's going to -- what is the point of this? Rusev could be a legitimate mid-carder in WWE, but they have slogged him down with this awful gimmick and have nothing planned for him. Pick: Orton wins\n\nBC: Despite the tremendous collective talent in this match, WWE has done a poor job giving us a reason to care about who wins or why they were paired together in the first place. That's about the nicest thing that can be said at this point. Pick: Rusev wins\n\nSmackDown Women's Championship -- Naomi (c) vs. Natalya\n\nBC: The best way to describe Naomi's title reign might be underwhelming at best. Some of that blame can certainly go to how she was booked, of course. Either way, this seems like the perfect setup for Carmella to cash in her Money in the Bank suitcase and create her SummerSlam moment. Pick: Carmella wins the title\n\nAS: It really is the perfect situation for Carmella to cash in for a victory, but it now seems too obvious -- and WWE would have no more MITB briefcase holders just a couple months after the event. WWE has done an awful job booking Naomi's championship run with multi-women No. 1 contender matches and pushing Lana as her only competitor for no reason. There will be a title change, though. Pick: Natalya wins the title\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nAS: Some believe that Corbin's failed cash-in on SmackDown will result in a win over Cena at SummerSlam to help him get heat back. That's not how I see it. I think WWE realized it made a mistake giving the briefcase to a guy who is just OK in the ring and absolutely awful on the mic. Corbin is not ready for the WWE title anytime soon. Maybe the United States championship? Cena is not going anywhere at the moment. There's no reason to give Corbin this victory unless you're going to extend their feud one more month because you have nothing better to do with either. Pick: Cena wins\n\nBC: Some much-needed buzz was added to this match when Cena's distraction played a role in preventing Corbin from successfully cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase Tuesday on SmackDown. Expect an angry Corbin to seek revenge in a big way and look for this match to serve as a litmus test for future of \"The Lone Wolf.\" If WWE still has huge plans for him, anything but a victory doesn't make sense. Pick: Corbin wins\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nBC: Wyatt capped his clean victory over Balor on Raw by pouring a bucket of blood over his head, thus guaranteeing we see the return of Balor's Demon character. That doesn't mean an automatic Balor victory comes with it, however. Wyatt has consistently gotten the upper hand in terms of the mental and supernatural warfare exchanged between both. If he's successful once again, could we see Balor bring his spiritual powers to the dark side along with Bray? Pick: Wyatt wins\n\nAS: This match is actually being billed as \"The Demon\" Finn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt, which is strange because they dropped \"king\" from the nickname and have completely ignored the gimmick since his return from injury. There is a surplus of singles talent on Raw, but Wyatt has actually won plenty recently, which I believe was done to set up a loss that will not hurt him in the least (for a change). You can't have Balor put on the demon gimmick and lose. Period. Pick: Balor wins\n\nRaw Tag Team Championship -- Sheamus & Cesaro (c) vs. Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins\n\nAS: Sheamus & Cesaro are a great tag team and have done a tremendous job as champions, but it's time for a change. The Ambrose-Rollins duo is hot, and unless WWE is going to pull a fast one and have Ambrose turn on Rollins immediately here -- which would be a mistake and not draw nearly the heat a longer-term tag team would -- they will win the straps. There is money in a rematch, and there are too many heel tag teams on the Raw roster at this point. There is more money in a full Shield reunion. Expect an extended reign and an eventual split. Pick: Ambrose & Rollins win the titles\n\nBC: Just the tease alone of this partial Shield reunion has consistently produced gigantic pops one each and every Raw episode throughout the build. There's no reason not to give the people what they want with a tag team title victory to pair with it. While a long-term breakup feels all but guaranteed, let's enjoy the ride for now. Pick: Ambrose & Rollins win the titles\n\nRaw Women's Championship -- Alexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks\n\nBC: The shoulder injury to Bayley turned out to be a blessing in disguise for WWE. Bliss and Banks, the two best women on the Raw brand, simply belong together on a showcase this large. This match also offers WWE a chance to finally give \"The Boss\" the kind of serious push she received in NXT but has only flirted with on the main roster. Pick: Banks wins the title\n\nAS: What he said. It's time for Banks to get her time in the sun with the title and the spotlight to herself without Charlotte Flair around. There are good feuds to be had with Bliss, Nia Jax, etc. Pick: Banks wins the title\n\nUnited States Championship -- AJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee\n\nAS: While Owens is great, his time as U.S. champion has run its course. The gimmick grew stale rather quickly, and he is so versatile that he does not need a title to get over. We have been screwed out of the Styles-Owens match we've wanted to this point, but SummerSlam is an opportunity for them to get it right while setting the stage for a future Owens-McMahon money match, possibly at Survivor Series. Pick: Styles retains the title\n\nBC: The quality of these two performers alone gives this potential to eclipse a four-star rating with ease. But adding McMahon as referee just makes it feel that much more important and special. In the end, Styles deserves to be the one retaining his belt, regardless of whether this match produces further heat between Owens and McMahon. Pick: Styles retains the title\n\nWWE Championship -- Jinder Mahal (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nAS: Conventional wisdom would have Mahal retaining the title as WWE is set for a tour of India soon. That's not how I see it. It would be rather difficult to imagine WWE elevating Nakamura to this level so quickly only to have him lose the biggest match of his career to a perennial jobber in Mahal. Rather, I think Nakamura gets the win -- and a massive, massive pop from the Brooklyn crowd -- only to lose the title to Mahal in a rematch while WWE tours in India. Nakamura losing overseas -- particiuarly with Mahal getting help form The Great Khali again -- would not hurt him one bit back here. It would also reaffirm Mahal as a champion despite him not deserving it. Pick: Nakamura wins the title\n\nUniversal Championship -- Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman vs. Samoa Joe\n\nLesnar and Paul Heyman will leave WWE if Lesnar loses the title\n\nBC: The expectation for violence and big spots in this one is off the charts. Simply put: You know a Fatal 4-Way match has a chance to be great when you make strong cases for all four participants to come out of the match with the championship. While WWE has done well to work the real-life talk of Lesnar entertaining a UFC return against Jon Jones into his wrestling storyline, adding a stipulation that Lesnar and Heyman would leave WWE with a loss, in the end it feels like a bit too quick and convenient. Look for \"The Beast\" to exit with the belt and (hopefully) a spinoff feud with Strowman. Pick: Lesnar retains the title\n\nAS: Stole my thunder here, BC. Absolutely agree that WWE only put in place that stipulation once it confirmed with Lesnar that he would not be returning to UFC, otherwise it would be just way too convenient for that to happen. But kudos to WWE for playing off the hype of a Lesnar-Jones match that may happen one day but just not now. There's only two ways this match goes. Either Lensar retains the title, as we predict, or Samoa Joe gets the strap. He's done a tremendous job since being elevated to the main event, and WWE cold probably squeak out one final Reigns-Strowman match next month before moving on. Lesnar-Strowman is so money, but I see it going down a bit later at Royal Rumble.

There are also a number of main events at SummerSlam that were downright terrible and there's really no other way to put that. The main event at what has become the second-biggest pay-per-view on the WWE calendar has given us so many different types of matches. We saw tag matches dominate the early years of the event, an Intercontinental Championship match that would steal just about any show out there, world title matches, Hell in a Cell matches, Triple Threat battles, one-on-one classics and unfortunately, some duds that had no business being anywhere near the main event.\n\nI'm sure -- and expect -- to get some arguments on this list but this is one wrestling writer's rankings of every single main event in SummerSlam history from worst to first, starting with a confusing and ridiculous match between a man and himself. Enjoy.\n\n1994 certainly wasn't the greatest year for the then-World Wrestling Federation and while there were still some solid matches throughout the year, the main event of SummerSlam certainly was not one of them as The Undertaker took on ... himself. Yeah, that's not a typo and those of you who are old enough to remember this disaster have probably tried to forget this entire thing happened as much as I have.\n\nWhat makes this whole thing even worse is that there was no title on the line in this match, which is something I just can't stand. The WWE Championship match that night in Chicago was a Steel Cage Match for the ages between Bret Hart and Owen Hart, which is still one of my favorite SummerSlam matches of all time. And yet this nine-minute debacle between Paul Bearer's Undertaker, the one you've known and loved for nearly three decades, and Ted Dibiase's Undertaker, played by Brian Lee, who became Chainz a few years down the road, was given the spotlight at the end of the night.\n\nYou know you're in trouble when a Chicago crowd isn't into your match and they were -- forgive the terrible pun that's about to happen here -- completely dead for this match and they had every right to be. There was so much awkwardness that even Vince McMahon himself basically bashed it on commentary. Throw in the Leslie Nielsen segments in the back throughout the evening and you're left with the worst main event in SummerSlam history. Easy call on this one. Oh, if you're actually curious on the outcome -- which you deserve as to not make yourself sit through this match on the WWE Network -- the \"real\" Undertaker walked away victorious.

The company's weekly TV shows build anticipation for the matches on PPV.\n\nThere are one or at most two PPV events a month, with only major events such as SummerSlam seeing matches from both Raw and Smackdown Live superstars on the same show.\n\nIn 2017, the show is a particularly big one, as Brock Lesnar wrestles for just the second time since WrestleMania.\n\nWHEN IS IT AND HOW CAN I WATCH IT?\n\nSUMMERSLAM will be held on Monday August 21 (Australian time), live on the WWE Network and on Foxtel's Main Event.\n\nThe pre-show will begin at 8AM AEST with the main card to begin at 10AM AEST.\n\nHERE are the matches currently scheduled for WWE SummerSlam 2017, with the card as always subject to change.\n\nWWE Universal Championship: Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman in a Fatal Four-Way Match\n\nWWE Championship: Jinder Mahal (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nWWE United States Championship: AJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens with special guest referee Shane McMahon\n\nWWE Raw Tag Team Championship: Cesaro and Sheamus (c) vs. Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose\n\nWWE Smackdown Tag Team Championship: The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) vs. The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a shark cage\n\nBrock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman in a Fatal Four-Way Match\n\nLESNAR won the championship at WrestleMania 33 by defeating Goldberg. He has defended the title just once since then, defeating Samoa Joe at Great Balls of Fire.\n\nBraun Strowman defeated Roman Reigns in an Ambulance Match at the same event, and since then the three potential contenders have battled it out week-by-week. Raw General Manager Kurt Angle eventually scheduled the four-way match.\n\nThe intrigue though comes from Paul Heyman's declaration that he and Lesnar will both leave WWE if Lesnar loses the Universal Championship.\n\nWhile Lesnar has been linked to a return to UFC, this is not possible for a long time due to his drug suspension. He is contracted until WrestleMania 34 while he was previously allowed to return to the octagon to fight Mark Hunt, Vince McMahon surely would not allow him to leave and fight during the peak January to April season.\n\nWe have seen stipulations like this one be ignored before, and there is always the potential Lesnar simply leaves for a few months and comes back for the Royal Rumble. In that scenario, one would expect Joe or Strowman to win the title, as making this Reigns' latest coronation victory seems unlikely. However Lesnar is the favourite with betting markets.\n\nTHE dramatic ending to the final Smackdown Live before SummerSlam made this match even more interesting.\n\nAfter he defeated John Cena to become the number one contender, the expectation of many was that Shinsuke Nakamura would defeat Jinder Mahal at SummerSlam in order to give Baron Corbin someone to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on. That in turn would set up a feud between Nakamura and Corbin.\n\nBut with Corbin cashing in and losing, thanks to interference from Cena, it opens the decision up to be more about the future of Mahal.\n\nThe surprise champion was put in his current position to appeal to the potential audience in India and it would be a surprise to see WWE give up on that quickly. With Corbin likely not involved in the match in any way now, Mahal could instead win to move on to another potential feud.\n\nIt is unclear who that would be though, and the momentum of Nakamura shouldn't be stopped in its tracks by having him lose in his first big title match.\n\nAJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens with special guest referee Shane McMahon\n\nTHE question here is when the title will stop changing hands between AJ Styles and Kevin Owens.\n\nOwens won the title back from Styles at Battleground in strange circumstances, which some reports suggest saw Vince McMahon make a mid-match call to give the title to Owens. That would explain the confusing nature of the finish.\n\nBacking that up is the fact that Styles won it back at the next opportunity, in a triple threat match on Smackdown Live which featured Styles pinning the returning Chris Jericho (who then vanished again).\n\nIn Owens' rematch, he was pinned despite both shoulders not being on the mat, and in an effort to solve the issue Shane McMahon was made the special guest referee.\n\nIt has appeared that Owens and McMahon were preparing to feud for some time now, with the Canadian nailing McMahon with a superkick (albeit as he was trying to hit Styles) on the final Smackdown Live before SummerSlam.\n\nWith that potential feud surely scheduled for a big event down the road such as Survivor Series, and not needing the United States championship in it, it would seem unlikely for McMahon to make the three count that gives Owens the title.\n\nTHIS was not the originally scheduled match, with Bayley currently on the sidelines after suffering a separated shoulder at the hands of Nia Jax in a match on Raw.\n\nSasha Banks won her way into the match after winning a triple threat against Alicia Fox and Emma, and then beating Jax. This made sense given that she was feuding with Bayley over the number one contendership before Bayley's injury.\n\nBut that story appeared to be trending towards a Banks heel turn on her friend. If that is still in the plans, Bliss may hold on to the title for a while longer.\n\nONE Money in the Bank contract may be out of the way, but another looms large over this match.\n\nNaomi defends her title against Natalya at SummerSlam but with Carmella currently holding a briefcase and title opportunity, the question is if she will cash in during or after the match.\n\nThe fact that Carmella has been so present in the build-up to this match suggests she won't - not yet, anyway - as WWE likes cash-ins to be surprises. This is otherwise essentially a toss-up.\n\nCesaro and Sheamus (c) vs. Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose\n\nTWO thirds of The Shield has finally reunited with Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose doing the classic fist bump on the final Raw before SummerSlam.\n\nThat has left Cesaro and Sheamus as side pieces in this feud. So the question is whether Rollins and Ambrose will continue on to bigger and better things from here. It would make sense for them to do so.\n\nThe New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) vs. The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n\nSOMETIMES the equation is pretty simple - if you get the better of your opponents on the last show before the PPV, you generally lose later that week.\n\nThe Usos pinned Kofi Kingston in a non-title match on Smackdown Live, and it would make sense for New Day to move on as champions.\n\nA TERRIFIC match on Raw saw Akira Tozawa shockingly end Neville's long title reign and claim the championship just six days before their SummerSlam match.\n\nIt would be odd if Tozawa then quickly gave the belt back, although there is always the potential for the Titus Worldwide crew to cost him.\n\nCorbin became just the third man to lose his Money in the Bank title match - and ironically, John Cena has been involved in all three of those matches - when he was pinned by Jinder Mahal on this past week's edition of Smackdown Live.\n\nCorbin having the briefcase and cashing in on Shinsuke Nakamura seemed like an easy plot to pick but now that obviously can't happen; but that also changes his match with Cena.\n\nCena lost to Nakamura clean in their number one contendership match but at this stage of his career it isn't a surprise to see him losing to rising stars.\n\nIf Corbin is still a rising star, then it would be strange for him to both fail on the cash-in and lose to Cena. If WWE has soured on him suddenly then things may be very different.\n\nThe latter - which will be in attendance on Monday morning - has usually meant big things for Balor but as he feuds with Bray Wyatt, it is difficult to tell where things are going; as per usual for a Wyatt feud.\n\nUsing the 'advantage on Monday' rule of thumb Balor should win, but this could go either way.\n\nREPORTS from those in the know suggest that Rusev was scheduled for the 'evil foreigner' role Jinder Mahal is currently filling before the call was made to play for Indian fans.\n\nRandy Orton's win over Mahal on Smackdown Live a week ago was slightly odd, but likely an attempt to simply keep him strong after losing the feud.\n\nBut Orton's trajectory surely isn't going up - it would be very odd for him to go after the title again - while Rusev could be a threat for Shinsuke Nakamura or another top face in the near future.\n\nPredicted winner: Rusev\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a shark cage\n\nSHARK cage!\n\nThis usage of the stipulation makes a bit more sense than when NXT put Paul Ellering in one for a TakeOver special. Enzo Amore keeps going after Big Cass and Big Cass keeps beating him, but he needs to be involved because fans love him.\n\nThe one way a shark cage ever seems to be used is for the person in there to drop a weapon down to whoever they favour in the match. That would be a way to get Big Show the win here, but given the state of the veteran's career, surely the build of Cass will continue.", "id": "9646375", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Lesnar gone?

Here's why keeping the Universal Championship on him is the smart idea.\n\nBrock Lesnar faces a tall task in Brooklyn on Sunday. The Universal Champion enters WWE SummerSlam with three foes instead of one. Even worse for the champion, he doesn't have to factor into the decision at all to lose his title.\n\nHis advocate, Paul Heyman, has made it clear that if Lesnar does not retain his title, then they are both leaving. Of course, this could very well be a strong indicator that he is indeed going to retain on Sunday.\n\nHowever, this isn't just a matter of keeping the belt on him. There are plenty of justifiable reasons as to why a title change isn't necessary yet. Here are five reasons for making the case for Lesnar to remain Universal Champion.\n\nThe simplest and easiest answer is that it means more Paul Heyman. The beauty of having Heyman as his advocate is that he can progress the story without Lesnar always having to be there.\n\nAs evidenced in the Samoa Joe feud, Heyman did a tremendous job of carrying that feud along himself with his mic work. If Lesnar remains the champ, then Heyman gets to grace the ring with his appearance still.\n\nIn a time where managers aren't prevalent like they used to be, Heyman is the last of an old breed.

That sets a very good example, a stage for the future, so that we might have a Chinese star as a WWE champion.\n\n\"I certainly hope that soon we will have a bona fide superstar champion from China.\"\n\nWWE kicked off their recruitment efforts in China last year by signing Tian Bing as their first mainland performer.\n\nThey then stepped things up by bringing in seven new Chinese recruits to their Performance Centre in Florida earlier this year.\n\n\"I can't really think to the development of the storylines, but we can see visible development of our Chinese stars,\" added Li.\n\nRonda Rousey to WWE? Get in line, says SmackDown 'Queen' Charlotte Flair on Shenzhen trip\n\n\"Our Chinese recruits under development contracts are going through rigorous training, learning in-ring skills, character development. They're all doing great.\"\n\nSome of them will return to China for the Shenzhen live event, while decorated martial artist Li Xia will represent China in the \"Mae Young Classic\", an all-female tournament premiering on the WWE Network on August 28.\n\nIt continues a concerted effort on all fronts to establish WWE in China, including the launch last week of the WWE Network in partnership with Chinese video streaming website PPTV.\n\n\"We started in China 10 years ago, and we've always been seeking to understand consumer demand, as well as regional and environmental factors before taking the next step forward,\" said Li.\n\n\"Our market research indicated we have access to 140 million fans who are interested in consuming WWE content.\n\n\"We took a methodical step last year to bring Raw and SmackDown in their entirety, in Mandarin and English, to Chinese audiences live on PPTV.\n\nWWE Network set for China launch as battle for lucrative mainland market heats up\n\n\"We had fantastic results which gave us further confidence that using a digital-first strategy will allow us to tap into a vast pool of consumers interested in our product.\"\n\nIn April, WWE ran its biggest show of the year, WrestleMania, as a pay-per-view event on PPTV for the first time.\n\n\"We had more interest than we expected, so we felt the timing is finally right to bring our subscription model of the WWE Network to Chinese consumers so they can have access to all of our content.\n\n\"Not just Raw or SmackDown, but all of our original programming.

Obviously I've had big matches all around the world, but I think the biggest thing is [Sunday] at SummerSlam, one of the biggest kind of pay-per-view franchises in the industry, and I am in the main event. So yeah, by far this is the biggest match of my career.\n\nQ: Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman have said they will leave WWE if Brock loses. If you are the reason that happens, what would it mean to add that distinction to your career?\n\nA: (Laughs) It would be great. To be the guy that ran Brock Lesnar out of WWE, that is definitely a title I would love to hold and am looking to accomplish next Sunday.\n\nQ: What's your relationship with Brock and Paul backstage? I know there has been talk that they are big supporters of yours.\n\nA: I think there is a lot of mutual respect there, for the most part. I think we both understand and have great respect for what we bring to the table. So, it's at times amicable.\n\nQ: You think that is one of the reasons the match at Great Balls of Fire (which Lesnar won) went the way it did, and both you guys left looking pretty good?\n\nA: Absolutely, I think Brock and Paul definitely understand the intensity that I bring to the table and the vibe that I put out there whenever I'm getting ready for big matches. They recognized it for the big match that it was. I definitely did. At the end, I think it went to a lot of the fans enjoyment.\n\nQ: The last time you performed at Barclays on SummerSlam weekend, you lost the NXT title to Shinsuke Nakamura. What do you remember most about that night?\n\nA: I think the biggest thing I remember is how many fans from around the world come into Brooklyn, along with the native New Yorkers to attend these events, to attend this weekend. SummerSlam has kind of become part of this big Red Hook renaissance? Everybody comes out. It's an event to attend and be a part of. So it is really cool to kind of see the atmosphere. It's very international and it's very, very lively.\n\nQ: What's it like performing with Shinsuke in the ring? He is known for his strong style.\n\nA: Shinsuke, he is by far one of the best competitors in the world. It is no surprise to me that he found his way to WWE. I think when you look at the WWE roster now you are seeing guys who are consistently the top guys in this industry, all around the world, converging on WWE in all these events, SummerSlam, WrestleMania. It is a really, really cool time to be a wrestling fan.\n\nQ: You have said in the past that when you first signed with WWE it was basically an NXT/merchandise deal and not a full-time one because you were in your 30s. How did you take it at the time?\n\nA: I took it as an opportunity, which is what it was. I think something that escapes a lot of people is my entire career ... I call myself the \"often unwanted\" because when I got to Ring of Honor I was told it was supposed to be one-off deal. I said, \"That's fine,\" knowing that when I went in there it was going to be more than that and it was.\n\nWhen I got to TNA, I was brought in because they didn't have television. They told me, \"Hey listen, we like you because you have an internet following,\" and that was where they were broadcasting their shows predominantly and there was much more [for me] after that.\n\nI knew once I got there and I did my thing that wouldn't be the case and it wasn't. When I got to the WWE, when I was presented with that initial opportunity, I knew once again it was my oyster to crack open and take the prize. That's what I did, and I find myself here in the main event of SummerSlam.\n\nQ: Why do you think that so many organizations have thought you didn't fit what they wanted or viewed you as a one-off thing?\n\nA: It's tough to say. I think it's obviously timing and being circumstantial. I think it's varying different views. With Ring of Honor, it was more of a budgetary issue. I was a California guy and to pay that flight consistently every month, it was a tough go for them as a starting-up company at the time. They found the money and they made the time and brought me on full time.\n\nWith TNA it was very different situation. They didn't have television. They were transferring from FOX to working out the Spike [TV] deal. Basically they were just trying keep a buzz and to bring in names that would turn the heads to the audience they were aiming to reach at the time.\n\nWith WWE, I have been on the outskirts of this company for the majority of my career, so an opportunity presented itself. NXT was a new hot product and specifically I was more or less brought in to help build the brand. Based on my efforts, I was brought up to the main roster.\n\nQ: How much do you think things going well with WWE and getting a chance at the Universal title now goes back to the following that you brought with you to WWE?\n\nA: I think the fans that I brought here are a major reason and a major component to my experience here. You get guys who say they have a following and they have something incoming and make an impact in the past, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But in my case I was fortunate enough that fans of mine of the long term that stuck with me and have been more than supportive when I have been here in WWE.\n\nQ: Was there ever a point where you thought getting a chance at WWE wasn't going to happen and just said if it doesn't, it wasn't meant to be?\n\nA: Yeah. I think I resigned myself that I was going to give it a shot and if it worked out great, great. If it didn't, it didn't, you know? I've had a fantastic career up until my signing, more than most guys that choose this as a profession could ask for. So what I am doing now in WWE is just kind of I am in the bonus, and I am definitely enjoying it.\n\nQ: How did your judo and MMA background shape your wrestling style?\n\nA: I think martial arts in general shaped my wrestling style. I think I grew up as a martial artist as a kid. It helped my transition easily into this career as an adult. I think a lot of the concepts and a lot of the technique that I had picked up early on definitely helped me in my career so far.\n\nI think it helped define a newer style of wrestling that you see predominantly now, both on the independent and internationally and even here in WWE. It's had a tremendous influence on my style and what I like to do in the ring.\n\nQ: Do you think the popularity of MMA now is why wrestlers are starting to incorporate it more or people have just started to train in it along the way?\n\nA: I think it is a combination of all those factors. I think guys are becoming more well-rounded grapplers in training and some guys are going back to the really, really old-school base fundamentals of professional wresting. A lot of early MMA was pretty much shoot wrestling, so I think in some ways it's something new. It's something that evolved over time. It's a lot of rediscovery of older techniques and older mindsets on how to approach a match.\n\nQ: Was mortgage broker really your last job before becoming a wrestler or was there something else in between?\n\nA: There were tons of things. Obviously, I worked for my family's Polynesian dance troupe for my entire life up until I started wresting full time. Mortgage broker, bouncer, party rental warehouse manager. I did any and all things to keep the rent paid.\n\nQ: How good were you at those?\n\nA: I was pretty good at all of them, but they were not things that I really wanted to do.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on Roman Reigns?\n\nA: I think when you look at the top, elite performers in this industry right now, I think Roman Reigns is in that discussion. I think he is a polarizing figure, which is always a great thing in this business. I think whatever success that he comes by he works for, so I give him that credit.\n\nQ Braun Strowman?\n\nA: Braun by far is probably one of the most, how should I phrase this. For how little time he's spent in the industry, his knowledge and his abilities have grown 10 fold every week. He is a guy that is constantly improving. He is constantly getting better. Now he is probably one of the biggest consummate, complete acts in the industry.\n\nQ: A.J. Styles?\n\nA: It's in his moniker and it's absolutely deserved. He's phenomenal. I've worked with A.J. all around the world for the better part of my career. He's never lost a step. He's only gotten better, and he continues to deliver fantastic matches, so I don't know what else you could ask for from a performer of his caliber.\n\nQ: Who was your biggest wrestling influence?\n\nA: There's a lot. Real quiet, I saw a lot of UWFI (Union of Wrestling Forces International) growing up, so the [Nobuhiko] Takada's of the world and then at the same time, guys like Arn Anderson really appealed to me, very business-like. They were really deadly at any given time. They just had an innate ability to take apart their opponents. Those are two big influences of many.\n\nQ: Have you gotten a chance to sit down with Arn since joining the company?\n\nA: Absolutely, and I've enjoyed my discussion with him. He's a wealth of knowledge and of attitude.\n\nQ: Wrestler past or present you'd love to have a match with?\n\nA: Bruiser Brody, I always say. I would love to have gotten in the ring with him and throw it around a little bit. Presently now, there are really far too many to list. We haven't even scratched the surface as far as dream matches in WWE. I think in the coming weeks and months we will definitely see some of that come to fruition.\n\nQ: Favorite hobby in your off-time?\n\nA: I'm a big gamer, I think like most people my age (38). I'm a big reader. Whenever I am on the road, if I am in an airplane or on a bus, I am usually cracking a book and taking in some reading.\n\nQ: Favorite game and book?\n\nA: Favorite game? I really can't even scratch the surface on that because there are too many I've played.\n\nQ: Are you a Call of Duty guy?\n\nA: Literally the entire gamut, everything from first-person shooters to RPGs to sports games.

As of this writing, 12 matches are crammed into pro wrestling's second-biggest event of the year. Out of necessity, WWE has moved the start time of the pay-per-view up and expanded to a four-hour format. And that extra hour is in addition to a two-hour kickoff show, which will also feature at least one match. If this sounds familiar, it should. WWE similarly expanded WrestleMania in April to accommodate 13 matches, three of which were on the kickoff show.\n\nExactly where all of the matches will fall on the SummerSlam card is unclear, but we do know it might be in your best interest to consult with a psychic before making predictions. Is the Psychic Friends Network still around?\n\nBrock Lesnar's rumored interest in returning to UFC is playing out on WWE TV. Paul Heyman has stipulated that Lesnar will leave WWE if he loses the match. In reality, his contract runs through next year's WrestleMania. So, it's pretty much a lock that we'll see him again on Monday nights in the future. But is that enough of a guarantee that he'll walk out of the Barclays Center with the Universal Title around his waist? And of his three competitors -- Samoa Joe, Roman Reigns, and Braun Strowman -- who is most likely to slay the Beast?\n\n>>LISTEN: The Taz Show: Bodyslams & Beyond weekdays 7-9 a.m.\n\nAnother question to ponder: Is WWE is ready to pass the torch to Shinsuke Nakamura? It was a shock when Jinder Mahal captured the championship a few months back. Many are also surprised the reign of the Modern Day Maharaja has lasted this long. Given the company's heavy expansion in India, though, it makes a lot of sense. Then again, WWE could also build its Japanese base substantially by giving the belt to the man who was arguably one of the biggest stars in the Asian country's rich wrestling history.\n\nI've invited Rolling Stone's Aaron Oster and TV Insider's Scott Fishman back to make their best guesses as to how everything will shake out. We're all out to redeem ourselves from a dismal effort picking WWE Battleground. No one picked above .500 for the last pay-per-view, but Aaron did manage to slightly extend his overall lead (percentage-wise) for the year.\n\nUniversal Championship - Fatal 4-Way Match\n\nBrock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman\n\nChuck: As of this writing, the sportsbooks have Brock Lesnar as the favorite. As I stated above, a loss doesn't necessarily preclude him from appearing in WWE again. I could see a scenario where Roman Reigns wins and he and Lesnar have a rematch at WrestleMania. But the more likely outcome is that Lesnar retains with Reigns then becoming the challenger at WrestleMania. Think about it. Reigns retires the man that snapped the Undertaker's uncanny undefeated streak. Then, one year after retiring the Undertaker, Reigns also defeats Lesnar to cement himself as John Cena's heir apparent. But SummerSlam belongs to Brooock Lesssnarrrr (done in best Paul Heyman voice). Pick: Brock Lesnar\n\nAaron: For all the problems up and down the card here, the one thing they've nailed was this match. They've created an incredibly compelling match, despite not really having a true babyface in this one. They've created a scenario where anyone could walk out with the title, and it would be hard to be surprised by it. And it should be a relatively unprecedented match: four athletic horses that can put on a show. I think there's a compelling case to put the belt on Joe, as they've found the right opponent and right formula for him to ride the wave of momentum. However, at the end of the day, a match where a single competitor dethrones Brock is where the money is. Pick: Brock Lesnar\n\nScott: Even with rumors of Brock Lesnar and UFC, I believe the 'Beast Incarnate' isn't done just yet. The seeds were planted for Braun Strowman and Lesnar at the end of Raw, and these two have the potential to build on that past SummerSlam. As much as I would enjoy seeing Samoa Joe win the gold in such a high-profile way, I am giving the edge to Lesnar, especially with the stipulation of if he loses then he leaves WWE. Pick: Brock Lesnar\n\nChuck: Absent the Great Khali, I'm not seeing Mahal retaining here. Shinsuke Nakamura is red hot right now, and WWE is going to need a major title change at a pay-per-view of this caliber (assuming Lesnar wins). Had Baron Corbin not cashed in his Money In The Bank contract on SmackDown, it would have been plausible for Mahal to win and Corbin to then make his move. Instead, the Singh Brothers will get involved, but Nakamura will ignite the crowd. Pick: Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nAaron: Tuesday's events with Baron Corbin losing the briefcase threw me for a loop. I thought for sure that Nakamura would win, and Corbin would cash in, creating the feud for the fall on SmackDown Live. Obviously that's not happening. However, I'm sticking to my guns here. They would be insane to rush Nakamura into a title match with pretty much no build if they didn't want him to come away with the title. Pick: Shinsuke Nakamura\n\nScott: SummerSlam is the prime spot for Nakamura to secure the WWE Championship and make history. The 'King of Strong Style' is undefeated, relatively speaking, since making his debut on SmackDown Live. I don't want to believe that ends at SummerSlam. Pick: Shinsuke Nakamura\n\n>>MORE: 13 Things You Didn't Know About WWE Superstar Jinder Mahal\n\nUnited States Championship (Shane McMahon guest referee)\n\nAJ Styles (c) vs. Kevin Owens\n\nChuck: You have to figure that Shane McMahon is going to get physical after being inadvertently taken out by Styles and Owens in successive weeks. Since Styles and McMahon have already had their feud, it's pretty much a certainty that KO will land in the commissioner's crosshairs. I could even see Shane O'Mac costing the new face of America the match. Either way, there's a zero chance this one ends cleanly. Pick: AJ Styles\n\nAaron: Everything is pointing towards Shane McMahon vs. Kevin Owens as a match down the line. Even if he calls this one straight down the middle, Owens can blame Shane for the loss after this loss. Plus, if Nakamura does come out as champion, an Owens-Nakamura feud for the title would be pretty epic. Pick: AJ Styles\n\nScott: There is definitely the potential of a face turn for Kevin Owens in the future. At the same time, there is also the potential of a one-on-one match between Shane McMahon and Owens. This could be the catalyst for that. Look for some shenanigans in this one. Pick: AJ Styles\n\nChuck: The Shield reunion has played out masterfully. Unlike so many storylines, WWE did not rush this and let it build and build. Every week there was a tease without a payoff until, finally, on Monday night Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins put their fists together. The pop was deafening, and there's no way WWE's brass didn't hear it. The Shield run is on ... for now. Pick: Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins\n\nAaron: A Dean Ambrose heel turn is very much in play here, as I believe that's where this is inevitably heading. The question is: Does it happen here, or down the line? I'll give The Shield a little bit of a reunion before the turn though. The pop was deafening on Monday night, so milk a little bit out of that before they move into a feud with one another. Pick: Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins\n\nScott: WWE has done a great job with the Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose story. The fans were clearly invested on Raw and in prior weeks. A run with the tag team titles would be a fun development. At the same time, the company could have Sheamus and Cesaro win because Ambrose and Rollins aren't on the same page. I can visualize each scenario playing out, going to give the nod to new champions in Ambrose and Rollins. Pick: Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins\n\nRaw Women's Championship\n\nAlexa Bliss (c) vs. Sasha Banks\n\nChuck: Bayley's injury has thrown this match for a loop. Kudos to WWE for scrambling to put it together as quickly as they did. The injury, in all likelihood, will also postpone Banks turning heel. They need a babyface champion after keeping the belt on Alexa for a while. The Boss takes this one and ushers in her glory days. Pick: Sasha Banks\n\nAaron: Sasha needs to win this match. She's been thwarted time and time again since ending the feud with Charlotte, and at some point she has to overcome the nonsense if she's going to continue to be at the top of the division. And with Bayley out, they need to solidify her as a true face who can be counted on. Obviously this wasn't their original plan, but with the division in a current state, an Alexa win, even a dirty one, would be a mistake. Pick: Sasha Banks\n\nScott: With Bayley out, WWE may want to stretch out the feud between Alexa Bliss and Sasha Banks. They could also go the route with Banks taking on Nia Jax. There might be more options at the moment with the 'Five Feet of Fury.' Pick: Alexa Bliss\n\nSmackDown Women's Championship\n\nNaomi (c) vs. Natalya\n\nChuck: The same Money In The Bank cash-in scenario is in play as my original idea to have Baron Corbin hand over his briefcase at SummerSlam. So, playing the role of Baron will be Carmella. I see Natalya winning and then immediately losing to Carmella. I will honestly feel bad for Natalya at that point. She deserves a title run. Pick: Natalya\n\nAaron: Since Corbin can no longer cash in a briefcase, I think the chances of a Carmella cash-in after this match just went way up. And if that happens, then Naomi will likely win the match. If they don't want Carmella to cash in, then Natalya probably wins it, but I really think Carmella cashes in, maybe to a hometown pop? Either way, a heel walks out of Brooklyn with the title. Charlotte and Becky are waiting. Pick: Naomi\n\nScott: They are making it too obvious for Carmella do the predictable cash-in at SummerSlam, especially when Baron Corbin's failed attempt happened just a few days ago. Plus, I am a Nattie fan and think she has earned one more run with the title. So, I might be letting that cloud my overall pick. Maybe Carmella and James Ellsworth even step in to help Nattie in the end. Pick: Natalya\n\nSmackDown Tag Team Championship (Kickoff Match)\n\nThe New Day (c) vs. The Usos\n\nChuck: It won't be a new day for The Usos. The New Day will exit the ring with the same titles they entered with. I've thoroughly enjoyed this feud though and still laugh about their rap battle. I hope the Usos don't fade back into oblivion. They are the most talented tag team on SmackDown right now. It makes me wonder whether they'll be moved over to Raw if WWE opts for a fall roster shakeup. Maybe Cesaro and Sheamus then find their way over to the blue team? Pick: The New Day\n\nAaron: The New Day did not come over from Raw and get all the hype on their return, just to lost the title after a month. As great as The Usos are, and they are great, The New Day are still the guys who sell the merch and who are the top guys in the tag division. They gave The Usos the win on Tuesday to retain their credibility, but The New Day win here. Pick: The New Day\n\nScott: The Usos have had the number of New Day leading up to SummerSlam, so to me, it can only mean the challengers lose. The show will need its share of feel good victories. I believe New Day retaining is going to be one of them. Pick: The New Day\n\nChuck: I just don't know why this match occurred on Raw. It makes zero sense to me and, frankly, it's not going to draw any extra attention to Sunday's contest. I don't want to call this a throwaway match, because a championship is on the line, but I will say it has been severely cheapened. Let's hope they put on an incredible five-star performance. Pick: Akira Tozawa\n\nAaron: I'm honestly unsure what to make of this match, if it even happens. I like the idea of Tozawa winning it, as winning it on SummerSlam likely would have been buried. Doing it on Monday gives him the spotlight, as backwards as it initially seems. However, if they still have the match at SummerSlam, and Tozawa wins again, losing twice in six days deals a major blow to Neville's credibility. It's hard to see them giving the title right back to Neville though, so I'll go with him. Pick: Akira Tozawa\n\nScott: Akira Tozawa surprised many when he won the Cruiserweight Championship on Raw. Losing the gold, pushed Neville over the edge into madness. I can see losing to Tozawa a second time pushing him further into the direction of the Mad King. I don't want Neville to win back the title so quickly, as I think it tarnishes the Raw moment for Tozawa. Pick: Akira Tozawa\n\n'The Demon' Finn B\u00e1lor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nChuck: I wish WWE would have invested more time in this feud rather than have Finn B\u00e1lor work a brief program with Elias. The Monday night go-home segment between the two was pretty righteous though. It was pro wrestling's version of Carrie. Now with 'The Demon' awakened in B\u00e1lor, the odds of him losing are minimal. Pick: Finn B\u00e1lor\n\nAaron: I was shocked by how cleanly Bray won on Monday. I get the storyline, but that was shockingly decisive. But The Demon is coming out to play on Sunday night. Finn B\u00e1lor isn't losing with the return of The Demon (and we should all be grateful that it isn't The Demon King). Pick: Finn B\u00e1lor\n\nScott: I don't think WWE would bring out the Demon to have him lose. This is basically Clark Kent turning into Superman. A loss here would do some damage for B\u00e1lor, especially since the company made such a big deal about the Demon returning. Wyatt got his win on Raw, so B\u00e1lor will get it back at SummerSlam. Pick: Finn B\u00e1lor\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nChuck: Conventional wrestling wisdom will tell you that a man on his way out should lose his match. And with free agent John Cena apparently moving to Raw, he should do the honors here. Cena has been gracious in putting over Shinsuke Nakamura in recent weeks and doing the same here would give Corbin a nice rub. Plus, Corbin needs to reestablish himself as a threat after failing in his attempt to cash in his Money In The Bank contract. Pick: Baron Corbin\n\nAaron: Cena costing Corbin his briefcase on Tuesday could mean that Corbin wins here. However, I'm going another way with it. Cena wins, likely via DQ, and then Corbin annihilates him after the match. It would give Cena a reason to go away for a bit again, and potentially turns Corbin into a monster. Pick: John Cena\n\nScott: Baron Corbin losing the Money in the Bank briefcase on SmackDown Live was no doubt a big shock. Corbin has much to gain by defeating John Cena and coming back from such a devastating loss. The company is high on the 'Lone Wolf,' and a win over the leader of the CeNation puts him back in the game. I would expect some shenanigans here as well. Cena is also advertised for Raw shows in the immediate future. Pick: Baron Corbin\n\n>>MORE: 16 Things You Didn't Know About WWE Superstar John Cena\n\nBig Show vs. Big Cass (Enzo Amore suspended in a Shark Cage)\n\nChuck: WWE's creative team deserves another pat on the back for this feud. Much like the Shield reunion, they took their time splitting Enzo and Big Cass. This appears to be the finale of the feud, and Big Cass has a rocket on him right now. It has been an eternity since a heel has received the type of reception he did on Monday night, and that's exactly what WWE needs. And yes, Enzo will get involved here. Pick: Big Cass\n\nAaron: Is this the first ever match where the face manager gets locked in a cage? Unless this match changes due to Show's broken hand, Big Cass needs to go over here. Let him win, and win cleanly. Pick: Big Cass\n\nScott: The Big Show is big on putting over emerging talent and doing the honors for the greater good. A victory for Cass definitely would go a long way moving forward if WWE really wants to give him a solid singles run. With Enzo involved, he can easily play a role in the proceedings from the shark cage for either side. Expect him to play a role in the finish. Pick: Big Cass\n\nRandy Orton vs. Rusev\n\nChuck: Who needs this win more, Rusev or Randy Orton? Neither appear to be locks to get back in the title picture, so you can scratch that thought right now. Rusev has had his moments since his return, but doesn't have that big win yet. He lost to John Cena at Battleground and could use a win here. I just don't see that happening for the Bulgarian Brute here. Randy Orton gets this one. Pick: Randy Orton\n\nAaron: Rusev needs this win. Randy Orton doesn't. They even had Orton get more attacks in during the feud. So why am I so concerned that they're going to screw this up? I'll go with Rusev, because all the logic screams Rusev, but this may be a match where logic doesn't matter. Pick: Rusev\n\nScott: Randy Orton carries on after losing the WWE Championship and uses Rusev to rebound. I think WWE wants to keep RKO in the title hunt. I can also see them go to a disqualification or count out to set up another match between the two and keep both guys looking strong. Pick: Randy Orton\n\n>>MORE: 14 Things You Didn't Know About WWE Superstar Randy Orton", "id": "9744078", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "WWE Insiders Pick SummerSlam 2017", "image": "https://cbsstlouis.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/brock-lesnar-summerslam-2015.jpg?w=628", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}, "id": "302655", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "id": "304688", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "id": "306411", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

He has been nigh unbeatable since returning to professional wrestling in 2012. He ended the Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania. His time as UFC heavyweight champion gives him legitimate fighting credibility that most wrestlers can't match.\n\nBut as Lesnar prepares to defend the WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam on Sunday, do all his extracurriculars add to his aura of invincibility, or make him surprisingly vulnerable? Newly crowned UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones is talking up a super fight with Lesnar, and WWE has already hinted that bout could affect the story it's telling with Lesnar and the championship.\n\nTo sort all this out, Inverse partnered with Unanimous A.I. to enlist a swarm of more than 30 of our wrestling fan readers to predict how Lesnar will fare Sunday. As you can see in the animation below, each participant controlled a little golden magnet and used it to drag the puck toward the answer they thought was the most likely outcome. Also, the closer a user puts the magnet to the puck, the greater the pulling force. This is where the hive-mind comes in: As the user sees the puck move toward an outcome, it triggers a psychological response. The user starts to readjust their decision-making, building toward a consensus.\n\nSo then, in the fatal four-way match between Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman, Roman Reigns, and Samoa Joe, who does our swarm think will emerge victorious?\n\nThat was pretty definitive! You can see initial pockets of support for each of the challengers, with Strowman appearing to lose support first. But the hive-mind quickly settles on Lesnar retaining. What's a little stranger is how the swarm thinks Jon Jones will figure into SummerSlam, where he's been rumored to make some sort of appearance. With his role ranging from no-show to active interference in Lesnar's title match, the swarm decided to go big.\n\nAgain, you can see the magnets initially pulling in all directions, but the consensus quickly breaks in favor of Jones full-on interfering in the match. Let's leave aside the very reasonable question of whether the UFC would actually allow Jones to be so involved in the show, even if it is to promote what should be a massively lucrative fight between him and Lesnar. What's really intriguing here is the same swarm picked Lesnar to win and Jones to interfere. Our hive-mind either thinks Jones would get involved to help Lesnar win -- perhaps UFC allegiance trumps all? -- or they believe Lesnar is so strong he could overcome even Jones's attempts to screw him over. Given how WWE has treated Lesnar since his return, that's not impossible.\n\nTo read more about how Unanimous A.I. uses swarm A.I. to reach scarily accurate predictions, check out our previous article on how Unanimous A.I. uses \"swarm intelligence\" to make predictions.", "id": "9806502", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "\"Swarm A.I.\" Predicts Brock Lesnar Will Win Big At SummerSlam", "image": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/2a/e2/95/8c/8121/4737/a7cb/e8ec30621541/brock-lesnar-and-his-advocate-paul-heyman.jpeg?rect=0%2C35%2C900%2C450&fm=png&w=1200", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}, "id": "304132", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Psychology"}, "id": "304392", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "id": "304688", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "id": "306411", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Force"}, "id": "307271", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"}, {"label": {"eng": "Magnet"}, "id": "309947", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}, "id": "309979", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "id": "315017", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "id": "315019", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}, "id": "330445", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swarm behaviour"}, "id": "331124", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "id": "331294", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}, "id": "336108", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Undertaker"}, "id": "340565", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undertaker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brock Lesnar"}, "id": "340572", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of UFC champions"}, "id": "346524", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}, "id": "349082", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns"}, {"label": {"eng": "Group mind (science fiction)"}, "id": "508754", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "id": "1272200", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Streak (wrestling)"}, "id": "1277085", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streak_(wrestling)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 297, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 872, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 897, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 990, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1055, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1056, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1151, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy of Mind", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Mind"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1184, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1281, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Knowledge Management/Knowledge Creation", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Knowledge_Management/Knowledge_Creation"}], "time": "19:29:00"}

Mahal's run as the champ needs to end but not because of the performer. Last Tuesday, WWE booked a group of Indian performers to come out and perform a legitimate display of their culture while knowing it would get booed and even wanting it to get booed. Then they took it a step further. They had a nice lady sing the national anthem to a chorus of boos.\n\nAs a multi-million dollar company with distribution in many countries and considering the current sociopolitical climate that we are in, that is flat out irresponsible and wrong. Full stop.\n\nI've seen arguments that blame the crowd or say it isn't a big deal or that it's just entertainment ore even that Jinder's presentation has some subtext or nuance. I want address each of those. First, I want to say this: if this was one incident, I might be able to understand those arguments. But the reality is, throughout his entire run as champion, WWE has used his race and his culture as the basis for booing him. Mahal isn't the only one. Rusev and Kevin Owens alone on Smackdown this year since Wrestlemania have used the \"angry foreign Heel\" or some close variation. I just want to focus on Mahal because of the spotlight he has received the past three months.\n\nTwo nights after he won the title, WWE had another display of culture like the one on Tuesday which fed into a promo where Jinder said \"you people hate me because of my race\" like he always does. Except that crowd didn't boo, at least not like Tuesday's raining shower of dissatisfaction. Some people actually looked interested. Cageside's own recap from May 23rd said \"at least half the crowd watched the festivities, felt the beat, and celebrated with Mahal.\" Then for the next 3 months, WWE hammered us over the head with \"you hate me because of my race\" and Mahal using speaking Punjabi as a way to garner heat. As a result, the next time they had that display, (Tuesday) it was outrageously booed. Seriously. Compare the crowd reaction between the two segments. WWE spent 3 months getting the fans to hate Jinder because of his race and it led to people BOOING AN OLD LADY SINGING A NATIONAL ANTHEM. INTENTIONALLY. That's what WWE went for and it's what WWE got. And it sucks.\n\nFor those who say it isn't a big deal, here is why I disagree. Millions of people watch WWE in some form or fashion. WWE claims to be a PG, family friendly show. Children across the world watch. WWE spent 3 months telling them it's ok to boo because someone is different. That's wrong. An 8 year old watching this might now think it is ok to boo a legitimate display of culture by a group of people who are different because they dislike one person of that ethnicity. That is the message that was sent. That's absurd, especially with what happened America this past weekend\n\nHopefully, he or she has parents or friends that help him understand that's wrong. But kids today have so much access to everything that even 10 years ago didn't exist. Parents might not even know their child sees it. I have a 10 year old nephew who watches a ton of clips on YouTube without my sister knowing exactly which clips. I understand \"that's a parenting issue\" but here's the thing: my sister sets limits on when he can watch and what he can watch using parental control figures. WWE gets by those because it is \"PG\". My sister is aware of what he is doing and is involved in all parts of his life but she can't and shouldn't sit over his shoulder the whole time. So this is also a very real situation that kids are going through even if the parents are involved and care. And as a teacher and coach who has plied his career across 5 states, I can tell you that a ton of parents don't care that much. So when WWE teaches a lesson like they have with Mahal....it might stick. That's irresponsible of them.\n\nAlso, how must a child in India (or really any other country) feel watching this? Every week, Mahal goes out there and talks about loving his country and gets booed. Then brings people to show his culture....and gets booed. What message does that send about America? To every nation?\n\nFor those who say it's just entertainment, our entertainment IS our culture We are all a collection of the things we see and experience. WWE doesn't dictate how we act, just like video games in the 90s didn't cause everyone to be killers. But to ignore their impact and essentially brush them off is silly and, frankly, irresponsible. Like I said, kids watch the product. It unquestionably influences them. It doesn't cause action but it does plant thoughts and ideas. This planted the wrong idea.\n\nFor those who blame the crowd, I understand to an extent. The crowd shouldn't have booed. It was very disrespectful. However, the crowd was a symptom of the problem. Acting like the crowd is the main issue is ignoring the fact that WWE spent 3 months trying to get that exact reaction.\n\nFinally, for those who say Jinder has been presented as a liar using his race to escape consequences....I just don't agree that there has been enough of that. There have been a couple points, here and there, where someone like Orton has said \"they don't hate you because of your race, they hate you because you are an asshole.\" That's not commentary on Mahal's character, that's the standard WWE \"pop the crowd with our occasionally cuss word\" move that you get every time a character wants to call someone a \"bitch.\" It isn't about poking holes in his argument. It is literally only mean to be an insult in a highlight reel before they hit the slow motion into the big brawl with MichaelCole yelling \"oh my god, they're going at it!!\"\n\nFor the record, I was totally for putting the belt on Mahal at first. I was excited when he won #1 contender. I even defended it in comments a couple times. Mahal, in my opinion, has been fairly solid (if unspectacular) when given other material to work with (which mostly only happens in-ring). WWE may have boosted a \"jobber\" (hate that term) to champ but they did so in the most believable way possible. His character is clearly defined. He can't win a match without help at all, which is exactly what a \"jobber\" who ascends to the title should be like. He even knows he can't raise his in ring ability in a huge match like the Punjabi Prison....so he raised his cheating by bringing in the Great Khali (who immediately disappeared).\n\nIMO, the best segment Mahal has done was before he was champ when he stole the WWE championship and rode around in a limo acting like a grade A a-hole. Him flaunting the limo with a title he didn't even get the right way and doesn't deserve is worthy of my hate. That Jinder Mahal can get booed with a clear conscious. Not because he is Indian or Canadian or even because he's rich....but because he's rubbing in accomplishments he didn't earn. It would even be a nice change up for the Snobby Heel Gimmick, which other guys, like Miz (who has been around long enough to be believable) and Bobby Roode (who is dirty but doesn't get help), are also using. Another example is when he was in the Skybox watching Cena-Nakamura. He could have been partying or showing ANYTHING besides him just sitting there. He could've had a bunch of alcohol or food that most people couldn't afford. He could have had waiters asking him what he wanted and him being a jerk. He could've been putting down Cena or Nakamura. But he sat there and watched intensely, which, frankly, is exactly what I'd want any character to do. Am I supposed to boo just because he has a Skybox? He's the WWE champ scouting his competition! I totally understand not wanting to sit in the back and watch on a screen. Watching live is better and watching from the crowd wouldn't be realistic for WWE champ. I applaud WWE for trying something besides \"commentary\" but it didn't move the needle when it could have.\n\nThey also had other routes. Mahal also has great material when he talks about being overlooked, like in Atlanta on May 30th (Only remember because I was there). So there are facets to his character that could really work. WWE just chooses to spend more time on the angry foreigner. And for a company of their size, with their reach, to intentionally build to a point where an entire arena booed a lady simply for singing the song of her country only encourages more division.\n\nLook, I am normally the guy who backs WWE. I give things a chance, like this Mahal experiment at the start. I wrote a defense a while back defending Lana's face turn at the time it happened (WWE proved me wrong but I stand by that article at the time I wrote it). I haven't written Jason Jordan or Big Cass (ok, getting close here) off yet, even with their terrible themes and boring presentation thus far. I just can't defend anything about what has happened so far.And unfortunately, this is all just a bigger issue with WWE's inability, or rather lack of a desire to, present heel wrestlers with an accent as anything different from \"the Other\". (if you don't know what that means, please, look it up. That is a genuine request. It is important).\n\nThere is hope! I actually think Nakamura is the BEST choice to take the title off Jinder. I applaud WWE for not letting it be Cena because his 'I Love America\" routine (which I actually enjoy and love most of the time) would be the worst possible foil for Mahal. Nakamura, with his obvious struggles with English and being different, is great because he takes away the basis for Jinder's argument. If they had two more weeks to build that idea and use Nakamura to undermine the message Mahal had been spreading, I would be all in. I hope they do that when Mahal uses his \"rematch\" clause. As it is now, I am just relieved it looks like the time of the Maharaja is almost over.\n\nSo, Cagesiders. 1st, if you read all this way, thank you. 2nd,Thoughts? I fully welcome comments, even disagreements as long as everyone stays civil.

The past week has seen some interesting events go down including Akira Tozawa capturing Neville's WWE Cruiserweight Championship and Baron Corbin losing his Money in the Bank cash-in match. Now, the latest WWE rumors and spoilers are pointing towards at least two of the titles changing hands, but there's always the possibility for more. Here are the latest possible spoilers for who may walk away with a championship this weekend. WWE fans who want some potential surprises may want to avoid reading on.\n\nThere's a stacked card coming to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on Sunday. Among the biggest matches will be Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship, and Brock Lesnar defending the WWE Universal Championship in a Fatal 4-Way. According to WWE Leaks, Brock Lesnar appears to be safe to enter the arena as champion and leave as champion. He's held the title since WrestleMania 33 back in April. Now he puts it on the line against Samoa Joe, Braun Strowman, and Roman Reigns. Lesnar was a 4 to 11 favorite to retain as of Thursday morning.\n\nOdds were recently revealed for the WWE Raw tag team titles matchup as well. In that battle, it's former Shield brothers Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose teaming up to take on current champions Sheamus and Cesaro. The Irish sports book Paddy Power has the latest odds showing Rollins and Ambrose as 2 to 5 favorites to capture the tag team titles. For Rollins, it would make for his second reign with a tag team belt. For Ambrose, it would make his first. It would also make plenty of fans happy, although this could be a storyline headed for an Ambrose heel turn at some point.\n\nThe WWE Raw Women's Championship is a different story. Current champion Alexa Bliss is an 8 to 11 favorite. However, \"The Boss\" Sasha Banks is listed at \"even\" giving her a good chance at coming away with the title. Those odds could move significantly as the pay-per-view gets closer in favor of the current champion. Bliss has held the women's title for the \"red brand\" since 106 days now. Of note, she's a week away from breaking the longest reign for a Raw women's champion currently held by Charlotte Flair.\n\nIn what could be the biggest win of the night, Shinsuke Nakamura will take on Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship. It's Shinsuke's first crack at the title since arriving to the main roster. After this past Tuesday's failed cash-in by Baron Corbin, Nakamura seems like he could be in the clear to become the new champion with no worries over \"The Lone Wolf\" hitting him with a briefcase and taking away the title. Nakamura is listed as the 4 to 9 favorite, while Mahal is a 13 to 8 underdog. It seems the reign of the \"Modern Day Maharaja\" is coming to an end on Sunday and the \"King of Strong Style\" will walk away with the gold.\n\nKeep in mind that the betting odds are merely the current reflections of the betting markets.

The final WWE weekly broadcast before this Sunday's SummerSlam PPV, the second biggest show of the year. What does the SmackDown Live blue brand have planned to excite the base heading into a huge weekend in Brooklyn?\n\nWe've got two announced matches so far, one of which was originally thought to be the main event for SummerSlam. Additionally, we'll probably get a new twist in the ongoing AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens saga and a certain backstage segment that is always, well, hilarious.\n\nLet's get on with it. Here's what you can expect tonight on SmackDown Live.\n\nPreviousSlide 1/5Next The SummerSlam Main Event That Wasn't\n\nJohn Cena will take on WWE Champion Jinder Mahal in the main event, a bout that was just announced yesterday. This is a non-title match.\n\nHeading into the Cena vs. Shinsuke Nakamura number one contender's contest two weeks ago, there was a prevailing belief that John Cena was headed for a victory. The entire run of Jinder Mahal, that anti-American heel, holding the title belt seemed tailor made for John Cena to eventually come back, battle against, and emerge victorious at a big show like SummerSlam. Instead, WWE pivoted to the \"King of Strong Style\" and we will have to wait for Cena's eventual 17th title reign.\n\nSo look at tonight's match as a \"what could have been\" at SummerSlam. How will John and Jinder mesh in the ring? If Jinder hangs on to the title at SummerSlam, a distinct possibility, we could be getting Cena/Mahal again down the line for the title.\n\nPreviousSlide 2/5Next An Apology From The Phenomenal One?\n\nIn their official SmackDown preview, WWE is playing up that AJ Styles will be \"apologizing\" to Shane McMahon tonight on the show.\n\nWe will probably be treated to a segment similar to what we got last week with Styles, McMahon, and Owens in the ring. Last week, Owens brought up the rough history Styles and McMahon had, showing clips of their brawling backstage on SmackDown weeks ahead of their eventual bout at WrestleMania. Presumably, Styles will be apologizing for their past, which seems odd for a babyface so there's got to be some kind of twist for this. He will also, I would think, be apologizing for the pele kick from last Thursday.\n\nOwens also brought up Shane 'O Mac's checkered past last week when it comes to his roles as guest referee. With a week to think about that, how will McMahon further explain that he will be impartial this time around? And will we see Styles and Owens in competition after two weeks off wrestling on television?\n\nPreviousSlide 3/5Next Natalya Will Take On Becky Lynch\n\nFive days ahead of her championship showdown at SummerSlam with Naomi, Natalya will take on the competitor many thought would be in that title match, Becky Lynch.\n\nI must say that it has been a breath of fresh air to see Natalya thrown into the SmackDown women's title mix. The division had begun to be a bit stale, predictable, and repetitive. Natalya is arguably the most technically sound female on the roster, so she definitely deserves this spot to shine at the second biggest show of the year. Legitimately happy to see her get this opportunity after so many years of questionable direction for her character (and wasted potential, in my opinion).\n\nSo what will we see tonight? One would hope that Natalya would be portrayed strongly so that we can take her seriously as a contender heading into the big match this Sunday. Then again, Becky Lynch has been left floundering and could use a big win. This could really go either way.\n\nPreviousSlide 4/5Next The Final Edition Of Fashion Peaks\n\nWWE is advertising that this will be the final installment of Fashion Peaks. Sad!\n\nTyler Breeze and Fandango have been responsible for what have easily been the most entertaining backstage segments produced by WWE in quite some time. However, the search for \"Dango\" has ended and it's time to get these two back in the ring. How will they wrap things up tonight?\n\nWith last week's discovery that Arn Anderson was behind the destruction of Tully the Horse (what a great double entendre), not to mention Fandango's alien abduction story, I'm not quite sure what loose ends are left to tie up.\n\nPreviousSlide 5/5The Tamina/Lana Connection?\n\nLana's failures to get a victory week in and week out on SmackDown have been well documented. Last week, there was an interaction where Lana confessed to Tamina that she was her inspiration. She said she wanted to be just like Tamina, except more \"ravishing.\"\n\nAfter Lana's embarrassing loss to Charlotte, Tamina at first kind of rubbed it in. Then, she went on to talk about ambition being her driving force. She told Lana that she would help her find her ambition. Will that journey start tonight?\n\nI don't know about you, but I can't wait for the training montages featuring Lana and Tamina. Okay, I'm being a little sarcastic, but there's some potential for some entertaining television if they do this right. Just sub Tamina for Hulk and Lana for \"Mean\" Gene and this could be tremendous.\n\nStart Slideshow Back to Article Slide of\n\nby Ryan Droste | August 15, 2017", "id": "9402705", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "What To Expect On Tonight's WWE SmackDown Live", "image": "http://media.popculture.com/2017/08/johncenasdpreviewmahal-20009695-640x320.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 5129, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 5144}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "id": "303298", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "id": "304688", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

The event will be broadcast on pay-per-view and streamed on the WWE Network starting at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nHere are the top matches taking place at SummerSlam and our predicted winners:\n\nBrock Lesnar (champion) vs. Roman Regins vs. Samoa Joe vs. Braun Strowman in a Fatal 4-Way Match for the Universal Championship.\n\nThe most unpredictable of the matches taking place Sunday, each competitor has a fair chance at taking home Raw's top prize. Reigning champion Brock Lesnar and his advocate Paul Heyman have threatened in recent weeks to leave the WWE if The Beast loses due to the odds stacked against him. With Lesnar rumored to be headed back to the UFC for a potential fight against Jon Jones, a new champion will most likely be crowned here.\n\nDue to Samoa Joe's impressive display against Lesnar at Great Balls of Fire, The Destroyer barely edges out Reigns and Strowman as a potential winner who only needs to lock in his fabled Coquina Clutch submission maneuver onto any of the competitors to win the match.\n\nPredicted winner: Samoa Joe\n\nJinder Mahal (champion) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the WWE Championship\n\nDespite Shinsuke Nakamura's impressive win over John Cena recently to earn this championship match, the odds may prove too difficult for WWE's resident Rockstar to overcome as Jinder Mahal will once again be backed by his henchmen, The Singh Brothers. Always willing to do whatever it takes to win, including enlisting the help of past champions, Mahal will once again cheat his way to victory among a chorus of boos.\n\nPredicted winner: Jinder Mahal\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corbin\n\nCorbin will be out for blood Cena's blood since he ruined his chance at becoming WWE Champion Tuesday on Smackdown when he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. Cena, who has repeatedly embarrassed The Lone Wolf, keeps a busy schedule outside of WWE and may be headed toward another sabbatical. There is also the fact that Cena announced in July that he is a free agent able to compete on either Raw or Smackdown to consider as he may move onto the red brand in the near future to face new challengers. This makes Corbin the likely winner as WWE will want him to look strong as he attempts to climb back into the championship picture on Tuesday nights.\n\nPredicted winner: Baron Corbin\n\nAJ Styles (champion) vs. Kevin Owens for the United States Championship with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee\n\nA special guest referee always equals some type of shenanigans taking place in a match and this will be no different. Expect Shane McMahon to get involved physically in this bout and for the Smackdown commissioner to use his power in order to select and favor either AJ Styles or Kevin Owens to win the match. Destined to feud with the loser, and with McMahon having already faced Styles at WrestleMania, The Phenomenal One will win setting up a future confrontation between McMahon and Owens.\n\nPredicted winner: AJ Styles\n\nCesaro and Sheamus (champions) vs. Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins for the Raw Tag Team Championship\n\nThere is no stopping this Shield reunion between Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins that has been building up for weeks. The Hounds of Justice are back and will prove too formidable for Cesaro and Sheamus as WWE looks to bring back one the most popular factions of all time. With championship gold around their waist, perhaps afterwards Ambrose and Rollins will approach Roman Reigns about rejoining their ranks as well.\n\nPredicted winners: Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins\n\nNaomi (champion) vs. Natalya for the Smackdown Women's Championship\n\nNaomi's feel-good championship run shows no signs of slowing down and she has yet to face the other women present on the Smackdown roster making her the favorite to win. The most exciting thing about this match, however, is that Carmella will be waiting in the wings with her Money in the Bank briefcase. There is no better time than SummerSlam for The Princess of Staten Island to cash in on a depleted Naomi and become the new Smackdown Women's Champion.\n\nPredicted winner: Naomi, followed by Carmella cashing her Money in the Bank briefcase to become the new Smackdown Women's Champion\n\nAlexa Bliss (champion) vs. Sasha Banks for the Raw Women's Championship\n\nSasha Banks is acting as a replacement here for Bayley who has been forced to miss out on SummerSlam due to injury. This makes Alexa Bliss the easy favorite to win as she moves on to feud with Nia Jax who has remained in the championship picture.\n\nPredicted winner: Alexa Bliss\n\nFinn Balor vs. Bray Wyatt\n\nBray Wyatt has awakened Finn Balor's demon persona which will be out in full force at SummerSlam much to the Eater of Worlds' dismay. After losing to Wyatt recently on Raw, Balor will come out victorious at SummerSlam, however, Sunday will serve as just the latest chapter in this feud that will continue on for at least another month.\n\nPredicted winner: Finn Balor\n\nSummerSlam will also feature Smackdown Tag Team Champions The New Day defending their titles against The Usos; Randy Orton taking on Rusev; Big Show facing off against Big Cass with Enzo Amore suspended above the ring in a shark cage; Cruiserweight Champion Akira Tozawa defending his title against Neville; and The Hardy Boyz with Jason Jordan battling Intercontinental Champion The Miz and his Miztourage.\n\nThe writing is on the wall...\n\nDon't miss @WWE @SummerSlam, streaming LIVE THIS SUNDAY at 7e/4p only on @WWENetwork! #SummerSlam pic.twitter.com/0uyLJB1RF6 -- WWE (@WWE)\n\nAugust 17, 2017", "id": "9899390", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "WWE SummerSlam predictions: Who will win?", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9511503054087/2017/i/15030590282735/v2.1/WWE-SummerSlam-predictions-Who-will-win.jpg?lg=4", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 0, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 7}, {"textStart": 5736, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 5751}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "id": "307188", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

Still? But as millenials' biological need to be ensconced in nostalgia at every waking moment has intensified, so has the demand for the WWE. Revenue is up 10% year over year, WWE Network subscriptions have skyrocketed to well over 1.6 million, and total video across the brand's social media platforms recently eclipsed 4 billion (with a B). In other words, if you're NOT watching, you're the exception, not the rule.\n\nBut don't worry. The WWE's second biggest PPV event of the year may be mere days away, but we're here to help, getting you up to speed on everything you missed while you were busy being an adult for the past decade. So grab that fold-up chair and rub me down in baby oil, because it's time to send this one off the top rope.\n\nI think I remember SummerSlam as a trace element in the Mountain Dew/Halo/Cheeto dust swirl of my youth. Refresh my bong-fried memory again? SummerSlam is World Wrestling Entertainment's summer tentpole event which, if you can't guess by the name, features plenty of sweaty bedazzled man slamming in an arena full of other sweaty (significantly less bedazzled) men. To use a clunky every-sport analogy, if WrestleMania is WWE's Super Bowl -- and it is -- then SummerSlam is its Pro Bowl: Sunnier, funnier, and teeming with sentient muscle balls wearing Hawaiian shirts like they hoped they were going to be the only one to think of that.\n\nBoy, what a glowing endorsement. Maybe I'll just watch Thrones instead... Well, actually, if you like Game of Thrones, there's plenty of demo crossover here. 2016 SummerSlam breakthrough, Finn B\u00e1lor -- who's been out for almost a year following a shoulder injury sustained in last year's inaugural Universal Belt bout -- is set to revive his dormant \"Demon King\" shtick for a grudge match with Bray Wyatt. Meanwhile, Brock Lesnar is pretty much The Mountain. Sure, there are no dragons, but it can't be Christmas every day either.\n\nIf you watch 60 Minutes on Sunday nights and fancy yourself a Serious Person\u2122, however, I strongly suggest you have a few beers before attempting to turn into the spin. I'm a miserable, dignified f -- k too, but if you give it a chance, you'll be amazed what watching a bunch of pleather panty-clad women (or men, whatever works for you) beat the shit out of each other on live TV can do for your mental health.\n\nDid someone say pleather panties? OK, I'm in. So what are the major storylines I should, uhh, buff up on? As always, it's all about Brock Lesnar. The only dude to ever successfully crossover from sports entertainment to actual sports (and back again) has been setting up a return to UFC for several months, and SummerSlam looks like it could finally be the catalyst. Lesnar will be competing in a Fatal 4-Way --\n\nWait, wait, wait: Fatal 4-Way? A four-hulk free-for-all. No teams, no rules, just right.\n\nOK, go on... against fellow prehistoric rock monsters Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman in a battle to retain the Universal Championship (don't ask, we doubt even Vince McMahon could explain it). Due to the \"random\" (and by random we mean obsessively scripted) nature of the Fatal 4-Way, however, Lesnar's sideshow manager, Paul Heyman, has already gone on record saying that if Lesnar loses the belt, he will walk away from the WWE.\n\nExpect Lesnar to lose the belt.\n\nThat's not the only match though right? Not. Even. Close. In addition to a full slate of Saturday action from the WWE's increasingly popular feeder league, NXT, the main SummerSlam fight card also includes New Japan Wrestling sensation Shinsuke Nakamura -- think Thriller-era Michael Jackson crossed with the Drunken Master -- battling Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship, Alexa Bliss and Sasha Banks facing off for the incrementally de-sexualized Raw Women's Championship, and midtown-Irish-pub-level parody Sheamus teaming up with Cesaro to fend off white trash heartthrob, Dean Ambrose, and reformed dick-pic-er, Seth Rollins, for the Raw Tag Team Championship.\n\nSounds like my family reunion... ZING! And as if that wasn't enough speedo-and-bondage-boot action for you and your suddenly interested girlfriend, John Cena -- who you've probably actually heard of -- is set to wrestle Baron Corbin, while fan favorites AJ Styles and Kevin Owens will fake-punch it out for the United States Championship, with the comish's son, Shane McMahon, serving as the guest referee. Shane is best known for his death-defying leaps in and around the ring (and for surviving a recent helicopter crash), though, so expect him to male-stripper tear his too-small zebra stripes off and flatten someone like an asphalt roller at some point. Hell, maybe he'll even win the belt. Who knows, sometimes I swear they make this shit up as they go.\n\nThat's a lot to process, even if you are one of the 12 college-educated viewers. Any tips on who to root for? Sure. Maybe these pocket bios will help.\n\nAny other insider advice? Yeah, make sure to load up on snacks -- anything with \"nacho\" flavoring will do -- and cardboard vats of fried chicken, if readily available in your area of West Virginia. SummerSlam is like seven grueling hours of all America, all the time, and you'll need to periodically refuel if you want to have anything left for that Monster Truck rally tomorrow.\n\nAlso, try not to mention it in front of your office IT guy, unless you want to spend half the morning searching your desk for something stab into your earholes while he grandstands about The Miz's inauthentic ego-worship, only to realize you loaned your scissors to Steve last week and this is your fate now, you stupid, stupid idiot.\n\nSo say I hypothetically wanted to watch this thing, you know, as a sociological experiment or whatever, how would I do it? Well, if it's an immersive societal examination you're after, head on down to Barclays Center on Sunday night, where half of Pennsylvania, some of New Jersey, and most of Long Island will be found in a state of mutually suspended reality.\n\nIf you'd prefer a nostalgia experience far from the prying eyes of anyone you'll ever have to see again in your entire life, however, then pay-per-view or a WWE Network subscription (boy, you really got into this, huh?) should do the trick.

His supporters steadfastly defend him; his detractors boo him mercilessly.\n\nAnd if his latest crowning moment happens inside the Barclays Center, WWE won't be happy with the reaction.\n\nFor one, Brooklyn, New York, is a fanbase heavy with \"smarks,\" the same diehard portion of the audience that has pushed back against Reigns' rise. Like Chicago, Philadelphia and Toronto, the Brooklyn crowd is often outspoken, favors internet darlings and has seemingly made a sport of booing Reigns.\n\nWhen Raw traveled to the Barclays Center last August, the fans treated The Big Dog like the heel despite him going up against the conniving, villainous Chris Jericho.\n\nReigns bowled over Jericho with a shoulder block and boos rained down. Jericho locked his foe in the Walls of Jericho and the crowd roared in approval.\n\nAgainst Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe at SummerSlam, Reigns can expect the same treatment.\n\nA good number of fans will be rooting for Joe and Strowman to emerge with the universal title in hand. Joe's lengthy journey to this point, through Ring of Honor, TNA and Japan, makes him easy to pull for. He has immense street cred, so to speak, with diehard fans.\n\nThe hosts of the Tights and Fights podcast are clearly behind Joe:\n\nAnd they aren't alone. Corey Jacobs of WrestlingNews.co wrote an article entitled \"It's Time for WWE to Put the Universal Championship on Samoa Joe.\" Daily DDT's Alexander Podgorski posted five reasons Joe should win on Sunday.\n\nThere's a similar push for Strowman to take the crown.\n\nHis destructive ways on Raw have endeared him to fans in a big way. He's become the red brand's monstrous anti-hero.\n\nThe Busted Open Twitter account noted back in July that Strowman had strong support in a fan poll about who they wanted to be champ:\n\nThere is not that same mindset for Reigns. The Big Dog has already been world champ three times while Joe and Strowman are fresher faces to the title scene.\n\nReigns outlasting Strowman, Joe and Lesnar at SummerSlam will result in audible disappointment from the Barclays Center crowd. His moment of glory will be overshadowed by the audience's vehement pushback, a jarring scene reminiscent of Reigns' wins at Royal Rumble 2015 and WrestleMania 32.", "id": "9806498", "details": {},

Twelve months on and not only is the 29 year-old one of SmackDown's premier talents, but she's also walking around with a guaranteed title shot thanks to her history-making Money In The Bank victory.\n\nYes, that win may have been surrounded in controversy, but it marked the crescendo to a year that's seen the Princess of Staten Island go from tag team valet in NXT to being one pin away from winning WWE gold. Next up for Carmella is Sunday's massive SummerSlam event, but before she sets her sights on a cash-in on either Natalya or SmackDown Champ Namoi, Miss Money In The Bank spoke to Gorilla Position about her rise to the top of the blue brand's women's division.\n\nCarmella great to talk to you, before we talk SummerSlam lets take you back to Money In The Bank. What were your feelings both going into the match and the subsequent controversial victory?\n\nWhen I first found out that we were having a ladder match I was a little scared. I'm kind of a small girl so I was a little nervous about jumping of ladders and taking big falls, but I persevered and not only did I get to be part of the match but I got to be the winner - not once but twice. It was exciting, fun and scary all rolled into one. It was the best feeling ever, and I've loved shoving in everyone's face that didn't believe in me, everyone who told me I would never do anything in WWE other than a cheerleader. It really cemented myself in the history books, and whatever happens from now on I'll always be Miss Money In The Bank. It was a really satisfying moment\n\nSome have said it may have been a little early in your career, especially given the caliber of talent in that match. What do you say to that?\n\nThis is only the beginning of my career. I know I'm not Charlotte Flair, I'm not Becky Lynch, I'm not Sasha Banks, but you know what? I don't really care because I'm Carmella. I don't want to be like anyone else, I'm me and I'm the best version of myself I can be. You can compare me to those as much as you want but I'm here to make history. Are any of those girls Miss Money In The Bank? No, but I am.\n\nThe win marked an incredible twelve months for you, how have you enjoyed the past year on SmackDown Live?\n\nWhat a year for the SmackDown's women's division and for me personally, I can't believe what we've done. The girls main evented SmackDown with a cage match, we had the first ever women's Money In The Bank match and the No DQ match I had with Nikki Bella. If you would have asked me this time last year all of the things that would happen I wouldn't have believed you, but it's happening and we're making history. I'm the first ever two-time Miss Money In The Bank, I've been able to have matches with some incredible talent, it's like a dream come true.\n\nAnd what role do you contribute to James Ellsworth as part of the Carmella package?\n\nHe's the man, he's a really good friend of mine and because of him I'm at where I'm at, because of our friendship. I don't think anyone saw me being with James Ellsworth coming, but it got people talking and its different, you really see a women with a male manager. I really enjoyed the controversy around the Money In The Bank Ladder Match because everyone was so upset about, and I loved it. It's been a lot of fun and I think we make a great team.\n\nThat team is now headed for SummerSlam, how much are you looking forward to the event are there any plans to put the briefcase on the line?\n\nI can't wait for SummerSlam and especially as its in New York, which is always very special. Summertime in New York is always a lot of fun and I can't wait for my second SummerSlam. At the moment my plan is to hold onto the contract as long as I can. I'm messing with Naomi right now because she has the title, but who knows how long she'll have that and maybe I'll cash it in soon or maybe I wont. I like to catch whoever it will be off-guard, so I'm not going to reveal my plans just yet.\n\nSummerSlam weekend also sees NXT host TakeOver: Brooklyn III. It must seem like a different world to you now, seeing as in your NXT days you were seen as more of a manager rather than an in-ring talent?\n\nI feel like someone should pinch me because it doesn't feel real. When I was with the boys (Enzo and Big Cass) I was just a valet and I was having a blast, but I couldn't help wonder when it was my time to show what I'd been working on for the past few years. I did what I had to do, and I wouldn't take it back for anything, but I'm so happy where I'm at right now. Especially with the women's revolution going on, it's good to be part of that and make history. All of these women I get to work with everyday are working really, really hard to get where we're at and I'm excited to see what the future holds for all of us.\n\nBefore we look to the future, can we ask about your past and your father who was a wrestler in the early 90s. Does that mean you were surrounded by wrestling at an early age?\n\nYeah I used to watch with him and dress-up in my old dance costumes. He would carry me on his shoulder everywhere like Miss Elizabeth, going into the kitchen to see my Mum and sister. It meant he worked nights a lot, so we would record Raw on our VCR and then watch it the next day when I got home from school. I did grow up watching it a lot and my Dad was in a couple of wrestling magazines that I would take to school, so I was definitely was the coolest third grader in school.\n\nMiss Elizabeth isn't a name we here often these days, was she someone you liked watching?\n\nApart from the Trish Stratus' and the Lita's, she's someone who I did really look up to growing up. Even though she wasn't a wrestler, there was something about her. She was so fabulous, so classy and carried herself in a way I really admired. I loved watching her.\n\nFinally and getting back to the present, after the incredible rise you've had in WWE what's next for you and women's wrestling?\n\nI feel like the sky is the limit right now for women's wrestling. I think all of us would agree that the next step would be to main event WrestleMania that would be incredible.

At one point in the match, Seth performed a running powerbomb and slammed Finn into the safety barrier outside the ring, and disaster struck.\n\nFinn suffered a 180 degree labrum tear, a torn bicep and pectoral tendon, cartilage damage and a fracture to the glenoid neck socket.\n\nThis wasn't enough to thwart The Demon King, however, as he went to defeat Seth Rollins with his patented Coup De Grace and became the first ever WWE Universal Champion.\n\nHe also became the first ever Superstar to relinquish the Title, as his injuries were too severe to continue in the ring for several months.\n\nBalor is currently on the road back to the top, most recently ending his rivalry with Elias and is now in the midst of mind games with The Eater of Worlds, Bray Wyatt, who he faces this Sunday at SummerSlam.\n\nBrock Lesnar was the specimen that blasted on the scene in 2002, attacking Al Snow, Maven and Spike Dudley, with the latter being on the receiving end of a devastating triple powerbomb. And who was by his side? None other than The Advocate, Paul Heyman, who was seen barking orders.\n\nAt the time, Brock was nicknamed \"The Next Big Thing\", and boy were they right. His first feud was with The Hardy Boyz, defeating them at multiple PPVs including Backlash and Judgement Day.\n\nAfter winning the King of the Ring final against RVD, Brock earned his WWE Undisputed Championship shot against The Rock at SummerSlam 2002. Brock executed his own Rock Bottom and F5, and with the help of an interference from Paul Heyman, he landed the big time and won his first championship.\n\nBrock began to make an even bigger name for himself as he went to war with The Undertaker at No Mercy, defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match.\n\nWe all know how The Deadman and The Beast's rivalry progressed in the future.\n\nLesnar went on to feud with Big Show, the feud that led Paul Heyman to betray him. Lesnar would suffer his first pin fall loss to Show at Survivor Series, which catapulted his reputation with the fans, and went on to do great things with the company.\n\nKurt Angle's first appearance at WWE came in 1999, quickly establishing his American Hero character based on his gold medal win at the 1998 Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter his initial stint as a \"good guy\", fans quickly began to boo his entrances, which Kurt quickly capitalised on and turned into a villain, patronising his fellow Superstars and the audience themselves.\n\nJust a year later, Angle won the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and then losing both titles without ever conceding a fall in a two-pin Triple Threat match at WrestleMania 2000.\n\nWith these two Titles a distant memory, he then became a top-tier Superstar, feuding with The Rock and Triple H which led to a Triple Threat Match at SummerSlam. Angle was stretchered out during the match after a Pedigree through the announcement table.\n\nAs The People's Champion and The King of Kings battled on, Kurt would be brought back in alongside Vince McMahon to take on Triple H, but after a tussle between The Game and Kurt over a sledgehammer, Vince was on the receiving end of a bash.\n\nWith Kurt and Triple H distracted, the Rock threw the American Hero over the ropes, and then pinned The Game after dishing out The People's Elbow.\n\nSummerSlam would be the catalyst to spark his career. He would go on to have a heated rivalry with Triple H, with Kurt frequently interfering in The Game's matches and ruining his title opportunities.\n\nThey'd go on to do battle a week before Unforgiven, as Angle attacked Triple H with a sledgehammer, leading to the American Hero kissing Stephanie McMahon as her husband lay unconscious in the ring.\n\nTriple H earned vengeance at Unforgiven, but Kurt would go on to have one of the greatest rivalries in recent memories against Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nSummerSlam 1998 was nicknamed \"Highway to Hell\", with a fierce main card on the table. Stone Cold was due to defend his title against The Undertaker, Ken Shamrock had a huge bout with Owen Hart, and X-Pac battled Jeff Jarret, but it was the two young guns that stole the show - The Rock and Triple H.\n\nThe two up and coming Superstars faced off in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title, with carnage ensuing. After weaponising the ladder to both their advantages, Chyna delivered a low blow to The Rock which allowed HHH to win the Intercontinental Title.\n\nUnfortunately, Triple H would be sidelined with a knee injury and gave up the title, but while he was away The Rock went on to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series.\n\nThe two would reignite their rivalry in an I Quit match, The Rock accompanied by Kane and The Game by Chyna. Much to Triple H's dismay, he was forced to say I Quit to stop Kane chokeslamming Chyna.\n\nHowever, Chyna later attacked Triple H, showing that she planned to betray him all along.\n\nThe Game would then go on to have one of his most memorable heel turns, and become a part of The Corporation.\n\nDaniel Bryan is the Rocky of the WWE Universe - the true underdog story that everyone wanted to succeed. His unconventional looks, his smaller frame, his wild facial hair, it was everything that the WWE hadn't seen in a Title contender before. But nobody resonated with the fans better than the do-or-die Daniel Bryan.\n\nBefore SummerSlam 2013, the Team Hell No tag-team was formed of Bryan and Kane, where they would often bicker between themselves during matches. They would go on to have a successful run as WWE Tag Team Champions, feuding with the likes of Team Rhodes Scholars, 3MB and, later down the line, The Shield, who they lost the titles to.\n\nBryan became obsessed to prove he wasn't the weak link of Team Hell No and launched the \"Yes!' movement, becoming more aggressive in the process.\n\nThis was the year he began to become the Superstar that put his name in lights. After Team Hell No separated, Bryan went on to better Randy Orton in a rivalry, and continued his hot streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian.\n\nThe crowd was pining for Bryan to win the Money in the Bank that year, but was foiled by Curtis Axel, a non-participant, with Randy Orton picking up the win.\n\nHowever, the crowd would have their dreams come true as John Cena picked Bryan to be his opponent at SummerSlam 2013. This is where The Corporation began to dampen any hopes Bryan would have at victory by psychologically and physically damaging him. Bryan was labelled the 'B+ Player', he was put through gauntlet matches, and was made to face his old tag-team partner Kane.\n\nNone of that mattered, as Cena and Bryan went hammer and tong, as the Yes Man beat the odds to become the WWE Champion. Special referee Triple H, however, had other plans, and planted a Pedigree to Bryan. Orton would cash in his Money in the Bank and cut the title reign short.\n\nSummerSlam would further propel his connection with the crowd, and went on to create the biggest atmospheres in stadiums across the world from his matches - he'd feud with The Corporation, Randy Orton, and the up and coming Bray Wyatt.\n\nBryan would go on to main event WrestleMania XXX, defeating Batista and Randy Orton in a Triple Threat Match to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion.", "id": "9795420", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "With SummerSlam just round the corner, we look at some of

As any wrestling fan knows, Cena's movie and television commitments have limited his appearances on SmackDown over the past couple of years. Cena returned to the ring at the 2017 Royal Rumble, where a fantastic match with AJ Styles saw him equal Ric Flair's record of 16 championship titles.\n\nCena has long been proclaimed as \"the face who runs the place\" on SmackDown, so it was easy to assume that Cena's latest return would see him eclipse Flair's record. The reality has been very different. Setting aside Cena's tag team appearance at WrestleMania 33, we have seen Cena suffer a string of defeats.\n\nWhen Cena returned to SmackDown, on August 1, to face Shinsuke Nakamura, few expected Nakamura to win the right to challenge Jinder Mahal, for the WWE Championship, at this weekend's SummerSlam PPV. Having lost to Nakamura, Cena will now face Baron Corbin at SummerSlam. As reported on the official WWE website, a feud is brewing between Cena and Corbin, and it seems that the WWE is using Cena to provide a push to emerging stars.\n\nAs reported by Blasting News, tonight's SmackDown Live will see Cena taking on WWE Champion Jinder Mahal, in a non-title match, just five-days before SummerSlam.\n\nAfter the retirement of The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33, Cena is arguably the WWE's biggest draw. With so many huge WWE names either retired or very infrequent competitors, it makes sense to use Cena to boost the profile of emerging stars. If Sportskeeda is to be believed, Cena's \"free agent\" status affords him the opportunity to appear on both SmackDown and Monday Night Raw.\n\nThey report that Cena is advertised to face Samoa Joe, another newcomer, on the September 4 episode of Monday Night Raw, and that all of Cena's appearances between SummerSlam and the No Mercy PPV are on Raw. If those claims prove to be true we can expect Cena to face Samoa Joe, Braun Strowman, and Roman Reigns, all of whom are being pushed by the WWE.\n\nInterestingly, Give Me Sport was predicting a John Cena vs. Samoa Joe feud before the Samoan even joined the main roster. It makes sense for the WWE to use Cena in this way. If you want to push relatively new talent, there is no better way than to pitch them against the biggest names in wrestling. It seems that John Cena may be ushering in a new age in WWE wrestling.

Tonight, the circumstances will be similar, except the Modern Day Maharajah will do battle with someone he's never dealt with one-on-one before, and his name is...\n\nJohn Cena is plowing through \"first time ever\" pairings on SmackDown. It's almost like the Free Agent is headed somewhere else after this weekend's pay-per-view (PPV). This match might have happened in Barclays Center this weekend as a chance for Cena to break Ric Flair's record of 16 WWE-recognized World titles, but he lost to another man he'd never wrestled before, Shinsuke Nakamura, will that on the line.\n\nMahal was beaten by Randy Orton last week, so whoever takes the fall here would go into The Biggest Party of the Summer on a losing streak. Unless of course...\n\nTo the surprise of many, including yours truly, Creative didn't use run-ins from guys in another feud to turn last week's main event into a tag team. But I think that just increases the likelihood the ghost of Teddy Long* appears in Rhode Island tonight after Baron Corbin attacks his SummerSlam opponent, and #1 contender Nakamura makes the save.\n\nIf Mahal trusts The Lone Wolf to watch his back, considering he has a breifcase containing an anytime, anywhere title shot in his possession, that is.\n\n* Teddy Long is alive and well.\n\nWhile special referee (and SmackDown commissioner) Shane McMahon was explaining the rules of engagement for the latest battle in the controversial feud between United States titleholder AJ Styles and Kevin Owens, The Phenomenal One Pele Kicked his WrestleMania opponent. Perhaps because of the respect they gained for one another in that bout, or maybe because the champ wants to make sure Shane's still gonna call things down the middle on Sunday, AJ is going to apologize to the commish tonight.\n\nBecky Lynch didn't make it on to the SummerSlam card, but she'll get a chance to factor into the Women's championship picture when she wrestles Naomi's #1 contender Natalya in Providence.\n\nTag champs The New Day have had enough. Since losing the straps, Jimmy and Jey Uso have mocked and attacked the trio at every turn. But last week, after a win over the plucky underdog team of Sami Zayn and Tye Dillinger, Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods struck back. The Usos escaped before taking any lasting damage, but they might be the ones who are paranoid now.\n\n- Fandango pulled himself away from some enjoyable alien probing long enough to learn that Arn Anderson destroyed his beloved horse Tully. In their final trip to \"Fashion Peaks\", can he help Tyler Breeze learn who keeps trashing the Fashion Police offices?\n\n- He didn't get his WWE title back, but Randy Orton did earn a win for America when he RKO-ed the champ last week. But another foreigner took him out to close the show, so how will The Viper look to get the upperhand heading into his PPV bout with Rusev?\n\n- They're reunited, but they're still not that smart. James Ellsworth returned from suspension to help Carmella defeat Naomi, but the the champion laid out, Ms. Money in the Bank opted not to cash-in. Let's hope she has a better plan for SummerSlam.\n\n- Lana's good at ambition, so Tamina's going to leverage that to get herself a title show as soon as possible.\n\n- She'll probably be in Atlanta, but let's keep Charlotte Flair, her father Ric and their whole family in our thoughts.", "id": "9297259", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "WWE SmackDown Live preview: Playing out the string", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHbzn6W8ddbqZg9ITBL57VbPzRE=/0x0:1600x900/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56199273/20170808_sd_cena__74c64328289243d5fedc1c146d6db1f5.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Providence"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "223175", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island", "label": {"eng": "Providence"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "223181", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island", "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "id": "304688", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

This means WWE had a massive 13 matches scheduled for the show, which seems a bit heavy.\n\nCandidates to join both confirmed matches on the Kickoff show include Naomi vs. Natalya, Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks or Randy Orton vs. Rusev.", "id": "9806513", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "WWE Confirms Another Match For SummerSlam 2017's Kickoff Show", "image": "https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2017/08/a6ea4c778461be37-600x400.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "37", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "House show"}, "id": "306428", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_show"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "id": "315017", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "id": "326957", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "id": "328739", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "id": "332491", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "id": "332492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "id": "340551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Usos"}, "id": "349174", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Usos"}, {"label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "351140", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "358623", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Akira Tozawa"}, "id": "383376", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Tozawa"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Hardy Boyz"}, "id": "577540", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_Boyz"}, {"label": {"eng": "WWE Cruiserweight Championship"}, "id": "692291", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Cruiserweight_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "The New Day (wrestling)"}, "id": "1273356", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Day_(wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scott Dawson (wrestler)"}, "id": "1283641", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Dawson_(wrestler)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dash Wilder"}, "id": "1396128", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_Wilder"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism"}], "time": "14:29:00"}

This goes for things both big and small, because at our core, because we're human, we're always searching for reasons for why things happen. When something bad happens to someone, we like to assume that they did something to deserve it, that something they did must have caused it, because the alternative is to say that bad things happen to good people, and that there is no such thing as control over anything. We like to assume that, if we see something happening, that there is some kind of logical reason for it to be happening, that there is so deeper meaning or explanation for what we are seeing beyond random chance.\n\nThis is as true for Pro Wrestling as is it is in anything else. We, as fans, love to hear about backstage gossip, love hearing about who is being pushed, who is being punished, who has heat and who is in the bosses good graces, who's got the backing of management and who pissed them off. We do this, ostensibly, because it is meant to give some form of context for what we see on our tv screens. When we see Jinder Mahal becoming champion out of nowhere, we go to the rumor mill to be told that it's because WWE is trying to break into the Indian market. When we see Jason Jordan being outed as Kurt Angle's long lost son, we assume that means he's going to be in line for a push because management sees something in him. When a tag team breaks up, we assume it's because there is something waiting for one or both of the individuals in that tag team.\n\nHowever, it's time to stop pretending. It's time to call a spade a spade. There is no plan, there is no goal, there's no greater thing at work here; if the Network Era should tell us anything, it's that everything we are seeing is the result of random ideas thrown at a wall week in and week out. There is no goal, no plan, no ideas behind any action that WWE makes; it is making these actions for the sake of making them at all.\n\nThe WWE Network has created a system where, in order to justify itself, content must be created for it. This means that it must constantly create 'moment's wherein things happen that WWE can point to. For example, the New Day broke Demolition's tag record. Why? Because WWE needed something to break, some record to be made, some moment to happen, before they were unceremoniously shunted off to the side.\n\nTake Jason Jordan being Kurt Angle's son. There is no plan for this. There is no goal. I read recently by own commenter that Jason Jordan is some secret Rocky Mavia 2.0 plan where they're going to convince the audience to hate him before turning him heel and making him a breakout star. The truth is, there is no such plan. There is no goal. WWE made a mystery about Kurt Angle because they needed to fill time, because they needed to create content for the sake of creating content, and produced Jason Jordan because he's unknown enough and unimportant enough that he won't damage WWE at all when they predictably put him where Curtis Axel currently is. In fact, he's basically in the same position, being touted as the next big thing, and we all know where this ends: in the undercard wrestling on Superstars. Make no mistake, Jordan wasn't chosen because he's some great talent, or because they had any story to tell. He was chosen because WWE needs to make content, and it doesn't matter what content they make, so long as the content is created.\n\nTake Baron Corbin's failed Money in the Bank cash in. What was the purpose of him winning? There was no purpose. The truth is, because WWE had a PPV called 'money in the bank' they were required to give those briefcases to someone and so they put it on Corbin and had him do nothing with it, and them threw it all away the week before a PPV because they had no other idea of what would be a good 'moment' to hype a Corbin vs Cena feud. Because there is no plan. There is go 'goal.' No one is being put to get 'over.' No one is being 'buried.' All of this would require planning and forethought, of which there is none. Corbin was given the briefcase because he's a warm body on the roster, and they threw it away because the idea of 'storytelling' or 'plot' means nothing in WWE. WWE creates content to justify their making of content; it is entirely separate from the concepts of 'demand' or 'popularity.' When WWE has conference calls, and they say they've made more content than ever before, that's the entire selling point. It doesn't matter that the content isn't entirely wanted or needed, the fact is they need to make it to justify their own existence, and the existence of their Network. It's like a restaurant that makes terrible food, but produces way too much of it, because the only selling point they have is that they produce so much. Rather than make anything of substance, they'd rather just try and overwhelm people and justify their prices by churning out the cheapest things possible in the largest quantities possible.\n\nIt's why we suddenly have Bray Wyatt throwing blood on Finn Balor a week before a PPV, because they couldn't think of a reason other than that for why he might wear the facepaint, that thing that sells merchandise, for one of their biggest shows of the year. It's why when there was a Women's Money in the Bank match, it was won by a man, because it allowed them to fill time on a random Smackdown by having another match. It's why Lana is a wrestler, and is now somehow managing another wrestler, despite the fact that they are both failures, because WWE needs a reason to have warm bodies on the roster. It's why Cena is a free agent for no reason, why AJ Styles is playing second fiddles as champion for a Kevin Owens/Shane McMahon feud, why Bayley defeated Charlotte a month before Wrestlemania, why despite the fact that Roman Reigns and Samoa Joe are a part of a championship match on Sunday they are wholly ignored in favor of Brock Lesnar and Braun Strowman.\n\nThings happen in WWE for the sake of things happening. They exist solely so WWE has something to put on their youtube channel and on the WWE Network. There is no great significance or any reasoning behind any title changes or any booking decisions. Everything that is done is being done because it is something to do, because there are bodies on the roster with pulses, and they need to be doing something to justify them being employed. WWE may tout that their current roster is the most talented roster in history, but it's also the most useless roster in history, and if you removed half of them you'd produce content of equal value, because the only reason for any one person to exist is only so they can create more content for content's sake.\n\nAt this point, the only slogan the WWE needs is: Abandon Hope, All Ye Who Enter Here.", "id": "9413068", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Calling a Spade a Spade", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/blog/sbnu_logo_minimal/244/large_cagesideseats.com.minimal.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "A.J.

And will it end the show?\n\nLost in the background of what is going to be a titanic collision between four enormous men over the Universal title, Jinder Mahal is putting his WWE championship on the line against Shinsuke Nakamura. There isn't much of a \"rivalry\" going on, except for the fact the belt is on the line and one man owns it, while another wants it.\n\nThe justifications for making it the main event are few and far between. The only logical way in which it's the last match to come on is if Nakamura wins the title for the first time, a moment worthy of all the revelry that would come alongside it. Arguably the top babyface in the company alongside AJ Styles, Nakamura is overwhelmingly loved by the fan base, which would allow for a mega celebration as the show closes; a moment worthy of coronation.\n\nUnless, of course, Baron Corbin's title reign begins. It would seem to be an awful quick turnaround from Money in the Bank for Corbin to springboard into the title picture, but there could be no more dastardly heel tactic than cashing in the contract after Nakamura's first title win, especially considering the history and the unfinished business the two men have.\n\nWhat seemingly won't happen is Mahal defying the odds and retaining his belt yet again. That would mean a new WWE champion is in store, it just comes down to whether or not they'll get the rub of ending the show.\n\nWhy did Randy Orton pin Jinder Mahal clean on SmackDown Live?\n\nWhile on the topic of Mahal, it's fair to ask why he was pinned in the center of the ring by Randy Orton last week on television. For three main event matches that spanned over two months and over an hour of WWE programming in total, Mahal avoided being struck by the Viper. Then, for some reason, he was pinned in their fourth encounter, giving Orton a rub he in no way needs.\n\nFirst, it's fair to wonder why this match took place at all. After losing the belt because of interference by the Singh Brothers, Orton got a rematch at Battleground. Then at Battleground, The Great Khali popped up to help Mahal retain. Logically, if we're following the storyline, Orton should still be on a vengeful warpath, not merely content to fight Rusev at SummerSlam and satisfied with a non-title victory over Mahal.\n\nMahal is heading into the biggest defense of his reign against Nakamura on Sunday and he needs every shred of momentum he can muster. The last thing he needs is to be pinned clean and lose credibility because he's likely to be grasping for that after his title reign.\n\nIs this the last week without Asuka on the main roster?\n\nOne of the odds-on favorites to be called up to the main roster following WrestleMania, Asuka has stuck around at NXT. Besides a strong Last Woman Standing match against Nikki Cross, Asuka has done ... not a whole lot in the additional four months she has been kept there.\n\nAsuka exists at NXT with the curse of being too good for the division around her. The gap between her and the rest of the roster is large, despite Ember Moon's talent level. Asuka's undefeated streak has reached iconic proportions and giving Moon a boost by having her snap it would be a way out.\n\nWhether or not Asuka drops the belt on Saturday at TakeOver: Brooklyn III, one of the women's divisions desperately needs her. SmackDown Live seems to be the conventional thought, although with the recent loss of Bayley, Raw might command her services.\n\nWe are yet to have a storyline in which an NXT champion operates on the main roster. Her gimmick could be that she's too unbeatable for anyone down at NXT, and she could continue to carry the strap, making sporadic appearances when necessary. Or, she could lose to Moon on Saturday and make the decision real simple. Either way, Asuka is coming.\n\nWhat does Goldust have up his sleeve next?\n\nIt's 2017 and Goldust is still appearing on weekly WWE television. For weeks, he traded barbs with R-Truth in what seemed like a feud that could materialize into something, yet it never even made it onto a single-brand PPV.\n\nNow, Goldust claims a next chapter in his downright creepy rebirth. Yippee. Is he managing someone? Is he targeting someone? Does anyone care?\n\nWhat's up with the lack of insight on the upcoming PPV schedule?\n\nLess than a week before SummerSlam, taking a look forward to the second half of the year is a pretty difficult task. As of now, just three single-brand PPV's have been announced: Sept. 24 Raw will host No Mercy, Oct. 8 SmackDown will host Hell in a Cell and Oct. 22 Raw will host TLC. Of course, Survivor Series is there as well, but that's still just four shows for the remainder of the year.\n\nThere will certainly be December events added, but it does seem strange that if SmackDown were to get another single-branded show in the weeks after SummerSlam, it hasn't been announced. After the debacle that was Battleground, going over two months and allowing Hell in a Cell to build could be the best thing possible for the show.\n\nLast year, each brand got three shows of their own after SummerSlam. It seems plausible that they could pack events in near December-January for more hype around the Royal Rumble, but as of now, it's all a mystery.\n\nRelated Items:WWE", "id": "9424389", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "Dear WWE | Is it Nakamura or Corbin's time at SummerSlam?", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/04053956/AP_891346198509.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 4489, "date": "2017-09-24", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4497}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 4522, "date": "2017-10-08", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4528}, {"textStart": 4568, "date": "-10-22", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4575}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "id": "304688", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

Some of the matches on August 20 look like heavy-hitters (AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee, anyone?), but others just feel uninspiring. Seriously, is it really necessary to have this much filler?\n\nSummerSlam is supposed to be one of WWE's biggest shows of the year, and yet the build hasn't reflected that status. It wasn't until this past Monday that the Universal Title Fatal-4-Way situation sprung to life, and we've already seen a bunch of the card's matches on free TV.\n\nThere are positives, though.\n\nRaw provided a few massive moments that finally made it look like WWE are getting ready for one of the traditional 'Big 4'. SmackDown, not so much, although now there's a clear playing field for those involved into the WWE Title match. The challenger for that belt actually has the chance to prove himself as a WWE headliner - but is it a case of 'too little, too late'?\n\nThe shine has come off WWE's 'Women's Revolution' terribly since Charlotte Flair was moved to SmackDown and her feud with Sasha Banks ended. As much as it sucks to admit, that was the only feud keeping things together in the women's ranks across both brands. SummerSlam proves that.\n\nBoth Naomi vs. Natalya and Alexa Bliss vs. Sasha Banks feel like afterthoughts before they've even happened, and that's not good. What happened to all that excitement surrounding the change from Divas to Superstars that WWE were touting just a year or so ago? Neither of SummerSlam's female matches feel like as important as other matches on the card.\n\nNatalya is a placeholder for Naomi and a thinly-veiled excuse to prolong the babyface's reign. Meanwhile, Bliss hasn't recovered from a terrible feud with Bayley and Banks is unbalanced without Charlotte, the yin to her yang. These matches just feels thrown together because there's nothing else better to do, which isn't good enough for the Summer's biggest show.", "id": "9806451", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "4 Ups & 4 Downs Before WWE SummerSlam 2017", "image": "https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2017/08/254221f46e3c7571-600x400.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 87, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 96}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

His absence is quite similar to his booking last year, but the WWE Universe is still wondering how much longer until The Game returns to WWE television. The expectation is he'll return to Raw to rekindle his old rivalry with Kurt Angle, but the powers that be may have very different plans for HHH's return to WWE television.\n\nIt's being reported that Triple H is expected to appear much more on television by the end of this year, and he will be a regular performer on the Road to WrestleMania 34. WWE officials are keeping his creative plans a secret to almost everyone backstage. However, it's come to light that The Game may be featured on SmackDown Live instead of Raw next year to help elevate the show's ratings heading into New Orleans.\n\nBecause his plans are being kept under wraps, it's unclear how WWE officials are planning to book him on \"the blue brand,\" or who they plan for him to feud with after his return. SmackDown Live's roster is full of strong wrestlers and performers who have come up through NXT. There are several options for Triple H to choose for his next great rival, but WWE fans will have to wait quite some time to find out who that will be.\n\nHeading into Orlando, there was some speculation that WrestleMania 33 could be the last hurrah for The Game. There is no question that Triple H's in-ring career is winding down, but he is still in great shape, so he's likely trying to wrestle as much as he can before hanging up the boots for good. An extended run at the end of this year into next year could also be an indication that WrestleMania 34 will be HHH's curtain call.\n\nThere will be a lot of speculation about Triple H's next feud on Raw or SmackDown Live. The Game could return to WWE television as a babyface or a heel. He has favored the latter over recent years, but HHH may make a change for the right opponent. For instance, a rivalry with Kevin Owens would likely see him as the babyface, but a feud with AJ Styles would most likely make Triple H the heel. The possibilities are exciting whether he returns to Raw or SmackDown Live.

If the swaps are as widespread as they were back in April, eventually much won't be mixed up whatsoever, but if they have their heart set, here are some names to keep an eye on in case of a brand switch.\n\nChris Jericho - SmackDown Live \u2192 Raw\n\nHis return to the blue brand was a bizarre one-night stint that virtually breaks all of the momentum he had going in a rivalry with Kevin Owens before he departed. Now that Owens appears embroiled in a program with commissioner Shane McMahon, one of the two men will have to move on from the show, which means that yet again, Raw is Jericho could become a reality.\n\nDepending on what route they go, a Jericho-Miz rivalry over the Intercontinental Championship would be mic work gold, or a Jericho-Balor feud could provide some scintillating matches if heel Y2J is back in the mix.\n\nBraun Strowman - Raw \u2192 SmackDown Live\n\nThe choice to move Strowman over comes with the obvious caveat that he not be Universal Champion after SummerSlam. If he does claim the belt in the Fatal 4-Way, it's unlikely the champion swap portion of the superstar shake-up is on the way at this point.\n\nShould he not be carrying the belt, Strowman could use a fresh start against opponents that aren't Roman Reigns. He would immediately interject himself into the main-event scene on SmackDown Live and have the opportunity to claim the WWE Championship.\n\nKarl Anderson & Luke Gallows - Raw \u2192 SmackDown Live\n\nThe former tag team champions have been stuck in a rut in terms of booking for some time. They have seen other hyped tag teams either return to action or arrive in the WWE around them and receive a healthy diet of opportunities, i.e. The Hardy Boyz, The Revival, and even Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose.\n\nThey were at their peak working alongside A.J. Styles in the short-lived WWE Club reunion in early 2016. If creative has their heart set on keeping Finn Balor a babyface for the time being, the three men being on the same show serves purely as a tease. Over on SmackDown Live, they'll be able to immediately enter the tag title scene against The New Day or The Usos, helping a division that desperately needs healthy bodies.\n\nThe Ascension - SmackDown Live \u2192 Raw\n\nDespite the aforementioned SmackDown Live tag team division deficiencies, The Ascension has been put so far on the back burner that their biggest contribution the past few months has been their cameos in Fandango and Tyler Breeze's \"Fashion Files\" skits.\n\nFormer NXT Tag Team Champions Konnor and Viktor haven't been given a fair shake to at least find their way on the roster as the heavy-metal tough guy personas they display. Moving over to Raw with their surplus of groups won't be ideal, but it will at least give them some fresh competition.\n\nEmma - Raw \u2192 SmackDown Live\n\n#GiveEmmaAChance is growing with fervor by the day. Despite the fact that she's dangerously close to bordering on becoming the outright jobber of the women's division, Emma remains one of the roster's most supremely talented and underutilized superstars.\n\nDue to its size, the women's division doesn't have the luxury to hide wrestlers. Emma cannot be the easy victory everyone uses to jump the line, which is quickly what her character on Raw has become as she whines and then loses. Moving her to SmackDown Live would help a division that has gotten stale quickly.\n\nNatalya - SmackDown Live \u2192 Raw\n\nMuch in the same ilk of Braun Strowman earlier, Natalya's move would be predicated on the fact that she isn't champion when SummerSlam comes to a close. She earned her shot against Naomi at SummerSlam, but the power of the glow is going strong on SmackDown Live and Natty seems to be stuck in neutral on the blue brand.\n\nAfter heading the \"Welcoming Committee,\" just to watch Carmella win Money in the Bank -- twice -- Natayla was stuck on the fringes before her win at Battleground. Getting fresh competition on Raw could help her rejuvenate her character.\n\nRelated Items:WWE", "id": "9806444", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "These 6 superstars could use a brand switch during superstar shake-up", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17092305/AP_509523321948.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "id": "304688", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "id": "307120", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.J.

The supershow card, featuring stars from both Raw and SmackDown, features the culmination of several key rivalries and, in all likelihood, will plant the seeds for several storylines that won't play out entirely until next year's WrestleMania.\n\nWith that in mind, we're breaking down every match on the SummerSlam card, with a particular focus on the two major titles on each show -- the Universal championship, Raw women's championship, WWE championship and SmackDown women's championship.\n\nTo kick off the week's series of cheat sheets, we'll take a look at the SmackDown women's championship match between Naomi and Natalya.\n\nFor everything else you need to know about SummerSlam, click here.\n\nIn mid-April, following the Superstar Shakeup, SmackDown was left to rebuild its women's division after losing longtime champ Alexa Bliss to Monday Night Raw.\n\nOn the surface, it seemed Tuesday night's show would not suffer from a dearth of star power as it acquired Charlotte Flair, the most dominant woman in the WWE. Surprisingly, as the weeks went by, Flair went through a subtle character metamorphosis and became part of an alliance with current champ Naomi and Becky Lynch.\n\nMeanwhile, Natalya affixed herself with Carmella and Tamina, a faction that facetiously called itself the \"Welcoming Committee.\"\n\nAfter a few mostly disappointing attempts to lift the less-than-stellar heel trio, the contenders were thrown into a Fatal Five-Way elimination match at Battleground late last month, with Natalya coming out on top.\n\nWith little direct conflict between the Natalya and Naomi, the overall heat has felt somewhat forced. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the upcoming encounter is the unknown -- will Money in the Bank winner Carmella play a role in the outcome and walk away from SummerSlam as the champ?\n\nWhatever your thoughts are on Natalya, she has played the heel role well in recent weeks, though it's curious how she was scarcely a presence in last week on SmackDown as Naomi faced Carmella. While the anticipation has been underwhelming, Natalya has a villain-like vibe that will make this encounter a classic, and hopefully compelling, battle for the belt.\n\n\"This is the classic 'flash versus the old-school wrestler.' Hart is family-trained in 'the dungeon' -- a classic technician -- versus Naomi, who brings this eclectic, aerial style, and is, in some ways, one of the best athletes we have in the WWE. But I think a lot of people look at her and see a lot of flash. That's an unfair assessment.\n\n\"It's going to be a fun one to see because almost everyone that Natalya faces is better when they leave the ring. Certain talent that you get in the ring have a certain way of having people rise to you in that skill level, and she's that way. I expect this to be a really good match.\"\n\nIt took time for Naomi to reach the apex of the women's division on SmackDown, but she has proved she is a worthy title-holder since winning at WrestleMania. She brings energy and excitement into the ring and her performances are never dull. You'd like to think she should hold on to the title longer to establish bona-fide heat with someone more high-profile, whether that's Lynch or Flair, before succumbing at a marquee event -- ideally, one of the \"big four\". To date, Naomi has not had an extended feud with anyone, which is pretty rare (and disappointing) for a champion in this business.\n\nHer family pedigree aside, outside a brief stint as Divas champ seven years ago, Natalya has largely failed to make the leap from mid-card staple to featured attraction. It's hard to say exactly what the WWE has in store on the creative front for her, but giving her a one-on-one match at SummerSlam speaks to their belief she could be something more, even if she suffers a loss here in the short-term.\n\nStill, a win, while surprising, would give SmackDown a legit top-end women's heel, something the show does not have at the moment. It would open up more permutations in the overall field. For months, SmackDown has tried to conceal its overall lack of depth in their women's division by adding stipulations like Fatal Five-Ways. Natalya is a veteran performer, who while not the most obvious choice to make the Jinder Mahal-like leap to the elite circle, would add a welcome new dimension in this so-called land of opportunity.\n\nSummerSlam will be the 12th overall one-on-one meeting between Naomi and Natalya, but the first to occur at a pay-per-view event. Naomi won seven of the first 11 meetings, most recently defeating Natalya on SmackDown Live on Nov. 8, 2016.

At one point in the match, Seth performed a running powerbomb and slammed Finn into the safety barrier outside the ring, and disaster struck.\n\nFinn suffered a 180 degree labrum tear, a torn bicep and pectoral tendon, cartilage damage and a fracture to the glenoid neck socket.\n\nThis wasn't enough to thwart The Demon King, however, as he went to defeat Seth Rollins with his patented Coup De Grace and became the first ever WWE Universal Champion.\n\nHe also became the first ever Superstar to relinquish the Title, as his injuries were too severe to continue in the ring for several months.\n\nBalor is currently on the road back to the top, most recently ending his rivalry with Elias and is now in the midst of mind games with The Eater of Worlds, Bray Wyatt, who he faces this Sunday at SummerSlam.\n\nBrock Lesnar was the specimen that blasted on the scene in 2002, attacking Al Snow, Maven and Spike Dudley, with the latter being on the receiving end of a devastating triple powerbomb. And who was by his side? None other than The Advocate, Paul Heyman, who was seen barking orders.\n\nAt the time, Brock was nicknamed \"The Next Big Thing\", and boy were they right. His first feud was with The Hardy Boyz, defeating them at multiple PPVs including Backlash and Judgement Day.\n\nAfter winning the King of the Ring final against RVD, Brock earned his WWE Undisputed Championship shot against The Rock at SummerSlam 2002. Brock executed his own Rock Bottom and F5, and with the help of an interference from Paul Heyman, he landed the big time and won his first championship.\n\nBrock began to make an even bigger name for himself as he went to war with The Undertaker at No Mercy, defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match.\n\nWe all know how The Deadman and The Beast's rivalry progressed in the future.\n\nLesnar went on to feud with Big Show, the feud that led Paul Heyman to betray him. Lesnar would suffer his first pin fall loss to Show at Survivor Series, which catapulted his reputation with the fans, and went on to do great things with the company.\n\nKurt Angle's first appearance at WWE came in 1999, quickly establishing his American Hero character based on his gold medal win at the 1998 Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter his initial stint as a \"good guy\", fans quickly began to boo his entrances, which Kurt quickly capitalised on and turned into a villain, patronising his fellow Superstars and the audience themselves.\n\nJust a year later, Angle won the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and then losing both titles without ever conceding a fall in a two-pin Triple Threat match at WrestleMania 2000.\n\nWith these two Titles a distant memory, he then became a top-tier Superstar, feuding with The Rock and Triple H which led to a Triple Threat Match at SummerSlam. Angle was stretchered out during the match after a Pedigree through the announcement table.\n\nAs The People's Champion and The King of Kings battled on, Kurt would be brought back in alongside Vince McMahon to take on Triple H, but after a tussle between The Game and Kurt over a sledgehammer, Vince was on the receiving end of a bash.\n\nWith Kurt and Triple H distracted, the Rock threw the American Hero over the ropes, and then pinned The Game after dishing out The People's Elbow.\n\nSummerSlam would be the catalyst to spark his career. He would go on to have a heated rivalry with Triple H, with Kurt frequently interfering in The Game's matches and ruining his title opportunities.\n\nThey'd go on to do battle a week before Unforgiven, as Angle attacked Triple H with a sledgehammer, leading to the American Hero kissing Stephanie McMahon as her husband lay unconscious in the ring.\n\nTriple H earned vengeance at Unforgiven, but Kurt would go on to have one of the greatest rivalries in recent memories against Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n\nSummerSlam 1998 was nicknamed \"Highway to Hell\", with a fierce main card on the table. Stone Cold was due to defend his title against The Undertaker, Ken Shamrock had a huge bout with Owen Hart, and X-Pac battled Jeff Jarret, but it was the two young guns that stole the show - The Rock and Triple H.\n\nThe two up and coming Superstars faced off in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title, with carnage ensuing. After weaponising the ladder to both their advantages, Chyna delivered a low blow to The Rock which allowed HHH to win the Intercontinental Title.\n\nUnfortunately, Triple H would be sidelined with a knee injury and gave up the title, but while he was away The Rock went on to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series.\n\nThe two would reignite their rivalry in an I Quit match, The Rock accompanied by Kane and The Game by Chyna. Much to Triple H's dismay, he was forced to say I Quit to stop Kane chokeslamming Chyna.\n\nHowever, Chyna later attacked Triple H, showing that she planned to betray him all along.\n\nThe Game would then go on to have one of his most memorable heel turns, and become a part of The Corporation.\n\nDaniel Bryan is the Rocky of the WWE Universe - the true underdog story that everyone wanted to succeed. His unconventional looks, his smaller frame, his wild facial hair, it was everything that the WWE hadn't seen in a Title contender before. But nobody resonated with the fans better than the do-or-die Daniel Bryan.\n\nBefore SummerSlam 2013, the Team Hell No tag-team was formed of Bryan and Kane, where they would often bicker between themselves during matches. They would go on to have a successful run as WWE Tag Team Champions, feuding with the likes of Team Rhodes Scholars, 3MB and, later down the line, The Shield, who they lost the titles to.\n\nBryan became obsessed to prove he wasn't the weak link of Team Hell No and launched the \"Yes!' movement, becoming more aggressive in the process.\n\nThis was the year he began to become the Superstar that put his name in lights. After Team Hell No separated, Bryan went on to better Randy Orton in a rivalry, and continued his hot streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian.\n\nThe crowd was pining for Bryan to win the Money in the Bank that year, but was foiled by Curtis Axel, a non-participant, with Randy Orton picking up the win.\n\nHowever, the crowd would have their dreams come true as John Cena picked Bryan to be his opponent at SummerSlam 2013. This is where The Corporation began to dampen any hopes Bryan would have at victory by psychologically and physically damaging him. Bryan was labelled the 'B+ Player', he was put through gauntlet matches, and was made to face his old tag-team partner Kane.\n\nNone of that mattered, as Cena and Bryan went hammer and tong, as the Yes Man beat the odds to become the WWE Champion. Special referee Triple H, however, had other plans, and planted a Pedigree to Bryan. Orton would cash in his Money in the Bank and cut the title reign short.\n\nSummerSlam would further propel his connection with the crowd, and went on to create the biggest atmospheres in stadiums across the world from his matches - he'd feud with The Corporation, Randy Orton, and the up and coming Bray Wyatt.\n\nBryan would go on to main event WrestleMania XXX, defeating Batista and Randy Orton in a Triple Threat Match to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion.", "id": "9792229", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Some of the most iconic match-ups in recent SummerSlam

Lewis has denied wrongdoing and is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. He has also denied trying to quash stories on the topic.\n\nFord's draft chapters from 2017 and 2018, shared at the time with a cohort of journalists and others, reflect his efforts to blow the whistle on hacking and other illicit newsgathering methods.\n\nThose efforts prompted a 2018 Guardian profile, in which Ford said, \"I was nothing more than a common thief.\" He counted private investigators among his clients and said he performed most of his work for the Sunday Times, never taking on a formal role or even entering its office, but estimating that he was paid 40,000 pounds a year for his exploits. He said in that profile that he pursued leading politicians, including Blair and another former prime minister, Gordon Brown; celebrities such as Paul McCartney; and a former head of MI6, the secretive foreign intelligence service.\n\nFord wrote in his draft chapters that he came to know Winnett as a young reporter at the Sunday Times, where Winnett began writing as a student in 1995.\n\nLewis became business editor of the Sunday Times in 2002. He remained there until 2005, when he became city editor of the Telegraph, a center-right paper identified with Britain's Conservative Party. He quickly climbed the ranks of that outlet.\n\nWinnett joined Lewis at the Telegraph in 2007, and two years later they worked closely together on an investigation into phony expenses by members of Parliament that rocked the political establishment and forced a wave of resignations.\n\nThe stories that the Telegraph published in 2009 arose from data that the paper had acquired as part of a transaction in which they paid about 150,000 pounds to a private investigator seeking to sell the material on behalf of another source, according to an account Lewis later provided as part of a public inquiry into media practices. Lewis has described the Telegraph's work as a high-water mark for the British press, \"one of the most important bits of journalism, if not the most important bit of journalism, in the postwar period.\"\n\nWithin a year, the British industry's practices were engulfed in an expanding scandal, fueled by revelations that News of the World, a best-selling tabloid in Murdoch's media empire, had engaged in widespread hacking of the phones of politicians, celebrities and even victims of violent crimes in the pursuit of salacious stories.\n\nLewis left the Telegraph in 2010 to join the Murdoch-controlled News International as a senior executive. Within months, he would be charged with helping to manage the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal, a position that involved overseeing the provision of evidence to a Metropolitan Police investigation that swelled to include hundreds of officers.\n\nIt was during this period that Ford made his desperate call to Winnett - a decision Ford briefly recounted in a 2018 piece he published in Byline Investigates, a journalism website edited by Graham Johnson, a former tabloid reporter turned whistleblower on journalism ethics. The same year, Byline Investigates published invoices, on its website and in a YouTube video, showing numerous payments to Ford from the Sunday Times parent company, News International.\n\nA line item on one of the invoices includes only the description \"LEEDS\" for a payment related to a story published in September 2004. That month, Winnett and another reporter broke the news that an Iraqi businessman worth 1.3 billion pounds was preparing a bid to take over Leeds United.\n\nThe story quoted what it described as an unnamed friend of the businessman and divulged plans to move the club and redevelop the area surrounding its stadium. Other Sunday Times stories published that month that make reference to Leeds are all straightforward sports or politics write-ups and human-interest pieces about property or interior design.\n\nIn 2002, Winnett and two co-authors wrote about a blind trust in which Blair, the prime minister at the time, had parked profits from the sale of his family's home. It followed a line of reporting about blind trusts connected to officials in Blair's Labour Party that, in one of his unpublished drafts, Ford claims credit for having helped launch for the Sunday Times five years earlier. Ford did so, he wrote, by altering his voice as part of a ruse to obtain information from the bank Barclays.\n\nThe 2002 article co-written by Winnett laid out the political connections of one of the fund's two trustees, describing a set of real estate transactions for which the fund nearly failed to gain financing until a third party informed the bank that the loan was for Blair's trust. The article did not reveal how the paper had learned about the private exchanges, saying only that the Sunday Times \"has established\" the information.\n\nTo Ford, one story in particular stood out. He told the Guardian in the 2018 profile that he had used a fake German accent in June 2002 to dupe a Mercedes-Benz employee into disclosing a list of buyers for the new Maybach supercar on a secret assignment for the Sunday Times newsroom. He said he regretted the move because the employee later lost his job.\n\nWinnett reported in June 2002 that 60 British-based millionaires had placed orders for the new Maybach model. \"Sources say,\" Winnett wrote, that buyers had put down deposits of 50,000 pounds for a modern version of what had once been \"the Nazis' favourite limousine.\" The New York Times first linked Ford's public comments to the Winnett story.\n\nCo-authors of these stories either declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries.\n\nMark Lewis, a media lawyer who has brought high-profile phone-hacking claims, said revealing who had ordered high-end cars was plainly unjustified by public interest, the exemption carved out for blagging under U.K. law. \"It seems like the perfect example of something that interests the public but has no public interest,\" he said.\n\nA Sunday Times spokesperson declined to address specific stories but pointed to a past statement saying the paper \"has employed many contributors and researchers to work on stories, or parts of stories\" but \"strongly rejects the accusation that it has in the past retained or commissioned any individual to act illegally.\"\n\nFord divulged in his 2018 piece for Byline Investigates that he had sought Blair's manuscript at the behest of the Sunday Times. After his arrest, however, he contacted Winnett, by then at the Telegraph, because Winnett \"remained in close contact with his friend Will Lewis, one of the leaders of News International's Management and Standards Committee (the unit Murdoch set up to clean house after phone hacking).\"\n\nAfter Ford's arrest, on allegations of fraud by false representation, Winnett recommended a lawyer, Ford recalled in the draft book chapters. Winnett urged calm, telling him, \"they'll sort you out.\"\n\nThey met for Chinese food, according to the draft chapters. Among others who attended the meal, according to Ford's drafts, was a longtime Winnett colleague: Claire Newell, the Sunday Times journalist who, in Ford's telling, had asked him to obtain the Blair manuscript.\n\nNewell had been arrested in 2004 under suspicion that she had passed government papers to the Sunday Times while working as a temporary secretary in the Cabinet Office, the Guardian reported at the time. Winnett had helped arrange for Newell to pass confidential leaks to the paper, according to an account in a book by journalist Nick Davies, Flat Earth News.\n\nNewell was questioned in 2004 but not charged. She then returned to the Sunday Times, where she had written several stories in 2003, and subsequently joined Winnett at the Telegraph, where she serves as investigations editor. She did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen Ford shared concerns about the reverberations of his own arrest, he recalled in one draft chapter, Winnett described the code of silence prevailing inside the Telegraph, where many reporters and editors had previously worked at the Sunday Times. That shared experience, according to Ford's drafts, meant no one would blow the whistle on the tactics that had landed him in jail.\n\n\"It was clear that most had no idea of the specifics of my incident but people knew something had happened,\" he wrote in the drafts. \"It is pretty incredible that a group of journalists could collectively cover up this story.\"\n\nFord did not remain invisible for long, becoming a flash point in a vexed public debate over press ethics in Britain.\n\nJohn Witherow, a former longtime editor of the Sunday Times, acknowledged in public testimony and statements in 2011 and 2012 that the paper had repeatedly employed Ford and two private investigators to impersonate public officials, sports regulators and others to obtain stories it deemed in the public interest. Witherow's admissions came in response to a year-long government investigation known as the Leveson Inquiry that sprung from revelations of phone hacking by the Murdoch-controlled News of the World tabloid.\n\nIn the fallout from those revelations, Witherow sought to crack down on the use of subterfuge in reporting, prohibiting pseudonyms and alter egos, according to the Guardian.\n\nStill, he made a public-interest case for blagging under questioning by members of Parliament in 2012. He gave an example of a reporter posing as a businessman to see if a lawmaker would take money to ask questions in a government hearing. The reporting led to the suspension of two lawmakers, he noted.\n\nWitherow said Ford was one of the paper's regular blaggers and had worked on \"various investigations,\" including into the soccer authority FIFA. Witherow did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFormer Sunday Times journalists who overlapped with Winnett and Lewis at the newspaper, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter's sensitivity, characterized the methods as infrequent and often justified in the public interest.\n\n\"British journalism is naughtier and scrappier,\" said one journalist who worked with both Winnett and Lewis. \"There's a feeling of being embattled because access to public information is so much more restricted here.\"\n\nBut Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster who has consulted parliamentary committees on press standards, said reporters who rely on blagging are using \"illegal means\" but letting others bear the brunt of the risk.\n\n\"People like Ford are exploited and very useful, and then, when it all went wrong and the whole system was exposed, the senior editorial people like Winnett all shrug and say, 'I had no idea what was going on, look over at that bloke there,' who is by then cowering in the corner alone,\" Barnett said.\n\nSometimes, the techniques fall flat, as in the case of Ford's alleged attempt to obtain Blair's yet-to-be-released memoir.\n\nRandom House told authorities that suspicious calls had been made to obtain the manuscript in the summer of 2010, according to police records. Authorities traced the phone number back to Ford, who was soon arrested. At his home, police found jottings with the words Random House, as well as a Dell computer used to access an email address identified with the maneuver, according to police records.\n\nFord turned to the law firm that he would later say was recommended by Winnett, according to the draft chapters and the police records. And in early 2012, he was given a caution, an official police warning in lieu of a prosecution.\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors":

That's according to publisher Will Lewis:\n\nIn a presentation to employees on Wednesday morning, Post publisher Will Lewis painted a stark picture of The Post's finances, revealing that the publication has lost $77 million over the last year and has been bleeding digital readers for several years. \"To speak candidly: We are in a hole, and we have been for some time,\" he said.\n\nAnd just last week the Post reported on Jeff Bezos's attempt to reshuffle things at the paper in a way that might produce better results.\n\nWhat Bezos wants from and for The Post has remained the compelling question through a week of internal turmoil, during which his handpicked new publisher and CEO, William Lewis, abruptly replaced the newspaper's first female executive editor and announced a reorganization of the newsroom -- the exact plans for which remain unclear -- in a bid to boost earnings...\n\nBoth Lewis and Robert Winnett, the British editor he has tapped to take over the traditional news division this fall, are veterans of the Telegraph, a London newspaper where they collaborated on a blockbuster investigation of government corruption that was lauded but also criticized by some as \"checkbook journalism\" because of the six-figure fee paid to a key source -- a tactic more common in the United Kingdom and generally unaccepted in U.S. newsrooms.\n\n\"The big question is, are he and the editor that he's bringing in, will they understand that they should now change -- that they need to abide by American journalism standards?\" said Leonard Downie, a former Post executive editor. \"That's my concern.\"\n\nRobert Winnett, the incoming editor, got a blast of American journalism late Sunday night in the form of a lengthy investigative report critical of his previous work. That story was published by the Washington Post. The Post even tagged itself in the headline.\n\nThe backyard goodbye party for Sally Buzbee, the recently departed executive editor of The Washington Post, was beginning to break up on Sunday evening when the newspaper published a critical investigation into her permanent successor.\n\nThe headline: \"Incoming Post editor tied to self-described 'thief' who claimed role in his reporting.\"\n\nThe article focused on Robert Winnett, the British journalist poised to take over The Post's newsroom in November, and revealed his links to a private eye who used unethical media practices to land big exclusives. It noted that Mr. Winnett had declined to comment to The Post's reporters -- the same ones he will be managing in a few months.\n\nThe full story is here and it connects Winnett to a guy named John Ford who allegedly did a lot of dubious things to generate scoops.\n\nThat journalist, according to draft book chapters Ford later wrote recounting his ordeal, was Robert Winnett, a Sunday Times veteran who is set to become editor of The Washington Post later this year...\n\nIn one passage, Ford describes working with Winnett on an array of stories about consumer and business affairs. The collaboration, in his account, was part of a broader arrangement with the Sunday Times in which Ford delivered confidential details about Britain's rich and powerful by using dishonest means, including changing their bank passwords and adopting false personas in calls to government agencies. A Sunday Times editor later acknowledged some of these practices but said they were deployed to serve the public interest.\n\nThat caveat at the end is critical because there's a carve out in the law that makes such behavior legal if done to serve the public interest.\n\nAt The Post and other major American news organizations, the use of deceptive tactics in pursuit of news stories violates core ethics policies. In Britain, \"blagging\" -- using misrepresentation to dupe others into revealing confidential information -- has been a known feature of a certain brand of tabloid journalism, especially before a public reckoning over press ethics began in 2011.\n\nSo the question is whether the stories Winnett got from Ford all met that standard. But apart from that question, it seems as if the Post's newsroom is campaigning against their newly announced editor. Will this work? We'll have to wait and see but in the meantime, former President Trump didn't miss the opportunity to slag the Post.\n\n\"The Washington Post is absolutely blowing up with Fake Stories! They ought to clean up their act - Start writing the TRUTH, and maybe they'd get some of their Readers back,\" Trump wrote. \"The Washington Post is on its last leg, there's no reason for them anymore.\"...\n\n\"You would think Bezos, who is losing more than $100 Million a year on that 'RAG,' would want to at least see REAL Journalism, not Fake Stories that do nothing but hurt and demean our Country,\" Trump wrote.

The story accused Winnett of collaborating with self-described \"thief\" John Roberts following his 2010 arrest for his attempt to steal a copy of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's memoir.\n\nThe reporters, citing draft chapters of a never-published book Ford wrote in 2017 and 2018, accused Winnett of connecting Ford with a lawyer who would \"sort [Ford] out,\" according to the outlet. Winnett allegedly assured Ford that his \"clandestine efforts\" would never be publicly known due to the \"remarkable omerta\" of British journalism.\n\nFord and Winnett allegedly met for Chinese food along with a Sunday Times colleague named Claire Newell, who was arrested in 2004 for allegedly passing government papers to the outlet while temporarily working in the Cabinet Office, the Post wrote. Monday's Post story accuses Winnett of arranging for Newell to pass confidential leaks to the Sunday Times, citing a 2008 book by British investigative journalist Nick Davies documenting journalistic malpractice in the United Kingdom.\n\nA passage in Ford's unpublished manuscript allegedly details how he shared confidential materials about British officials while Winnett worked with the Sunday Times after collecting the material through \"dishonest means,\" according to the Post. Ford also claims to have changed a businessman's bank password and adopted false personas in calls to government agencies in order to obtain restricted information, the outlet reported, citing Ford's unpublished writings. (RELATED: Dishonest WaPo Reporter Caught Completely Off Guard During Recorded Call With Dave Portnoy)\n\nA Sunday Times editor reportedly acknowledged these practices and said it was done to serve the public interest.\n\nThe WaPo reporters also reported that their review of Winnett's actions reveals \"an apparent overlap between Winnett's stories and individuals or entities that Ford said he was commissioned to target.\" This use of \"deceptive tactics\" to produce news stories is a violation of \"core ethics policies,\" the Post journalists wrote.\n\n\"In Britain, 'blagging' -- using misrepresentation to dupe others into revealing confidential information -- has been a known feature of a certain brand of tabloid journalism, especially before a public reckoning over press ethics began in 2011. Blagging has been less frequently documented in the broadsheet titles where Winnett and Lewis built their careers,\" the article reads.\n\nThe Post story went on to criticize the paper's CEO and publisher William Lewis, who tapped Winnett for his upcoming role at the outlet and referred to him as a \"world class\" journalist, according to the outlet.\n\n\"Lewis's own journalistic record also has come under scrutiny,\" the article continued. \"The New York Times on Saturday reported that Lewis, as an editor at the Sunday Times in 2004, had assigned a reporter to write a story about a prominent businessman that the reporter believed was based on hacked phone records.\" The ex-reporter, Peter Koenig, told The New York Times that Lewis was a talented editor but that his \"ambition outran his ethics.\"\n\nThe Post journalists also accused Lewis of attempting to suppress reports about a civil court battle in London regarding evidence of the alleged phone hacking. In May, a judge allowed plaintiffs to air claims that Lewis and other individuals were involved in a plan to delete millions of emails allegedly connected to the hacking. Lewis has denied all wrongdoing and is not a defendant in the lawsuit, the outlet reported.

They're angry CEO and publisher William Lewis fired executive editor Sally Buzbee, even though she had three years to right the ship. And they are really angry that White Man Robert Winnett will take her place.\n\nPlease take note that no one at the Post is angry about their employer's role in any of this...\n\nWhat Post staffers are angry about is the very idea of newsroom reforms. These spoiled and entitled fascists believe they have the RIGHT to continue lying to the public to stop Trump. They also believe owner Jeff Bezos should drop $100 million a year to honor that right.\n\nApparently, Lewis and Winnett think differently. At the very least, we know the Trump-haters at the Post and New York Times believe Winnett might institute some serious reforms. Why else would the Post be running stories like this...?\n\nHeadline: \"Incoming Post editor tied to self-described 'thief' who claimed role in his reporting\"...\n\nSub-headline: \"Unpublished book drafts and other documents raise questions about Robert Winnett's journalistic record just months before he is to assume a top newsroom role.\"\n\nThe article goes on to say:\n\nThe alleged offense was trying to steal a soon-to-be-released copy of former prime minister Tony Blair's memoir.\n\nThe suspect arrested by London police in 2010 was John Ford, a once-aspiring actor who has since admitted to an extensive career using deception and illegal means to obtain confidential information for Britain's Sunday Times newspaper. Facing potential prosecution, Ford called a journalist he said he had collaborated with repeatedly -- and trusted to come to his rescue.\n\nThe \"journalist\" in question, Ford claims, was Winnett, who has been chosen to replace Buzbee as executive editor of the paper.\n\nThe post reports that Winnet has not replied to questions about the situation, nor has Ford. Winnet works at the Telegraph as a deputy editor.\n\nThen the hit piece turns on Lewis. \"Lewis's own journalistic record also has come under scrutiny,\" reports the Post, adding:\n\nThe New York Times on Saturday reported that Lewis, as an editor at the Sunday Times in 2004, had assigned a reporter to write a story about a prominent businessman that the reporter believed was based on hacked phone records. The Post has reviewed unpublished writing by Ford in which he claims to have changed the password on the bank account of that businessman, Stuart Rose, so as to gain unauthorized access to Rose's records.\n\nSub-headline: \"Years before becoming The Post's publisher, Will Lewis assigned an article based on stolen phone records, a former reporter said.\"\n\nThe publisher and the incoming editor of The Washington Post, when they worked as journalists in London two decades ago, used fraudulently obtained phone and company records in newspaper articles, according to a former colleague, a published account of a private investigator and an analysis of newspaper archives.\n\nWill Lewis, The Post's publisher, assigned one of the articles in 2004 as business editor of The Sunday Times. Another was written by Robert Winnett, whom Mr. Lewis recently announced as The Post's next executive editor.\n\nFor anyone who hates the corporate media, it does not get any more glorious than this. And trust me, this has zero to do with \"journalistic credibility\" or \"integrity.\" For crying out loud, let's not forget that the New York Times and then CNNLOL hired the disgraced Mark Thompson to run their shops. Thompson is credibly accused of looking the other way for years as the late Jimmy Savile allegedly abused countless children at the BBC. There were no internal hit pieces on Thompson, though. Why? Because Thompson's smart. He makes it clear that he has no intention of reforming anything.\n\nBut like I said, this is good news. No one should want any reforms at the Washington Post. The Post has no credibility. The Post can no longer move the public opinion needle. That's right where we want them. That annual $77 million loss is merely icing.\n\nNothing is better for America than for that garbage fire to keep right on burning.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Lewis (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bezos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thompson_(media_executive)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Thompson (media executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Savile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private investigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Copy_Editing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Copy Editing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Editors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Editors", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/washington_post2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659384", "eventUri": "eng-9659384", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 226, "textEnd": 232}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

While it may be accepted across the pond for some publications, contrary to codes of ethics in most major U.S. newsrooms, including the Post.\n\nWilliam Lewis, a fellow Brit who appointed Winnett to his role, is also under intense scrutiny for journalistic endeavors that contrast with American standards. The New York Times accused Lewis over the weekend of using fraudulently obtained records in his reporting. That's on top of allegations that Lewis tried to kill unfavorable stories at both the Post and NPR.\n\nWhy it matters: When hiring any top executive for a new role, it's always wise to do a thorough background check. This doesn't simply mean criminal record. This means going through their past with a fine-tooth comb to ensure it will hold up to scrutiny when they are thrust into the spotlight.\n\nThat's doubly true when the employees of these new executives are some of the best investigative journalists in the world.\n\nIf the recruiting team at the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post did that due diligence, it isn't in evidence in their responses to these controversies as they come to light. Neither Winnett nor Lewis has offered responses for the investigations, either personally or through a spokesperson.\n\nIt's true that there are definitive cultural and ethical differences between British and American newsrooms. This should have been easily identified during the hiring phase and come with a comprehensive communications plan to get ahead of any potential culture clashes, to respond to new information and to chart a path moving forward.\n\nNone of that seems to have happened. Each response seems to have caught business leaders at the Post flat-footed.\n\nLeadership changes are a particularly delicate time for any organization, and assuring alignment between incoming leaders and the values and ethics of an organization takes work.

He has lost the newsroom and will never win it back.\"\n\nMaraniss also said that Post owner Jeff Bezos, who hired Lewis, is \"not of and for the Post or he would understand.\"\n\nAnother ethical issue raised by the Times article is that Lewis paid 100,000 pounds to a source, a practice generally prohibited at U.S. newspapers.\n\nFor now, though, Bezos appears to be standing by Lewis. He sent a memo to newsroom leaders, saying, \"You have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\" Bezos wrote.\n\nThis reportedly did little to bolster newsroom morale. Reporters are also concerned that the hires of Lewis, Winnett and executive editor Matt Murray may signal a turn to a Murdoch-News Corp. ethos.\n\nFor his part, Lewis has assured the Post newsroom that as publisher, he will not try interfere with editorial. \"I will never cross the line,\" he said. \"These are the editors. I am the publisher. There's a very clear line there, which will be maintained at all times.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if Lewis can ride this out. But there is a certain urgency, given the fact that the Post lost $77 million last year (less than the once-projected $100 million, the Post reports).

That can't change -- and it won't.\"\n\nThe billionaire founder of Amazon bought the Post in 2013. He hired Lewis in November to oversee the business, which had been facing a $77 million shortfall and declining readership, according to company officials.\n\nA rare presence in the newsroom, Bezos is typically in closer touch with its corporate leadership rather than its editorial ranks, which have been in turmoil since Buzbee's unexpected departure, announced to staff in a Sunday night email June 2.\n\nIn his note Tuesday, he directly referenced Lewis, who told staff in small meetings last week that, as publisher, he will never interfere with the journalism produced by the newsroom.\n\n\"I know you've already heard this from Will,\" Bezos wrote, \"but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change.\"\n\nBezos could not be reached for additional comment.\n\nAccording to people familiar with their interactions, Bezos had been closely engaged with Lewis as he developed a plan for a \"third newsroom\" -- a division of the company that would be separate from traditional news and opinion, and would focus on trying to serve audiences not currently consuming the Post, though the details of how it would operate remain opaque. Winnett would oversee the traditional news operations after the 2024 election.\n\nOn Saturday, The New York Times reported Winnett and Lewis, when they worked as journalists in the UK, based some reporting on stolen phone records. The report also raised questions about a payment made to obtain information that led to a 2009 investigation into government corruption that shook the British political establishment and led to several officials' resignations.\n\nOn Sunday, the Post -- citing unpublished book chapters and other documents -- revealed new details about Winnett's collaboration with a self-described \"thief\" who had used illicit means to obtain confidential information that appeared in news articles.\n\nNeither Winnett nor Lewis responded to the Post or the Times about the reports.\n\nAmid these new reports, the Post canceled a dinner it had planned to host Monday night at the annual advertising and media gathering Cannes Lions International Festival in southern France.\n\nEarlier news reports described Lewis attempting to dissuade journalists from covering his involvement in a long-running British phone-hacking lawsuit. Lewis has denied trying to discourage Post journalists from covering the story.

And The Post itself reported in a 3,000-word front page expose Sunday that a \"thief\" who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Lewis' hand-picked incoming top editor, Robert Winnett.\n\nThe stories, which landed like a one-two punch in The Post's newsroom, followed reports that Lewis tried to suppress stories at The Post and NPR about his role cleaning up Rupert Murdoch's UK phone hacking scandal, when he served as a lieutenant to the right-wing media mogul.\n\nIn response to the reports earlier this month, Lewis initially lashed out, criticizing his own media reporters and attacking veteran NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who he referred to as an \"activist, not a journalist.\" Lewis later sent a memo to staffers, striking a notably different tone. But the note failed to quell the growing disapproval within the newspaper's ranks.\n\nInside The Post's newsroom, morale has plunged as staffers express alarm over Lewis' conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper last week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with

newspaper.\n\n\"You have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\" Bezos wrote.\n\nBut the memo did little to quell the growing rebellion in the newsroom.\n\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis.\n\nSonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \"lost legitimacy to lead\" and it's time to \"clean the house.\"\n\n\"This is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage and integrity,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Bezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bezos nevertheless acknowledged that the newspaper needs \"to change as a business.\"\n\nSince arriving at the Post in January, Lewis' previous record has come under intense scrutiny -- including from Post reporters. His early tenure at the paper has been overshadowed by a string of explosive reports alleging that he tried to bury stories about his involvement in a U.K. lawsuit related to a British phone-hacking lawsuit brought by Prince Harry and others. The long-running civil case has heard allegations (which Lewis denies) that Lewis helped to clean up the hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch's British tabloids.\n\nThe sudden resignation of Sally Buzbee, the executive editor of the Post, following Lewis' alleged meddling in the newspaper's coverage of the case -- which Lewis also denies -- led to more scrutiny on his leadership. As has the impending arrival of Robert Winnett, the man who Lewis has chosen to become the new editor of the Post after the presidential election.\n\nThe Post itself reported over the weekend on Winnett's alleged ties to a self-described \"thief\" who claims to have used illegal practices to obtain secret information. Lewis declined to comment to his own reporters' questions for their investigation into the matter.\n\n\"The staff is rightly and fearlessly investigating and questioning the acts of its publisher and supposed next editor whose refusal to answer all questions is inexcusable and unacceptable,\" Maraniss wrote in another Facebook post Tuesday. \"The body is rejecting the transfusion.\"\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

He reportedly sent the note while yachting in Mykonos in the Greek Isles.\n\nBezos seemed to kind of, sort of show his support for the embattled Lewis, but it was unlikely to squash criticisms of Post leaders, which include Lewis and incoming editor Rob Winnett, emanating from inside the walls of the Post.\n\nHere's what Bezos wrote:\n\n\"Team -- I know you've already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change. To be sure, it can't be business as usual at The Post. The world is evolving rapidly and we do need to change as a business. With your support, we'll do that and lead this great institution into the future. But, as the newsroom leaders who've been shaping and guiding our coverage, you also know our standards at The Post have always been very high.\"\n\nBezos added, \"That can't change -- and it won't. You have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in. A huge thank you for continuing to do the work that makes us all proud, and makes this institution so important.\"\n\nAll nice sentiments, of course. But will it satisfy those who work at the Post?\n\nOne Post staffer told The Daily Beast earlier this week, \"I don't know how Will and Rob can stay on at this point. They have lost the entire newsroom.\"\n\nCNN's Oliver Darcy wrote, \"Inside The Post's newsroom, morale has plunged in recent months as alarmed staffers express frustration over Lewis' conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere.\"\n\nHowever, Puck's Dylan Byers wrote in his latest media newsletter, \"Bezos's note was inarguably a declaration of support for Lewis, even if it was muted. He aligned himself with his chief executive ('I know you've already heard this from Will') and stressed that Lewis's leadership would not undermine the Post's ethics and standards. Sure, Bezos left the door open to remove Lewis in the event that the Times or (the Post) unearthed more damning details of wrongdoing -- that door has always been open to him, of course; he owns the joint -- and he didn't really shed any light on whether Winnett would ever step foot in the Post newsroom. (In truth, interim executive editor Matt Murray has become so instantly popular that there isn't a leadership void.) But the general message was that Bezos has Lewis's back, and that the Post staff need to live with that. And, after a brief rumspringa, it was high time to go about the hard work of reversing the company's $77 million in losses and 50 percent decline in readership.\"\n\nOf course, we couldn't go a day without another story about Lewis.\n\nThe Guardian's Anna Isaac and Stephanie Kirchgaessner wrote Wednesday that Lewis once advised then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Johnson's senior officials to \"clean up\" their phones during a COVID-era political scandal.\n\nIsaac and Kirchgaessner wrote, \"The advice is alleged to have been given in December 2021 and January 2022 as top officials were under scrutiny for potential violations of pandemic restrictions, a scandal which was known as 'Partygate'.\"\n\nThe reporters added, \"The claims suggest Lewis's advice contradicted an email sent to staff at No 10 in December 2021 which instructed them not to destroy any material that could be relevant to an investigation into the flagrant breaking of Covid lockdown rules by Johnson and officials who worked for him. Sources said they understood they were being advised to remove photos and messages from their phones that could be damaging in any investigations.\"\n\nAt the time, Lewis was not working for any mainstream media organization and was an informal adviser to Johnson. In late 2023, Lewis was knighted at Johnson's recommendation.\n\nThe Guardian reported that spokespersons for both Lewis and Johnson said The Guardian's story is \"untrue.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is, once again, going off on Fox News and, specifically, former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. Here's what Trump posted Wednesday on his Truth Social:\n\nNobody can ever trust Fox News, and I am one of them, with the weak and ineffective RINO, Paul Ryan, on its Board of Directors. He's a total lightweight, a failed and pathetic Speaker of the House, and a very disloyal person. Romney was bad, but Paul Ryan made him look worse. As a team, they never had a chance. Rupert and Lachlan, get that dog off your Board - You don't need him. ALL YOU NEED IS TRUMP. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nLast week during an appearance on Fox News, Ryan told Neil Cavuto that Trump was unfit for office. Ryan said, \"I think it really is just character at the end of the day. And the fact that if you're willing to put yourself above the Constitution, an oath you swear when you take office in federal office -- whether it's president or a member of Congress, you swear an oath to the Constitution -- and if you're willing to suborn it to yourself, I think that makes you unfit for office.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time Trump has called for Fox to kick Ryan off its board -- in language almost identical to what he posted Wednesday.\n\nAs often as Trump takes to social media to go off on Fox News, he is still a dedicated Fox News viewer and, apparently, advocate. That's according to an analysis of Trump's Truth Social released Wednesday by Howard Polskin, president and founder of TheRighting.\n\n(TheRighting describes itself as a company that aggregates articles from various right-wing news outlets and \"aims to help inform mainstream and liberal audiences about right-wing viewpoints and news not on their radar that are shaping political opinion across the country.\")\n\nIn May, TheRighting found, Trump linked to Fox News Channel 56 times -- more than any other outlet by far. The next closest was Right Side Broadcasting Network, to which he linked 26 times. That was followed by FoxNews.com and Newsmax with 11 links each.\n\nPolskin wrote in a statement, \"This analysis shows that despite Mr. Trump's hot and cold relationship with the Fox News Channel, it was clearly his number one choice in May to shower his followers with links to content that he obviously felt were aligned with his messages. The big surprise was his preference for fringe outlets like RSBN and Real America's Voice over more established outlets like the Washington Examiner and the Washington Times.\"\n\nPolskin noted that Trump did completely ignore some right-wing news sources, such as Daily Signal, Epoch Times, Frank Speech, The Gateway Pundit, Infowars, RedState, Blaze Media and Western Journal.\n\nAs far as mainstream news outlets, Trump linked to The Wall Street Journal once. He linked several times to other outlets such as The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Politico, The New Yorker, NBC News and Reuters.\n\nPolskin said, \"While Trump consistently disparages mainstream or progressive news outlets as 'fake news,' he'll link to those sources if it shows the Biden campaign or Democrats in a poor light.\"\n\nThe great Willie Mays died Tuesday. He was 93.\n\nMays was an American icon. Not just a baseball legend, but an American legend -- one of its most famous and significant people ever. Some say he's the greatest baseball player of all time. I would agree with those people. There are plenty of remembrances of his life and career out there, but I wanted to link to a few of the ones I found interesting:\n\nLast Sunday's Indiana Fever-Chicago Sky WNBA game on CBS averaged 2.25 million viewers, making it the most-watched WNBA game on any network in 23 years. The game featured former college rivals Caitlin Clark (Iowa) and Angel Reese (LSU). Two of their college games are among the most-watched women's basketball games of all time. They met in the NCAA Tournament during the Elite Eight round this past spring with 12.3 million watching on ESPN. Their meeting in the 2023 national championship averaged 9.9 million.\n\nBut back to the WNBA. Front Office Sports' Margaret Fleming reports that all of the national networks that show WNBA games -- ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, Ion, NBA TV and now CBS -- have set single-game TV ratings for their network this season. All those games featured Clark.\n\nHey, USA Basketball, are you sure you don't want Clark on your team?\n\nTNT \"Inside the NBA\" analyst Charles Barkley recently announced that he planned to retire after next season. It's expected that Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns TNT, will not be among the networks securing NBA television rights when the current deals end after the 2024-25 season. (Most believe the rights will go to ABC/ESPN, NBC and Amazon Prime in a deal that could be announced soon.)\n\nBarkley, 61, said that no matter what happens, he plans to retire after next season. Even though he has hinted at retirement in the past, he sounded sincere this time. I believe that he believes he will retire. I'm just not sure he will.\n\nThe Athletic's insightful sports media columnist Richard Deitsch wrote, \"I have interviewed Barkley many times, but I don't want to overstate my insight about him. I don't know much about his life away from his job. But in all of my interactions with him over more than a dozen years, including once interviewing him in front of nearly 1,000 people at the South By Southwest festival, I don't think I've ever seen him alone. He's always with someone. If you have never read this story about Barkley and a gentleman named Lin Wang, I think you'll find it illuminating because it offers insight into Barkley's desire to be around people. This is why I don't think he will leave sports broadcasting.\"\n\nDeitsch noted that Barkley made his comments at the end of a long NBA season, a busy work schedule, and in the wake of topsy-turvy TV rights negotiations that clearly frustrated Barkley.\n\nDeitsch wrote, \"I don't think this is a negotiating ploy because he'd have no problem getting paid $15 million to $20 million annually in a future deal. I also think he legitimately meant what he said last week. But save this prediction: I don't think it will stick. With rest and a recharge, Barkley will continue on television beyond 2025.\"\n\nHave feedback or a tip?

Lewis is in charge of turning the newspaper around, which reported losses last year of $77 million.\n\nControversy erupted at the Post following recent reports that Lewis attempted to suppress stories about a long-running civil court battle related to phone hacking during his tenure at billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News International.\n\nLewis' new hire, incoming editor Robert Winnett, a former colleague and mentee during tenure at UK newspapers, is also under scrutiny amid claims he hired a self-confessed \"thief\" to use illegal tactics in gathering confidential information for reporting.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bezos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Maraniss", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Maraniss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Lewis (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_hacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phone hacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_proprietor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media proprietor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rupert Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Copy_Editing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Copy Editing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AP21203747594149-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659384", "eventUri": "eng-9659384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

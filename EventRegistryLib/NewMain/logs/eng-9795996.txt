Get the lead and then finish strong,\" Thomas said, recounting Tonja Buford-Bailey's counsel. \"And I did that.\"\n\nShe sure did. Following precisely that easier-said-than-done plan, Thomas, a 27-year-old Harvard grad, sped to the victory in the women's 200 meters at the 2024 Olympics on Tuesday night, finishing in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago.\n\n\"I don't think,\" Thomas said, \"it could have gone any better.\"\n\nShe burst into the lead for good at the curve and was never challenged down the stretch, finishing well clear of 100-meter champion Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, who was 0.25 seconds off the pace in 22.08.\n\nAfter Thomas crossed the line, she shouted and placed both of her hands on her head, looking every bit like someone enjoying what she called \"the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you where my competitors were in that race, because I blacked out,\" Thomas said.\n\nThat's one explanation. Another would be that there was no one really all that near her.\n\nBrittany Brown of the U.S. got the bronze in 22.20, 0.02 seconds in front of Dina Asher-Smith of Britain, who was another hundredth of a second ahead of teammate Daryll Neita.\n\n\"I'm happy. There's nothing I can complain about,\" Alfred said. \"I just know I went out there and gave my best.\"\n\nOut of three sprints so far on the purple track at Stade de France, the Americans have picked up two golds: Thomas' triumph followed Noah Lyles' success in the men's 100 on Sunday night by a far slimmer margin: five thousands of a second.\n\n\"It really was so inspiring, hearing Noah go after what he wanted and take it,\" Thomas said. \"I knew that if I were in any position in this race, I could still go after it and take it if I had to.\"\n\nAsk a teammate what about Thomas is most impressive, and \"poise\" is a word that comes up.\n\n\"She's very much an empowerment woman. She carries a lot of power. You can tell by how she carries herself,\" said McKenzie Long, a 24-year-old who finished seventh Tuesday. \"She reminds me of me -- but an older version.\"\n\nAfter she earned her degree at Harvard in neurobiology and global health, Thomas enrolled at the University of Texas, where she got a Masters in public health for studying sleep patterns of different ethnic groups -- while also making the wise choice to double down on her track training.\n\nThe decision was to set up a six-year schedule, with the long-term aim being this cool evening in the City of Light. Thomas didn't want the Paris Games to be her first Olympics, so she did what it took to get herself to Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThat happened -- and her takeaways from that trip to Japan were third place in the 200, a silver medal in the 4\u00d7100 relay, plus, maybe most valuable of all, the experience.\n\n\"I feel like I've worked very hard, and everything has been a part of the plan. This has been a six-year plan, ever since moving to Texas,\" Thomas explained. \"We've been working hard every day for this, so I earned it. But it's still an unbelievable, indescribable feeling.\"\n\nShe came in as one of the favorites, especially after reigning world champion Shericka Jackson of Jamaica dropped out because of an apparent injury.\n\nAnd this one really wasn't even close, it turned out.\n\nEven Alfred, who also went to Texas and won the first Olympic medal for her island country in the 100 three nights earlier, didn't stand a chance against Thomas on this night.\n\n\"You can't take a gold medal away. This is all I wanted,\" Thomas said. \"If I didn't get this gold medal today, I don't know what I would have done.\"\n\nAnd she isn't done.

Get the lead and then finish strong,\" Thomas said, recounting Tonja Buford-Bailey's counsel. \"And I did that.\"\n\nShe sure did. Following precisely that easier-said-than-done plan, Thomas, a 27-year-old Harvard grad, sped to the victory in the women's 200 meters at the 2024 Olympics on Tuesday night, finishing in 21.83 seconds to add a gold to the bronze she took home in the event from Tokyo three years ago.\n\n\"I don't think,\" Thomas said, \"it could have gone any better.\"\n\nShe burst into the lead for good at the curve and was never challenged down the stretch, finishing well clear of 100-meter champion Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, who was 0.25 seconds off the pace in 22.08.\n\nAfter Thomas crossed the line, she shouted and placed both of her hands on her head, looking every bit like someone enjoying what she called \"the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you where my competitors were in that race, because I blacked out,\" Thomas said.\n\nThat's one explanation. Another would be that there was no one really all that near her.\n\nBrittany Brown of the U.S. got the bronze in 22.20, 0.02 seconds in front of Dina Asher-Smith of Britain, who was another hundredth of a second ahead of teammate Daryll Neita.\n\n\"I'm happy. There's nothing I can complain about,\" Alfred said. \"I just know I went out there and gave my best.\"\n\nOut of three sprints so far on the purple track at Stade de France, the Americans have picked up two golds: Thomas' triumph followed Noah Lyles' success in the men's 100 on Sunday night by a far slimmer margin: five thousands of a second.\n\n\"It really was so inspiring, hearing Noah go after what he wanted and take it,\" Thomas said. \"I knew that if I were in any position in this race, I could still go after it and take it if I had to.\"\n\nAsk a teammate what about Thomas is most impressive, and \"poise\" is a word that comes up.\n\n\"She's very much an empowerment woman. She carries a lot of power. You can tell by how she carries herself,\" said McKenzie Long, a 24-year-old who finished seventh Tuesday. \"She reminds me of me -- but an older version.\"\n\nAfter she earned her degree at Harvard in neurobiology and global health, Thomas enrolled at the University of Texas, where she got a Masters in public health for studying sleep patterns of different ethnic groups -- while also making the wise choice to double down on her track training.\n\nThe decision was to set up a six-year schedule, with the long-term aim being this cool evening in the City of Light. Thomas didn't want the Paris Games to be her first Olympics, so she did what it took to get herself to Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThat happened -- and her takeaways from that trip to Japan were third place in the 200, a silver medal in the 4\u00d7100 relay, plus, maybe most valuable of all, the experience.\n\n\"I feel like I've worked very hard, and everything has been a part of the plan. This has been a six-year plan, ever since moving to Texas,\" Thomas explained. \"We've been working hard every day for this, so I earned it. But it's still an unbelievable, indescribable feeling.\"\n\nShe came in as one of the favorites, especially after reigning world champion Shericka Jackson of Jamaica dropped out because of an apparent injury.\n\nAnd this one really wasn't even close, it turned out.\n\nEven Alfred, who also went to Texas and won the first Olympic medal for her island country in the 100 three nights earlier, didn't stand a chance against Thomas on this night.\n\n\"You can't take a gold medal away. This is all I wanted,\" Thomas said. \"If I didn't get this gold medal today, I don't know what I would have done.\"\n\nAnd she isn't done. She'll have a chance for another medal as part of the 4\u00d7100 relay team, which could be in the final Saturday.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If I didn't get this gold medal today I don't know what I would have done.\n\n\"I'm really in disbelief because having an Olympic gold medal is something in my wildest dreams. But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it.\n\n\"This has been six years in the making, head down, working hard, going to really hard meets, pushing yourself, and now it's here and I've done it. This is the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\nSt. Lucia's Alfred had been hoping to clinch an Olympic sprint double after her dazzling win in the 100m on Saturday, extending the dominance of Caribbean sprinters in the event.\n\nBut Thomas, the fastest woman in the world this year over 200m, was in no mood to let her date with destiny slip.\n\nThe Harvard-educated sprinter exploded out of the blocks and ran a superb bend to open up a sizeable lead coming into the home straight.\n\nThe American's strength and finishing power never looked like waning as she powered over the line to claim a deserved gold.\n\n- 'Finish strong' -\n\n\"I don't think it could have gone any better,\" Thomas said of her race. \"My coach told me the only thing I need is to get the lead and finish strong and I did that.\n\n\"I couldn't tell you where my competitors were in that race because I locked out and when I crossed the line that's the only thing I can remember.\"\n\nThe win marks a steady rise to the top for Thomas, who first arrived on the international scene in 2021 with a victory at the US trials.\n\nShe backed that up with a bronze medal at the Olympics this year and after struggling with a hamstring injury in 2022, bagged a silver medal in the 200m at last year's World Championships in Budapest.\n\nThis season she signalled her readiness to finally land gold at a major championships with a string of impressive displays, which included a win in the London Diamond League meeting just before the Olympics where once again she finished ahead of Alfred.\n\nThomas added that she had also taken inspiration from compatriot Noah Lyles' razor-thin victory in the men's 100m on Sunday.\n\n\"It really was so inspiring\" she said of Lyles win. \"Hearing Noah go after what he wanted and take it -- I knew if I was in any position in this race I could still go after it and take it if I had to.\"\n\nSilver medallist Alfred had no complaints at her defeat.\n\n\"I'm tired, long five days,\" she said. \"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight. I feel good, no complaints at all.\n\n\"This means a lot.

If I didn't get this gold medal today I don't know what I would have done.\n\n'I'm really in disbelief because having an Olympic gold medal is something in my wildest dreams. But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it.\n\n'This has been six years in the making, head down, working hard, going to really hard meets, pushing yourself, and now it's here and I've done it.

'My coach told me the only thing I need is to get the lead and finish strong and I did that.\n\n'I couldn't tell you where my competitors were in that race because I locked out and when I crossed the line that's the only thing I can remember.'\n\nThe win marks a steady rise to the top for Thomas, who first arrived on the international scene in 2021 with a victory at the US trials.\n\nShe backed that up with a bronze medal at the Olympics this year and after struggling with a hamstring injury in 2022, bagged a silver medal in the 200m at last year's World Championships in Budapest.\n\nThis season she signalled her readiness to finally land gold at a major championships with a string of impressive displays, which included a win in the London Diamond League meeting just before the Olympics where once again she finished ahead of Alfred.\n\nThomas added that she had also taken inspiration from compatriot Noah Lyles' razor-thin victory in the men's 100m on Sunday.\n\n'It really was so inspiring' she said of Lyles win. 'Hearing Noah go after what he wanted and take it -- I knew if I was in any position in this race I could still go after it and take it if I had to.'\n\nSilver medallist Alfred had no complaints at her defeat.\n\n'I'm tired, long five days,' she said.

In the process, she has claimed her Olympic gold medal. Thomas led from the gun and finished with daylight between her and silver medalist Julien Alfred of Saint Lucia, who won 100m gold on Saturday.\n\nThomas is joined on the medal podium by U.S. teammate Brittany Brown, who earned bronze for her first Olympic medal.\n\nThomas' win comes after a string of falling short of the podium in major title races. At the Tokyo Olympics, she took bronze. In her next major title race, 2023 Worlds, it was silver for Thomas. Now in Paris, she's got her gold.\n\nBut this year in Paris, especially with the withdrawal of Jamaican rival Shericka Jackson, Thomas entered as the prohibitive favorite -- and Thomas knew it.\n\n\"There's definitely some added pressure going into this Olympics,\" Thomas told NBC Olympics in April. \"Once you've already had success, people are kind of waiting for you to mess up.\"\n\nWith the expectations fully mounted, Thomas didn't mess up, not even close. She delivered gold, her first at a major global title race.\n\nIt's also the 14th gold for the U.S. in the Olympic women's 200m, which breaks a 13-13 tie with Jamaica for the most in history (no Jamaican earned a 200m medal this year for the first time since 1976). And Thomas is the first American since Allyson Felix in 2012 to strike gold in the women's event.\n\nThe 27-year-old has endeared herself to the American public not just with her command of the track, but also with her extraordinary public health work. She volunteers weekly at a Volunteer Healthcare Clinic (VHC) in Austin, Texas, which provides primary care to children and adults without access to such care.\n\n\"A lot of people can say they want to do things, but Gabby is actually doing this work at a high level,\" said the clinic's Director of Volunteer Services, Laura Hurst. \"I don't think you can underestimate the power of what one person can do.\"\n\nWith a Harvard degree in neurobiology and global health, plus a master's in epidemiology from the University of Texas, Thomas is a safe bet to impact public health for decades after she stops running professionally.\n\n\"It's so fulfilling because we're actually making a direct impact and these are people who really do have a need for healthcare,\" Thomas said.", "source": {"uri":

Team USA secured gold and bronze, with St. Lucia's 100m champion Julien Alfred capturing silver. This is the first time the U.S. has won gold in this race since Allyson Felix won in London back in 2012.\n\nWith two-time 200m world champion Shericka Jackson pulling out of the race because of an injury, all eyes were on Thomas and Alfred, who was hoping to capture the double quest to win both the 100m and 200m distances.\n\nThomas clocked in at a remarkable time of 21.83, with Alfred close behind at 22.08, and USA's Brittany Brown rounding out in third at 22.20. The Harvard graduate was a favorite to win and looked cool, calm, and collected as she sprinted to victory around the track in front of a crowd of almost 80,000 fans. As soon as she crossed the finish, you could see the visceral and emotional reaction to her win.\n\nThis is the third Olympic medal for Thomas, who earned a bronze in Tokyo for the 200m and silver from the 4\u00d7100 relay team. You can cheer on Thomas later this week as she is slated to run with Sha'Carri Richardson in the 4\u00d7100 relay again on Friday. In addition, she might also be a contender in the 4\u00d7400 relay final on Saturday.\n\nA gold medal in the 200m has been a hard-earned goal for Thomas. At the 2023 World Championships, she placed second. According to USA Today, during the track and field Olympic trials in Eugene, O.R., Thomas was trying to decide if she should compete in both the 200m and 400m, \"but decided to focus on the 200 because she was so intent on winning gold in Paris. After she won the 200 title, she said she had no doubts she's made the right decision.\"\n\nIronically enough, Thomas' mother Jennifer Randall, who is an education professor at the University of Michigan, said she \"had to prod Thomas to run when her daughter was younger.\" But the rest is history. During her junior year of high school is Massachusetts, she \"started locking in on track and field...Harvard recruited her to run in the 100m, 200m, and do the long jump and triple jump. In 2018, Thomas won the 200-m NCAA title, Time reports.\n\nAfter graduation, Thomas headed to Austin, T.X. to train for the Tokyo Olympics. Of note, her qualifying time of 21.61 seconds during the 2021 trials is second only to track legend Florence Griffith Joyner.\n\nBut Thomas has also been putting in work off of the track. After Tokyo, she graduated with her master's degree from the University of Texas in 2023, \"where she wrote about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology.\" Thomas says, \"African Americans were more likely to have issues with sleep for social reasons and biological reasons...It led them to have lower life expectancy.\" In addition, Thomas currently works at the Volunteer Healthcare Clinic offering \"medical services to uninsured patients\" where she serves as \"director of the hypertension program.\"\n\nIn addition to her incredible academic and athletic accolades -- Thomas has been racking up endorsements with the likes of New Balance and Sephora, in addition to being named as the \"face of Alexis Ohanian's new women's track event ATHLOS.\"\n\nNow the U.S. has five gold medals in track and field, with no other country even coming close and having more than two. In total, the U.S. has rounded up 16 medals in track and field, with Kenya and Jamaica tied at second, having four each.", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"},

If I didn't get this gold medal today I don't know what I would have done.\n\n\"I'm really in disbelief because having an Olympic gold medal is something in my wildest dreams. But at the same time I know how hard I've fought for it.\n\n\"This has been six years in the making, head down, working hard, going to really hard meets, pushing yourself, and now it's here and I've done it. This is the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\nSt. Lucia's Alfred had been hoping to clinch an Olympic sprint double after her dazzling win in the 100m on Saturday, extending the dominance of Caribbean sprinters in the event.\n\nBut Thomas, the fastest woman in the world this year over 200m, was in no mood to let her date with destiny slip.\n\nThe Harvard-educated sprinter exploded out of the blocks and ran a superb bend to open up a sizeable lead coming into the home straight.\n\nThe American's strength and finishing power never looked like waning as she powered over the line to claim a deserved gold.\n\n- 'Finish strong' -\n\n\"I don't think it could have gone any better,\" Thomas said of her race. \"My coach told me the only thing I need is to get the lead and finish strong and I did that.\n\n\"I couldn't tell you where my competitors were in that race because I locked out and when I crossed the line that's the only thing I can remember.\"\n\nThe win marks a steady rise to the top for Thomas, who first arrived on the international scene in 2021 with a victory at the US trials.\n\nShe backed that up with a bronze medal at the Olympics this year and after struggling with a hamstring injury in 2022, bagged a silver medal in the 200m at last year's World Championships in Budapest.\n\nThis season she signalled her readiness to finally land gold at a major championships with a string of impressive displays, which included a win in the London Diamond League meeting just before the Olympics where once again she finished ahead of Alfred.\n\nThomas added that she had also taken inspiration from compatriot Noah Lyles' razor-thin victory in the men's 100m on Sunday.\n\n\"It really was so inspiring\" she said of Lyles win. \"Hearing Noah go after what he wanted and take it -- I knew if I was in any position in this race I could still go after it and take it if I had to.\"\n\nSilver medallist Alfred had no complaints at her defeat.\n\n\"I'm tired, long five days,\" she said. \"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight. I feel good, no complaints at all.\n\n\"This means a lot. First Olympics, to go back with gold and silver, I can't ask for more than that.\"\n\nrcw/dj\n\nMore from this section\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law Firm\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief Executive Officer", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_woollard@kulr8.com", "name": "Rob Woollard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Thomas_(Emmerdale)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Thomas (Emmerdale)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2012_Summer_Paralympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyson_Felix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allyson Felix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anniversary_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anniversary Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/18/9183258f-a1c6-512e-8cb8-4190b5d0c559/66b28497a46bf.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

She delivered an impressive performance, finishing the race in 21.83 seconds.\n\nReflecting on her race, Thomas expressed her disbelief and excitement, saying, \"Honestly, I kind of blanked out for all of it, I can't even remember what I was doing, I just wanted to win. The only moment I remember was crossing the finish line and being in disbelief, that was it.\"\n\nJulien Alfred, who became the first athlete from Saint Lucia to win an Olympic medal by securing gold in the 100 metres on Saturday, was initially the fastest out of the blocks. However, she ultimately finished second with a time of 22.08 seconds. Brittany Brown, another American athlete, took bronze with a time of 20.20 seconds.\n\nAlfred expressed her satisfaction with her performance, despite the challenges she faced over the five-day competition. \"I'm tired. Long five days,\" Alfred told reporters. \"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight. I feel good, no complaints at all. This means a lot. First Olympics, to go back with gold and silver, I can't ask for more than that.\"\n\nThomas entered the Paris Olympics with the fastest time of the season, clocking 21.78 seconds. She made a strong impression during the semi-finals, where she effortlessly pulled away from her competitors in the last 50 metres, finishing with a smile in 21.86 seconds. Her preparation and determination paid off as she confidently rang the track-side victory bell, draped in the American flag.\n\nThe 200 metres final at Stade de France began with a captivating light show, setting the stage for Thomas's memorable performance. Despite her impressive achievement, Thomas described the race as a blur, stating, \"I have actually never forgotten a race so quickly in my life. I was just on autopilot, but I practiced for it, everything that I did up until that moment was to prepare myself to run that race, so I just knew how to do it, so I did it.\"\n\nThomas, who holds a degree in neurobiology from Harvard and a Master's in public health from the University of Texas, demonstrated not only her athletic prowess but also her dedication and discipline. Her victory was further highlighted by the absence of Jamaica's reigning world champion Shericka Jackson, who withdrew from the competition due to an injury sustained in the heats.\n\nWith her Olympic gold medal win, Gabby Thomas has solidified her place among the world's elite sprinters, fulfilling her promise to achieve global success.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shericka_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shericka Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "50 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Gappy-Thomas-11722991168-0/Gappy-Thomas-11722991168-0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday night, the American won the 200 meters at the Paris Olympics in 21.83 seconds.\n\nJulien Alfred of Saint Lucia, who won the women's 100 meters three days ago, took silver in 22.08 seconds, while American Brittany Brown rounded out the podium in bronze (22.20 seconds).\n\nThomas got off to a strong start, and came off the turn with a significant lead; heading down the home stretch, Alfred simply could not gain ground. From there, it was a race for bronze, with first-time Olympian Brown edging out Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita.\n\nThe third American athlete, NCAA 100- and 200-meter champion McKenzie Long, finished seventh in 22.42 seconds.\n\nThomas, 27, the silver medalist in the 200 at last year's World Championships, put together a nearly-perfect season in the 200 meters. In May, she got off to a slow start at the Los Angeles Grand Prix, placing an uncharacteristic sixth. But Thomas assured her fans on social media that it was nothing to worry about, saying she was in the middle of a tough training block.\n\nIt would be the only 200 she would lose throughout the season.\n\nAt the Olympic Trials in June, Thomas held off the field in the final 50 meters, winning in 21.81. Three weeks later, she won the London Diamond League in a meet record of 21.82, taking down Alfred and Asher-Smith.\n\nWhile Thomas owned the fastest 200 time in the world coming into the meet, which she set at the Trials, she wasn't considered the clear-cut favorite. Instead, Shericka Jackson -- last year's world champion from Jamaica -- was expected to defend her global title. But Jackson, ultimately, would not run a step at the Olympics.\n\nOn July 31, Jackson announced she would skip the 100 meters to focus only on the 200, noting that she injured her hamstring in a tuneup race. But five days later, just before the 200 preliminaries were set to start, she withdrew from the 200 as well.\n\nIn recent years, Thomas has become one of the most popular track and field athletes in the world, in part, to her pursuits away from running. Thomas, who has a master's degree in public health and epidemiology, volunteers at a hypertension intervention program at a health clinic in Austin, Texas, and she's expressed interest in working in healthcare administration after she retires from track.\n\nShe also has a vested interest in growing women's sports. She's spearheading, along with Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, the Athlos track meet -- a women's only competition in September that is offering sizable prize money.", "source": {"uri":

If I want to be a great athlete, if I want to be amongst the names like Sanya, Allyson, Carmelita, Dawn, I have to compete under pressure and accept that's part of it.\"\n\nThe time to let her feet back up those words arrived at last on Tuesday night in front of another enthusiastic crowd at France's largest stadium. Thomas emerged from the Stade de France tunnel just before the start of the Olympic 200 meters final, raising her arms in the air and smiling on the way to her starting block in lane 7.\n\nOne lane to Thomas' right was St. Lucia's Julien Alfred, the 100 meters champion who bested Sha'Carri Richardson and captured her Caribbean nation's first-ever medal. One lane to Thomas' left was fellow American Brittany Brown, who arrived in Paris in the form of her life and then cruised to victory in her Round 1 and semifinal heats. Those two figured to pose the biggest threat to Thomas after Tokyo Olympic champion Shericka Jackson withdrew due to injury.\n\nIt didn't take long for Thomas to show that nobody was going to keep her from Olympic gold in her signature race. She pulled away from Alfred and Brown rounding the curve and maintained that gap as she streaked toward the finish line.\n\nThomas won Olympic gold in 21.83 seconds, placing her hands on her head in disbelief as she crossed the finish line and then draping an American flag over her shoulders. Alfred placed second in 22.08 to win her second medal in three days -- and her country's second medal ever. Brown finished third in 22.20, giving the U.S. two runners on the podium..", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shericka_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shericka Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QggJKCKNk3gDgA7yMLxPmw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/5a22d0a0-542c-11ef-acf5-9dc02b03970d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Rather than competing in both the 200- and 400-meter races (because, of course, she can do both), the track star told USA Today at the time that she would focus only on the 200-meter in hopes of bringing home her first gold medal at the Paris Olympics. On Tuesday night in Stade de France, Thomas did just that, winning the women's 200-meter final in front of a crowd of more than 77,000 fans. Her face crossing the finish line showed instant joy and relief with happy tears in tow. The 27-year-old said she wanted nothing less than gold, and boy, did she deliver.\n\nThomas clinched her long-sought-after gold medal, finishing in 21.83 seconds, leading Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred (22.08) and fellow Team USA athlete Brittany Brown (22.20). The win marks Thomas's third Olympic medal; at just 24 years old, she took home the bronze in the 200m final and silver in the 4x100 relay at her last Olympics outing in Tokyo. Also a graduate of Harvard, Thomas is now the first American to secure gold in the women's 200m since Allyson Felix, her personal hero, in 2012.\n\nIn case you needed any additional reasons to love her, Thomas studied neurobiology, has a master's degree in epidemiology, and volunteers at a clinic for the uninsured in Texas, according to Front Office Sports.

Fellow American Brittney Brown took bronze behind them in a time of 22.20 seconds.\n\nThe win never looked in doubt for Thomas.

It's the fourth gold medal for Team USA athletics this Games; Noah Lyles won gold in the men's 100-meter, while Ryan Crouser came in first in the men's shot put.

That relay team, which includes 100-meter sprint silver medalist Sha'Carri Richardson, will look for another medal in Paris later this week.\n\nNow entering the peak of her athletic career, Thomas is winning big after already making a significant difference in her sport. She helped Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian come up with the idea for a new women's-only track and field event, the 776 Invitational, which will debut in September.\n\nAt that upcoming track meet, all participants will take home prize money, with $60,000 for the winner, $25,000 for the runner-up, $10,000 for third, $8,000 for fourth, $5,000 for fifth, and $2,500 for sixth. Compare that with the Diamond League, track and field's premier professional competition, which typically pays $10,000 to race winners and $30,000 at its season-ending event.\n\nThomas earns $50,000 from World Athletics for her gold medal in Paris, and another $37,500 from Team USA.\n\nNew Balance has sponsored Thomas since 2018, after she graduated from Harvard with a degree in neurobiology. As a professional, she moved to Austin, and last year completed a master's degree in epidemiology from the University of Texas.\n\nSince the Olympics began, Thomas has been capitalizing on her growing social media presence.

Please try again later.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Here is how a star was born: With an explosion. Early steps packed with power, and every long stride exuding grace. There was determination and purpose. It happened fast -- don't dare blink -- and at exactly the right time, that star started to sparkle, bright enough to make an entire stadium glow and a city swoon.\n\nYes, Paris is the City of Lights, but none shined brighter than Gabby Thomas at Stade de France, where the 27-year old sprinter completed a years-long journey, covering the final short stretch of it in all of 21.83 seconds to win Olympic gold.\n\nShe had envisioned every step and had a plan for each piece of the 200-meter race. With Thomas, there's always a plan, always a concrete goal, whether it's an Olympic title or an Ivy League education. She hadn't thought about the end, though.\n\n\"There's no way to really prepare for that,\" she would explain later.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nGet the latest updates on the 2024 Olympics\n\n(Washington Post illustration)\n\nTrack all the Paris Olympic medal counts country by country, and see the breakdown of medals by U.S. athletes. Get live updates from Paris and keep up with the latest by signing up for The Sports Moment: Olympics Edition.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nSo when Thomas finally reached the finish line, a full 0.25 seconds ahead of anyone else, she broke down. There were tears and a silent scream. Her hands went to her head, and she seemed to be in disbelief.\n\n\"It was so many emotions flooding me. Happiness, joy, pride, disbelief, shock, all at once,\" she said. \"It was the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\nThomas is no newcomer or fresh face. She won bronze at the Tokyo Games and has a target on her back every time she steps on the track. But an Olympic gold in the 200, the first for the United States since Allyson Felix in 2012, catapulted Thomas into a new stratosphere. A star was born in Paris -- for the sport, for U.S. track and field, and for everyone who caught a glimpse of that speeding blur of light flying around the curve.\n\n\"She's the female that needs to be in front of the track world,\" said McKenzie Long, the 24-year old American who had a good view of Thomas from Lane 2. \"She's that type of female that everybody should look up to and want to be like, you know?\"\n\nThomas's curriculum vitae is already packed, so it's not yet clear where this latest accomplishment fits. Two-time Olympian, of course. But don't forget her neurobiology degree from Harvard. Or her master's in public health from the University of Texas.\n\nRunning wasn't always the most important thing. In fact, it often wasn't. There were times in college she wanted to hang up the spikes. Even after turning professional, she emailed her agent to say she was done. But she couldn't walk away.\n\n\"Track is not exactly a fun activity in itself,\" she explained late Tuesday night. \"You're literally running and it's hard and it's painful. ... But I found the beauty in it. I found the love in it. I just love chasing goals, I love chasing my dreams, I love moments like this where everything comes together.\"\n\nThomas trains in Austin with Tonja Buford-Bailey, a three-time Olympic hurdler who won bronze at the 1996 Olympics. Before Tuesday's final, her coach told her that everything Thomas had been through -- every youth meet, every injury, every world championship and every Olympic heat from three years ago -- had equipped her for this, that \"I was prepared, I was mature and I was ready,\" Thomas recalled.\n\nIn the call room before the race, while others reviewed their race plans and locked in mentally, Thomas did 10 burpees, the onerous full-body exercise which is definitely not typical prerace prep.\n\n\"I looked over, I was like, 'Okaaay,'\" said Long.\n\nThat might have been an Olympic first, but Buford-Bailey wanted Thomas to get her heart rate up before stepping out into the stadium. When the gun finally fired, Thomas said, she blacked out. But she knew the plan. Get out fast and take the lead. Don't stop and don't worry about anything around you. As far as Thomas was concerned, she was the only one on the purple track.\n\n\"It's kind of like tunnel vision at that point,\" Thomas said. \"I got out of the blocks and I couldn't tell you where anything was. ... It's the most bizarre feeling when you get into a flow and you get into that energy where nothing matters but the finish line.\"\n\nThomas's lead only grew over the final 20 meters, and when she crossed the finish line, she had put plenty of daylight between herself and Julien Alfred, the 23-year old Saint Lucian sprinter who won gold in the 100 meters on Saturday. Right behind her, winning bronze, was American Brittany Brown, her eyelids glowing with designer eye shadow colors called \"I Am Unbreakable\" and \"I Am Invincible.\"\n\nTuesday's final was missing a couple of the world's top sprinters. Elaine Thompson-Herah, the gold medalist at the last two Olympics, suffered an Achilles injury in June and had to withdraw from the Jamaican trials. And Shericka Jackson, who took gold at the past two world championships and is the second-fastest 200 sprinter ever, withdrew earlier in the week.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that you can't have your reigning world champion competing,\" said Thomas, who still hopes to run in both the 4x100 and 4x400 relays here, \"but I was confident before that and I was confident going into the race.\"\n\nThomas is the latest American champion in one of the sport's marquee events. A golden line connects Wilma Rudolph to Florence Griffith-Joyner to Felix and now to Thomas.\n\n\"I haven't thought about how my life is going to change,\" she said. \"I didn't want to think about that going into the race because it's very overwhelming to think about.\"\n\nBut she knows track is just part of the equation, and that newly-won medal just part of her platform. Long was asked what she admired about Thomas, and she didn't have to think long. She didn't mention Thomas's training, her starts, her acceleration or her closing speed.\n\n\"Her poise,\" Long said. \"She's very much an empowerment woman. She carries a lot of power. You can tell by just how she carries herself.\"\n\nShe's not sure what the future holds exactly, but she wants to be an active role model. She is already involved with an effort to grow the women's side of the sport. Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit co-founder and husband of Serena Williams, is staging the inaugural 776 Invitational in New York in September, a track meet just for women, with Thomas as a headliner.\n\n\"I want young girls to look at us as strong female athletes and feel like they can do it too,\" Thomas said. \"I want them to feel like they're encouraged to go into professional sports, I want them to feel encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter how big or small.\"\n\nThomas believed in hers. The way she sped around the curve, it looked like she was born for it, a shooting star just getting started. No matter how much she planned and dreamed, this radiant night was a lot to take in.\n\n\"You prepare for this moment and you train so hard for this moment and when it actually comes, it's indescribable,\" Thomas said. \"I couldn't believe it. I never would've imagined in my wildest dreams that I would become an Olympic gold medalist. And I am one. I'm still wrapping my head around that.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_maese@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Rick

That relay team, which includes 100-meter sprint silver medalist Sha'Carri Richardson, will look for another medal in Paris later this week.\n\nNow seemingly entering the peak of her athletic career, Thomas is winning big after already making a big difference in her sport. She helped Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian come up with the idea for a new women's-only track and field event, the 776 Invitational, which will debut in September.\n\nAt that upcoming track meet, all participants will take home prize money, with $60,000 for the winner, $25,000 for the runner-up, $10,000 for third, $8,000 for fourth, $5,000 for fifth, and $2,500 for sixth. Compare that with the Diamond League, track and field's premier professional competition, which typically pays $10,000 to race winners and $30,000 at its season-ending event.\n\nThomas earns $50,000 from World Athletics for her gold medal in Paris, and another $37,500 from Team USA.\n\nNew Balance has sponsored Thomas since 2018, after she graduated from Harvard with a degree in neurobiology. As a professional, she moved to Austin, and last year completed a master's degree in epidemiology from the University of Texas.\n\nSince the Olympics began, Thomas has been capitalizing on her growing social media presence. With more than 500,000 followers on Instagram, Thomas has posted ads from Paris for skincare brand Summer Fridays, as well as Omega watches.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Ohanian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_SA", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omega SA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Balance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USATSI_23928221-scaled.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Thomas won with a time of 21.83 seconds; Julien Alfred of St. Lucia finished second, with a time of 22.08, to take silver while Brittany Brown of the U.S. earned bronze with a time of 2.20.\n\nThe U.S. continues to dominate the track-and field-competition. Thomas' victory gives the Americans five golds in the sport: no other country has more than two golds. Cole Hocker added to that haul in a surprise win in the 1500 m earlier Tuesday: in what was supposed to be a two-man duel between Josh Kerr of Great Britain and Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen, Hocker outkicked them both down the stretch, setting a new Olympic record in the process.\n\nOverall, the United States has piled up 16 track-and-field medals so far: Kenya and Jamaica has the second-most medals, with four each overall.\n\nThomas has improved her global standing steadily, winning 200-m bronze in Tokyo, a silver at last year's world championships, and now gold. Her 200-m rival, defending world champion, Shericka Jackson of Jamaica, pulled out of the 100-m and 200-m races in Paris. A hamstring issue had bothered Jackson, but that hasn't been confirmed as the reason for Jackson's withdrawal in the race. Jackson's absence positioned Thomas as the clear favorite. She didn't let the U.S. down.\n\nRead More: Gabby Thomas Was Thrilled With Bronze in Tokyo. Now Only Gold Will Do\n\nThomas' mother, University of Michigan education professor Jennifer Randall, had to prod Thomas to run when her daughter was younger. Thomas started locking in on track and field her junior year of high school in Massachusetts; Harvard recruited her to run in the 100 m, 200 m, and do the long jump and triple jump. In 2018, Thomas won the 200-m NCAA title.\n\nShe moved to Austin after graduation to train for the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the 2021 U.S. Olympic track-and-field trials, Thomas ran 21.61 seconds: only the legendary Florence Griffith Joyner had finished faster.\n\nThomas had announced her arrival. She followed her 200-m bronze in Tokyo with a strong performance in the 4x100 relay, as the U.S team won gold. Off the track, Douglas finished her master's degree in 2023 at the University of Texas, where she wrote about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology. \"African Americans were more likely to have issues with sleep for social reasons and biological reasons,\" she said before the Olympics. \"It led them to have lower life expectancy.\"\n\nRead More: The Inside Story of How Noah Lyles Pulled Off That Incredible 100-M Win\n\nWhen she's not on the track, Thomas works as the director of the hypertension program at the Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, which offers medical services to uninsured patients. She manages volunteers and interacts with patients. This fall, Thomas will be on the card at a women's-only track event sponsored by Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit and founder of the venture-capital fund 776. The 776 Invitational, which will be held in New York City, will give a $60,000 first-place prize for race winners, substantially higher than the leading pro-track circuit offers.\n\nThomas' work at her Games is not yet done, as she still has the relays ahead of her. She could potentially run in the 4x100 final on Friday and the 4x400 final on Saturday.\n\nBut first she'll step on top of the podium, by herself, as 200-m champ.", "source": {"uri": "time.com",

Long five days,\" Alfred told reporters. \"I did feel ready for the 200m tonight. I feel good, no complaints at all. This means a lot. First Olympics, to go back with gold and silver, I can't ask for more than that.\"\n\nThomas arrived in Paris with the world's fastest time this season of 21.78 and made an emphatic statement in Monday's semi-finals when she pulled away from the field with ease over the final 50m to cross the line smiling in 21.86 seconds.\n\nThe race, which kicked off with a dazzling light show at Stade de France, was a blur for Thomas who has a Harvard degree in neurobiology and master's in public health from the University of Texas.\n\n\"I have actually never forgotten a race so quickly in my life,\" said Thomas, who emphatically rang the track-side victory bell cloaked in an American flag.\n\n\"I was just on autopilot, but I practised for it, everything that I did up until that moment was to prepare myself to run that race, so I just knew how to do it, so I did it,\" she said.\n\n\"I was only able to have one bite of the famous croissant cookie you guys have here, so I'm gonna go get one tomorrow.\"\n\nThere was more frustration for British duo Dina Asher-Smith, and Daryll Neita who finished fourth and fifth, with Asher-Smith missing a medal by two hundredths of a second.\n\n\"I just really enjoyed that. I just told myself 'when the gun goes, just run' and whatever happens, happens. It was a great race,\" Asher-Smith said. \"I was so focused on my race, I had no idea where I finished.\"\n\nJamaica's reigning world champion Shericka Jackson withdrew from Sunday's heats due to injury.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 6 Aug 2024, 9:54 PM Last updated: Tue 6 Aug 2024, 10:36 PM", "source": {"uri": "westmeathindependent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Westmeath Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Thomas_(Emmerdale)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Thomas (Emmerdale)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryll_Neita", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daryll Neita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shericka_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shericka Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Asher-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dina Asher-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Luddism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Luddism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=d13c1889-e72d-5614-82a2-c9532cf39fce&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99852&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

choice to double down on her track training.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat paid off big-time in front of a packed house Tuesday, when she came in as a favorite, especially after reigning world champion

The last American to achieve this feat was Allyson Felix in 2012.\n\nThe 27-year-old sprinting sensation surged ahead around the turn and maintained her lead, clocking in at an impressive 21.83 seconds. \"I don't think it could have gone any better,\" Thomas said, visibly ecstatic as she crossed the finish line, her hands on her head in disbelief and joy.\n\nThomas' victory at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games marks a significant milestone, ending a long gap since Felix's win in London. Prior to Felix, the U.S. had not secured gold in the women's 200-meter for four consecutive Olympics. Notable past champions include Gwen Torrence in 1992, Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988, and Valerie Brisco-Hooks in 1984.\n\nInspired by Felix from a young age, Thomas often watched her idol compete while at her grandmother's house. In a pre-Olympics interview with Elle, she dedicated a few words to her idol, \"I internalized your silent confidence and poise and the strength that you had when you ran.\"\n\nShe explained those virtues of Felix, \"It's something I think about all the time when I'm running now. Because of the way you carried yourself, I am also very aware of how I carry myself.\"\n\nThomas' victory was not just a personal triumph but a momentous occasion for American track and field. She bested Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred, who finished at 22.08, and fellow American Brittany Brown, who took bronze with a time of 22.20, earning her first Olympic medal.\n\n\"You can't take a gold medal away. This is all I wanted,\" said Thomas, who is also set to compete in the 4\u00d7100 relay. Reflecting on the immense pressure, she added, \"If I didn't get this gold medal today, I don't know what I would have done.\"\n\nThomas' success is the latest in a series of impressive performances. She won silver in the 200-meter at last year's world championships and earned two medals at the Tokyo Games, taking bronze in the 200-meter and silver in the 4\u00d7100-meter relay.\n\nHer victory follows another inspiring American win: Noah Lyles'thrilling photo-finish in the men's 100-meter dash on Sunday. Thomas expressed her admiration for Lyles, saying, \"It really was so inspiring, hearing Noah go after what he wanted and take it. I knew that if I were in any position in this race, I could still go after it and take it if I had to.\"\n\nGabby Thomas' triumph not only ended a 12-year gold medal drought for the U.S. in the women's 200-meter but also solidified her place as a leading figure in American athletics.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyson_Felix", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allyson Felix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Torrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gwen Torrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Brisco-Hooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valerie Brisco-Hooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Griffith_Joyner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florence Griffith Joyner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/5732c1124c886116e5a1c98dda8491dc/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/08/07/17229826628549.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

By Courtesy of the Ivy League\n\nGabby Thomas '19 soared to victory in the 200 meter sprint at the 2024 Paris Olympics Tuesday, securing Harvard's first Olympic gold medal in track and field and the only track and field gold for the University in over 100 years.\n\nAfter a strong start, Thomas quickly gained ground through the turn and extended her lead in the final 100 meters, finishing in 21.82 seconds, ahead of Julien Alfred of Saint Lucia and teammate Brittany Brown.\n\nThe win marked the first gold for Thomas, who won a bronze medal in the 200 meter race and a silver in the 4 x 1oo meter relay for Team USA at the Tokyo Games.\n\nThe Northampton, Mass. native was the favorite entering the race. Before the Games, she had put up the fastest time this season, running a 21.78 at Olympic Trials and a 21.60 at the 2023 USA Championships -- a personal best and the fourth fastest time ever in the event.\n\nThomas was not without competition though.\n\nJamaican runner Shericka Jackson has been putting in breathtaking time over the last few years -- recording a personal best of 21.41 in the World Athletics Championships in 2023 and beating out Thomas for the gold.\n\nBut minutes before the first round of racing, Jackson dropped out of the 200 meter event, citing a calf cramp from earlier in the month, .\n\nThe focus suddenly narrowed onto Thomas and Julien Alfred -- who had breezed into a gold medal in the 100 meter race the day before.\n\nBoth women led their heats handily -- looking cool and collected as they ran -- and moved on to the semifinals the next day.\n\nThomas secured a spot in the final with a blazing time of 21.86, putting her at the top of the leaderboard during the semifinals, but Alfred won her heat again and recorded the second best time of 21.98.\n\nWhen Alfred and Thomas lined up Tuesday, they were both ready to flex their full potential for the first time in the event at these Games.\n\nThis dominance came as no surprise to anyone who watched Thomas when she competed for the Crimson. Across her three years at Harvard, Thomas was named an All-American seven times. At the 2018 NCAA indoor championships, Thomas became the first athlete in Ivy League history to win an NCAA sprinting championship by setting a then-collegiate record time of 22.38 in the event.\n\nDuring the 2015-16 season, her freshman year, she was named to the first team All-America in the 200m. Additionally, she was chosen as a member of the All-Ivy League first team for a historic seven events that year.\n\nAfter setting both Harvard and Ivy League records in the outdoor 100m, outdoor 200m, and indoor 60m, Thomas competed in the 2016 USA Track & Field Olympic trials and placed sixth overall in the 200m.\n\nIn her sophomore campaign, Thomas continued to turn up the heat. She achieved a new personal best of 11.24 in the 100m and came in third at the NCAA Division I Outdoor Track & Field Championships. Thomas was yet again named to the first team All-Ivy League in several events: 100m, 200m, Long Jump, 4x100m relay, and 4x400m relay. Her strong performances culminated in her earning the honor of U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Northeast Region Women's Track Athlete of the Year.\n\nThomas' coach, Kebba Tolbert, spoke about working with Thomas throughout college -- calling her \"very talented,\" but also \"very, very driven.\"\n\nTolbert said he wanted to help Thomas understand how to use her talent when he coached her and he watched Thomas become a \"student of the sport\" over her four years.\n\n\"I think that paid dividends for years and continues to to this day,\" Tolbert said.\n\nFive years after Thomas graduated, Tolbert says it's exciting to see a former student develop from \"a very good high school athlete to one of the very, very best in the world\"\n\nBut he also noted that despite the \"evolution\" Thomas has gone through to achieve on such a high level, she's managed to keep some things the same.\n\n\"She's still kept her core self intact,\" Tolbert said.\n\nTolbert also spoke about what Thomas' achievements mean to Harvard's track and field team. He said her presence on an international stage is exciting for her former teammates and proves that a Harvard sprinter can be at the top of her sports.\n\n\"To have people in the Olympics doing well shows that the Ivy League is Division I,\" Tolbert said. \"You can come and get an amazing education, to get a world class education, and compete at the highest levels.\"\n\n\"There's no sacrifice,\" he added.\n\nThomas may be the only sprinter from Harvard at the Paris Games, but her achievement comes during an impressive year for Harvard's Olympians.\n\nThomas's gold brings Harvard's total medal count to 10, including 5 gold medals, 2 silver medals, and 3 bronze medals -- the most overall medals since the 1896 Games.

The race wasn't over until it's over. That's how it went.\"\n\nThere will be those who will wonder if the first Olympic women's 200 final without a Jamaican athlete since 1976 would have gone a different way had not both the defending Olympic and reigning world champions been absent due to injury.\n\nThomas was third in the Olympic 200 in Tokyo behind Jamaica's Elaine Thompson-Herah, winner of both the 100 and 200 gold medals in 2021 and the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. Thomas was second to Shericka Jackson, also of Jamaica, at last year's World Championships. Thompson-Herah suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during the spring. Jackson, winner of the 2022 Worlds 200, as well, made it to Paris only to pull out of the 100 and later the 200 because of injury.\n\nBut Thomas had also posted the three fastest times in the world this season, and four of the top five, led by a 21.78 clocking at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore.\n\n\"I have been doing really well in the 200 meters all season,\" Thomas said. \"I wouldn't say that I was relieved when Shericka pulled out. I wish her all the best and it's hard that you can't have your reigning world champion competing but I was confident going into the race.\"\n\nThat confidence had been hard to come by, even for a woman who graduated from Harvard in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in neurobiology, a minor in global health policy, and a citation in French. She juggled her training for last year's Worlds and the Olympics with earning a master's degree in public health from the University of Texas Health Science Center, writing a thesis on racial disparities in sleep disorders and evaluating sleep epidemiology among Black Americans.\n\nShe was inspired to study neurobiology and global health policy by her younger brother Desi, who has autism, and her twin brother Andrew, who went to neuro-feedback therapy for ADHD in high school.\n\nBecause the Ivy League prohibits athletic scholarships, Thomas worked at the university's laundry service to pay her way through school. Several times she considered quitting track.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" she said. \"There were so many points like that. Running track in college, many times I thought I would quit. Many times I wanted my life to go in a different direction.\n\n\"When I went pro, growing pains of joining a pro training group are real. I didn't think I would be cut out for it. I said to my agent, 'I'm done. I'm going to pursue other endeavours.' But it's just part of overcoming challenges.\n\n\"I'm at a point where I'm committed, I love what I do right now and I'm sticking with it. But there were definitely moments where I had my doubts.\"\n\nIn the three years since running in an empty Olympic Stadium in Tokyo because of COVID-19 restrictions, Thomas had thought she had prepared herself for anything in Paris.\n\nThat is until she raced past the finish line.\n\n\"I envisioned this from start to finish,\" she said. \"I've been envisioning it since I made the team back in June. I was not prepared for how I was going to feel when I crossed the line.\n\n\"There's no way to prepare yourself for that.\"", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"},

Fellow American Brittney Brown took bronze behind them in a time of 22.20 seconds.\n\nThe win never looked in doubt for Thomas. Despite the lightning-fast race, she clearly pulled ahead with 100 meters to go, with no chance of anyone catching her.\n\nThe race marked the first Olympic gold for Thomas, who won both a silver and a bronze medal at the Tokyo Games in 2021. It's the fourth gold medal for Team USA athletics this Games; Noah Lyles won gold in the men's 100-meter, while Ryan Crouser came in first in the men's shot put. Valarie Allman won the women's discus throw.\n\nThomas, who also dominated the event's semifinals with a time of 21.86 seconds, has had her eyes on the prize for the past few years, especially after she tore her hamstring ahead of the 2022 World Championships and had to opt out.\n\n\"To be forced to sit that out was very difficult, but it also made me truly appreciate how important track is to me, and how much I want to do this,\" she told PEOPLE in July. \"I'm so thrilled to be going to Paris and to represent Team USA, feeling strong and at my best.\"\n\nThe Harvard University graduate said at the time that bringing home a gold medal \"would mean the world\" to her, and that she was excited to have a cheer squad including her mom, dad and boyfriend in Paris supporting her.\n\n\"In 2021, I was just happy to be there, and it felt a bit unexpected,\" she said. \"Now, I have bigger goals for myself and I am doing everything I can to bring home the gold.

Alfred's rise posed a threat to Thomas' hopes, but the 27-year-old looked like someone who could come back in four years and compete for gold again.\n\nAs it turns out, Thomas comes from an impressive background that makes it no surprise she has turned in such a remarkable career on the track. Here's a closer look at Thomas' family.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS\n\nFull Olympics schedule | How to watch in USA | Meet NBC's broadcasters\n\nThomas' father, Desmond Thomas, enjoyed a football career at Duke University. He had a brief career as a defensive back, appearing in games for the Blue Devils in 1995, and now lives in Chicago.\n\nDesmond is originally from Jamaica, which produced 2016 and 2020 200-meter gold medalist Elaine Thompson-Herah. There were no Jamaican sprinters in the 200-meter final on Tuesday, an unusual circumstance, but the island nation can claim that little piece of pride with Thomas' victory.\n\nThomas' mother, Jennifer Randall, isn't an athlete, but she has had an extremely impressive career in her own field. Randall currently works as the Dunn Family Endowed Professor of Psychometrics and Test Development at the University of Michigan's school of education.\n\nRandall graduated from Emory University with a PhD in 2007 and previously worked as a professor at UMass Amherst.\n\nThomas said before the Olympics that her mother helped inspire her to work hard for her goals. \"I think watching her as I was growing up and how hard she worked, that's impacted me in ways that I probably can't even recognize,\" she told Olympics.com.\n\nThomas explained that her mother's fortitude to go from a single mother with little money to someone with a PhD and a successful career in education showed her that \"anything is possible.\"\n\nRandall's work appears to have inspired her daughter in more ways than one. Thomas graduated from Harvard University after studying neurobiology, and she received a master's degree in epidemiology from the University of Texas in 2023 all while training to become an Olympic gold medalist.\n\nMORE: Details on Gabby Thomas' education from Texas, Harvard\n\nThe accomplishments don't stop there for the Thomas family, even if Thomas' boyfriend isn't officially part of the family. The star sprinter is dating former Yale QB Spencer McManes, with their relationship spanning nearly two years.\n\nMcManes didn't see the field much at all with the Bulldogs, but just getting into Yale is an achievement in itself. McManes, who was raised in Georgia, now works for a data privacy software company and recently started his own line of non-alcoholic drinks.\n\nThomas has a twin brother, Andrew, who works as a graphic designer. She also has three younger siblings named Desi, Tyler and Kim.\n\nThomas was born Dec. 7, 1996 in Atlanta. In 2007, she moved to Florence, Mass., and attended Williston Northampton School, where she became a record-setting track star before attending Harvard.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com",

Instead, she crashed in the room of her boyfriend, Spencer McManes, in Paris outside the confines of the athlete space.\n\n\"She needed some air-conditioning,\" said McManes, moments after Thomas became the first American woman since Allyson Felix a dozen years ago to win the Olympic 200.\n\nThomas woke up Tuesday morning, said McManes, with a lot of emotions. \"It was just so intense,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say it was anxiety. It was more like excitement, weight. You feel the weight of it.\" With her primary rival, defending 200-m world champion Shericka Jackson of Jamaica, having withdrawn from the event, Thomas found herself the favorite.\n\nRead More: Gabby Thomas Was Thrilled With Bronze in Tokyo. Now Only Gold Will Do\n\nThey discussed, analytically, how to handle these feelings: it's probably worth reminding fans here that Thomas graduated from Harvard, where she majored in neurobiology and global health. McManes played football at Yale. They decided to embrace the moment. Don't deny it was a big deal. Recognize the excitement and the nervousness. That's all part of the program.\n\nAnd they had to eat breakfast at the same place they've visited a few times in Paris. Thomas had to have her favorite item: an omelet.\n\nThe approach worked wonders on Tuesday night, as Thomas held off the Olympic 100-m champion, Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, and crossed the finish line in 21.83 seconds. \"I still don't know what time I ran,\" Thomas told reporters following the race. Someone informed her. \"OK,\" she said. She just cared about the win.\n\nHer coach, Tonja Buford-Bailey, knew Thomas had it 80 m into the sprint. At that point, she lifted her arms into the air. \"What makes her special, I love having an athlete that just doesn't take this too seriously and is just able to keep herself calm,\" says Buford-Bailey. \"We were just laughing it up in the warm-up area right before.\" They cheered as American Cole Hocker won a surprise gold in the men's 1,500 m. Shortly before she was introduced onto the track, Thomas did 10 burpees. \"I need to keep my heart rate up,\" she said, \"It is really embarrassing, but clearly works.\"\n\nThomas swears she didn't realize she had won the race until she crossed the line. \"It's the most bizarre feeling when you get into a flow and you get into that kind of energy where nothing matters but the finish line,\" she said. \"I wasn't thinking about anything.\" And where did the reaction -- which should become a living, breathing poster for Olympics glory -- come from?\n\nRead More: The Inside Story of How Noah Lyles Pulled Off That Incredible 100-M Win\n\n\"I did not expect to feel how I felt when I crossed that line,\" said Thomas. \"You prepare for this moment, and you train so hard for this moment, when it actually comes, it's indescribable, and I couldn't believe it. I mean, I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams that I would become an Olympic gold medalist. And I am one, and I'm still kind of wrapping my head around that.\"\n\nThomas, very intentionally, knocked out any suggestion that this victory was anything less than stellar and deserved due to Jackson's absence. \"I have been doing really well in the 200 m all season,\" she said. \"So I wouldn't say that I was relieved when she got pulled out. I wish her all the best. And it's unfortunate that you can't have your reigning world champion competing. But I was confident before that and I was confident going into the race.\"\n\nSome Olympic champions grew up passionate about their sport from a young age. Sweden's Mondo Duplantis, for example, started pole vaulting in his Lafayette, La., backyard when he was around 4 years old: he broke his own world record, for a ninth time, on Monday. Thomas wasn't one of those champions. \"My mom heavily encouraged, almost forced me into it when I was in high school, because she knew I was fast,\" Thomas said. \"I grew up playing other sports like soccer.\" Why the aversion to the suggestions of her mom, University of Michigan education professor Jennifer Randall, that she take up sprinting? \"Track is not exactly a fun activity in itself,\" said Thomas. \"You're literally running and it's hard and it's painful.\"\n\nBy junior year of high school, however, she started to appreciate the goal-setting aspects of the sport. Run this time, finish in this position. At Harvard, the demands of school and track and field made her think about quitting. Thomas, who now has a master's degree in public health, had ambitions beyond sports.\n\nShe still decided to turn pro after graduating from Harvard in 2019. Thomas moved to Austin to join a training group. She suffered through more growing pains. \"There are a lot of egos, there are just a lot of moving parts, a lot of things going on,\" she said. \"I did think that I was going to be cut out for it. I told my agent that I'm done. I wrote an email saying I'm done running professionally and I'm going to go pursue other endeavors of my life.\"\n\nShe's in a far different place now. Balance has helped. She's continued to pursue her passion for public health, volunteering, for example, seven to 10 hours a week for an Austin clinic that provides services for uninsured patients. This spring, she arranged for her sponsor, New Balance, to donate shoes for hypertension patients that she and a team of volunteers help look after. The facility, the Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, hosted a watch party for the 200 m on Tuesday. A group of 15 to 20 staffers, doctors, volunteers, and patients gathered to cheer her on.\n\n\"Gabby is very dedicated,\" Marci Roe, executive director of the Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, told TIME in a telephone conversation after the race. She calls Thomas an A-level volunteer. She puts in the real work. She's not serving the clinic to brandish her resume or score PR points. \"She cares deeply about helping others,\" says Roe. \"She has the education in public health and wants to put it to good use.\"\n\nThomas believes her involvement in advanced academics and other activities has helped keep her fire for track and field burning. Now she has a chance for two more gold medals at these Paris Games. She says she \"expects to\" run both the 4x100 on Friday and the 4x400 Saturday.\n\n\"I found the beauty in it,\" she said. \"I found a love in it. I just love chasing goals. I love chasing my dreams. I love moments like this, where everything kind of comes together.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Thomas_(Emmerdale)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Thomas (Emmerdale)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shericka_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shericka Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyson_Felix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allyson Felix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Hocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Hocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonja_Buford-Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonja Buford-Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Balance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_vault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pole vault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Thomas is an excellent turn runner and made up much of the stagger on Alfred during the turn, coming off ahead of Alfred. Thomas immediately gained a significant lead and held it all the way through the line, beating Alfred for gold by nearly two-tenths of a second.

Many believed the race would serve as little more than a coronation for Sha'Carri Richardson. In the end, they were mistaken. Thomas took home the crown and punched her ticket to Paris, hoping to lay waste on her global competition just as she did to her domestic counterparts a few months earlier.\n\nThomas finally got that chance during Tuesday's 200m final. In a matter of seconds, Thomas left her foes ambling in her dust, striding beyond 100m gold medalist Julien Alfred to pick up the first piece of Olympic golden ore in her epic career.\n\nThomas cruised to a fairly uncontested victory, with neither Alfred nor third-place Brittany Brown climbing within .20 seconds of her orbit.\n\nThomas wasn't racing her opponents. She was racing ghosts of American sprint royalty past, including seven-time Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix.\n\nFelix may not hold a world record, but her history of success, particularly in the Olympics' individual events, knows few peers. Thomas strives to be one of them. It's unclear whether she's done enough to warrant that title at present.\n\nWho is the better sprinter across 200m, Gabby Thomas or Allyson Felix? The Sporting News takes you through the fact and fiction regarding Thomas and Felix's legacy in the 200m.\n\nWhen Thomas races in the 200m, she's not just competing against her fellow competitors. She's also chasing shadows of sprinters past, including former American standout -- and fellow Olympic gold medalist -- Allyson Felix.\n\nFelix hung up her spikes after the 2022 season, ending her career with a World Championship in the 4x400m relay. Her impact still lingers on record books, however, particularly in the 200m event she made her signature throughout her career.\n\nThe seven-time Olympic gold medalist owns one of the fastest times across 200m, recording a career-best 21.69s reading during the 2012 Olympic trials. And yet, she can't touch Thomas' personal best showing in the same apparatus; Thomas clocked in at 21.60s during the US Track and Field Championships.\n\nThe duo sit fairly close in the world rankings, with Thomas posting the fourth-fastest time in history. Felix sits in eighth, by comparison. Both are some ways behind Florence Joyner-Griffith's storied mark of 21.54s during the 1988 Olympics.\n\nBEST U.S. OLYMPIANS\n\nTop 33 rankings | Simone Biles | Katie Ledecky | Jesse Owens\n\nHere is how Thomas and Felix's best individual event, the 200m, stacks up against one another.\n\nWhen it comes to Olympic medals, the advantage lies with Felix, who took part in an otherworldly five Olympic Games throughout her career.

She does that for every competition, and the image always ends with her arms thrust in the air, celebrating another victory. But not this time.\n\n\"I could not see that moment when I crossed the line,\" she said. \"My mind blanked out.\"\n\nShe has oriented her whole life about her dream of becoming an Olympic champion. But she never quite managed to dream about being an Olympic champion.\n\nSo when it happened-when she burst through the line in 21.83 seconds, a full quarter of a second ahead of St. Lucia's Julien Alfred, who won gold in the women's 100 meters on Saturday, and 0.37 seconds ahead of fellow American Brittany Brown-Thomas, 27, found herself completely unprepared for the emotions that rushed through her.\n\n\"You prepare for this moment, and you train so hard for this moment, but when it actually comes, it's indescribable,\" she said. But she tried anyway: \"It was the happiest moment of my life. I felt very proud of myself. I felt very grateful for my community-my team, my coach, my family, my agents, everyone-and just immense love and joy.\"\n\nShe flung her arms into the air and her mouth dropped open. She burst into tears. She hugged Brown and their other teammate, McKenzie Long, who finished seventh. Thomas jogged to the edge of the track and collected the American flag that she then draped around her shoulders. She rang the Paris 2024 bell that will hang in the Notre-Dame cathedral when it reopens in December after a closure of more than five years due to repairs from a fire. She hugged her mother, Jennifer Randall. Thomas remembered very little of it afterward.\n\nEspecially once reigning world champion Shericka Jackson, of Jamaica, withdrew on Sunday, reportedly due to injury, Thomas was the gold medal favorite. And anyone watching knew by halfway through that she would win. But she wasn't watching. She always tries to achieve perfect focus during a race, but she does not always get there. On Tuesday, she did. \"It's the most bizarre feeling when you get into a flow and you get into that energy where nothing matters but getting to the finish line,\" she said. \"I wasn't thinking about anything but getting to the finish line.\"\n\nAchieving that focus was harder than she had expected. Thomas's talent snuck up on her: Only midway through her time at Harvard did she learn that \"professional runner\" was a job, and that she might have a chance at it. She raced at Olympic trials in 2021 mostly for the experience; she ran a 21.61, then the third-fastest time ever recorded. (\"I am still in shock,\" she said afterward. \"I cannot believe I put up that time.\") In Tokyo, where there were no fans and no expectations, she shocked herself by winning bronze in the 200 meters and gold in the 4X100 relay.\n\nBut in 2023, she took silver at the world championships in the 200 meters and gold in the 4X100. In June, she won the Olympic trials in the 200 meters in 21.81 seconds, nearly a tenth of a second ahead of second place. Suddenly, everyone was looking at her. There are elements of that platform she likes: more attention on her work at an Austin health clinic for people without insurance; more inspiration for young Black girls who might not realize they can do anything. She choked up when informed that Long, 24, had said of her, \"She's the type of female that should be in front of the track world. She's the type of female that everybody should look up to and want to be like.\" But the spotlight can be blinding.\n\n\"It's a lot more fun to run when people aren't expecting things of you, that's for sure,\" Thomas said. \"It's a win-win: If you do well, then great. If you don't do well, hey, you had the experience. Coming off of the Tokyo Olympics, my life definitely changed. In every race that I ran, there were a lot of eyeballs on me. There were a lot of expectations, and that was definitely a lot more pressure, and I had to adapt. And that's what all the best athletes do.\"\n\nStill, it was one thing to adapt to a crowd of 36,000 people-mostly rabid track fans-for last year's world championships in Budapest. It was something different altogether when she walked into the Olympic Village last week.\n\n\"I remember thinking, I don't know how people can deal with the amount of pressure that we're about to put on ourselves as athletes,\" she said. \"Here at the Paris Olympics, there are so many people in the stands. This is a new age of social media where everyone's watching us and [doing] commentary. And I was like, I don't know how we're going to do this. But you kind of have to just step up to the plate and do it. And that's what separates good athletes from great athletes.\"\n\nShe has two more chances to hone that mentality this week. She said she hopes and expects to run the 4X100, on Friday, and the 4X400, on Saturday. Especially if Jackson and teammate Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who withdrew from the 100 meters due to injury, remain out, the U.S. has a good chance to medal in those events, too.\n\nThen Thomas will have to decide what comes next. She admitted on Tuesday that she is probably not ready for how her life will change now that she is an Olympic champion. \"I didn't want to think about that going into the race, because it's very overwhelming,\" she said. But she has spent her whole life chasing down goals-that undergrad degree from Harvard, her master's in public health at the University of Texas, the gold medal she will receive at Wednesday's ceremony-and she expects she will come up with something else soon. Maybe she will get her Ph.D., as her mother has been suggesting with decreasing patience. She will likely take aim at the Los Angeles Games, in 2028. And beyond that?\n\nThomas knows her future will be great. She just can't quite picture it yet.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Gabby Thomas Is Finally Living in the Moment As a Gold Medalist.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com",

I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams that I would become an Olympic gold medalist, and I am one. I'm still kind of wrapping my head around that. It was the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\nIt was like nothing she'd ever imagined. It was exactly as she'd imagined it.\n\nTo watch Gabby Thomas run a sprint is to watch fluidity in motion. She moves with these long, purposeful strides, nary an extraneous movement allowed. Every step is planned with precision.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night, every step was executed with perfection. As if scripted from the moment she returned from Tokyo three years ago with an individual bronze medal, a relay silver medal, and a wealth of invaluable experience, Thomas peaked at precisely the right time.\n\nBut to understand what got Gabby Thomas to the point of running a gold-medal-winning sprint was to watch determination in motion. This was no Hollywood script. As great as Tokyo was, the version of the Thomas who arrived in Japan was a wide-eyed Olympic newbie, one just happy to be there.\n\nThe one who emerged was a Team USA breakout star who suddenly faced a whole new track landscape -- one in which she was the hunted not the hunter, one where every race she entered came with more attention, more pressure, more expectation.\n\nAnd then came injury, a hamstring problem that kept her from competing in the 2022 world championships. All these issues were tests to her resolve.\n\nBut to really know the Gabby Thomas who somehow figured it all out is to understand that Gabby Thomas has made a career of figuring it all out. When her mother Jennifer Randall pushed her to stick with track back at Williston Northampton School -- \"She almost had to force me into it in high school, she knew I was fast.\" -- young Gabby had to find ways to make a sport she could barely tolerate more enjoyable.\n\n\"I set goals for myself, starting around my junior year, and I fell in love with achieving those goals and pushing myself and going after it,\" Thomas said. \"And track and field is a perfect sport for that, because it is a perfect equation of 'you get out what you put in.'\"\n\n\"I found the beauty in it,\" she said. \"I found the love in it. I just love chasing goals. I love chasing my dreams. I love moments like this, where everything kind of comes together.\"\n\nThomas is an expert at stitching her life together from many angles. At Harvard, where she committed after high school, that meant making academics a priority. But on her way to earning a degree in neurobiology, track pushed back in, and a stellar junior year allowed her to go pro.\n\nFrom there, it meant pushing those running goals to the top of the list, though not completely at the expense of continued studies. Leaving Boston for the University of Texas to pursue a master's degree didn't just put her among superior sprinting company, but at a renowned program in public health.\n\nAnd from there, she discovered the calling that will eventually take over full time, though not until she aims for at least one more Olympics in Los Angeles 2028 (not to mention two more potential relay medals here in Paris). Thomas volunteers as the director of a hypertension program at Austin's Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, working directly with a small group of 15-20 uninsured clients who are pre-diabetic and hypertensive, to help them manage and improve their health.\n\nFrom arranging for sponsors to donate free running shoes, to assisting in acquiring healthy food options, the experience has led her to shift from wanting to become a hospital CEO to working in public health instead.\n\nWho would bet against her?\n\nBy the halfway mark of Tuesday night's race, Thomas was already in control, even if she didn't realize it.\n\n\"I actually blacked out for the race,\" she said, \"but I knew what I wanted to do. My coach told me to go out and take the lead and finish strong.\n\n\"And it's kind of like tunnel vision at that point. I got out of the blocks and I couldn't tell you where anyone was. All I knew was I was focused on my own lane. It was the kind of energy where nothing matters but the finish line. I wasn't thinking about anything but getting to the finish line.\"\n\nAnd so she did, first by a wide margin. Hands that would later hold the edges of an American flag behind her back flew to the sides of head. And her mouth roared.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Americans will face Serbia on Thursday in a rematch of a U.S. pool-play victory.\n\nThe United States is 34-1 in the Olympics since 2004 and trying to win a fifth consecutive gold medal.\n\nJames took a stray elbow to the face halfway through the third quarter that put an early end to a clinical performance with 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting with nine assists, three rebounds and three steals. He left the court with three minutes remaining in the third quarter with a paper towel pressed above his left eye and returned with three minutes remaining in the game to chants of \"Le-Bron!\" When shown on the big screen, James waved his hand in recognition and mimicked putting a crown on his head.\n\nThe capacity crowd at Bercy Arena was electric in the earlier game Thursday evening that featured host nation France upsetting Canada, 82-73, for a spot in the semifinals, but was mostly sleepy during the U.S. blowout. The most energy early on seemed to come when Joel Embiid touched the ball, prompting loud boos each time.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers star with French citizenship shunned the Olympic host country by choosing to play for the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen in 2022 after being born in Cameroon. When Embiid hit his second 3-pointer of the first half, Davis and Bam Adebayo waved their hands toward the suddenly quiet crowd asking for more. Embiid finished with 14 points with seven rebounds. Devin Booker led the United States with 18 points.\n\n-- Los Angeles Times\n\nThomas takes 200 gold\n\nAmerican Gabby Thomas finally claimed the global title she has promised for so long when she delivered a dominant performance to take Olympic 200 meters gold on Tuesday, denying silver medalist Julien Alfred a sprint double.\n\nThomas, 27, took bronze in Tokyo and silver in last year's world championships, but gold had eluded one of the sport's most recognizable athletes and she had been vocal about her quest for an Olympic title.\n\nIn control of the final throughout the race, Thomas came home in 21.83 seconds and broke into a wide smile of disbelief, hands on her head, as she crossed the finish line.\n\n\"Honestly, I kind of blanked out for all of it. I can't even remember what I was doing, I just wanted to win,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"The only moment I remember was crossing the finish line and being in disbelief. That was it.\"\n\nAlfred, who claimed Saint Lucia's first Olympic medal when she won the 100m on Saturday, was fastest out of the blocks but was a clear second in 22.08, with Brittany Brown taking bronze for the U.S. in 20.20.\n\nThomas arrived in Paris with the world's fastest time this season of 21.78 and made an emphatic statement in Monday's semifinals when she pulled away from the field with ease over the final 50 meters to cross the line smiling in 21.86 seconds.\n\nThe race, which kicked off with a dazzling light show at Stade de France, was a blur for Thomas who has a Harvard degree in neurobiology and master's in public health from the University of Texas.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nU.S. women advance\n\nSophia Smith scored an overtime winner as the United States reached the Olympic women's soccer final with a 1-0 victory over Germany.\n\nThe U.S., eyeing its first title at the Games since 2012, will face Brazil, a 4-2 winner over Spain in the day's other semis, on Saturday.\n\nSmith scored five minutes into overtime to earn the U.S., playing a record seventh Olympic semifinal, a victory over a team it had already beaten 4-1 in the group stage.\n\nSmith chipped the ball over onrushing German keeper Ann-Katrin Berger after a through ball from Mallory Swanson.\n\n\"I just saw an open net in front of me and knew I had to step up in the big moment,\" Smith told NBC. \"I felt I had to do that for this team, we've been working so hard.\n\n\"We had a hard year last year.

And at her former prep school, Williston Northampton in Easthampton, dozens gathered to cheer her on.\n\nThe large room inside the campus center where the watch party was taking place grew quiet as the runners took their position in the starting blocks. And once the race was underway, the cheering grew and reached its peak when Thomas hit the finish line first.\n\nThen the celebration began, complete with hugs and high-fives.\n\nThomas earned the gold medal running a time of 21.83 seconds, beating silver medalist, St. Lucia's Julien Alfred and fellow-American Brittany Brown, who picked up the bronze.\n\nShe attended prep school at Williston before going to college at Harvard. The prep schools head, Robert W Hill, III said after the race, which Thomas won decisively, he became emotional watching his former student.\n\n\"I have to admit that I was brought to tears watching her at the end of that race and seeing how happy she was and just the sheer joy from all the training and all the work she's done,\" Hill said. \"To get gold, is just remarkable.\"\n\nAnd associate athletic director Melissa Brousseau, who was at Williston when Thomas was there, said she was proud of what the Olympian has accomplished.\n\n\"She is an amazing person, inside and out, and is superbly talented and works really hard for what she's accomplished,\" Brousseau said. \"It means the world to this community.\"\n\nBrousseau said while she was watching the race on Tuesday, her mind went back to a moment when Thomas was just starting out at Williston.\n\n\"I was actually thinking about her back in eighth grade when she was beating all of her fellow eighth graders sprinting at field day and she was crushing it then as an eighth grader, Brousseau said. \"Just to see her cross (the finish line), I almost cried. It's just so amazing.\"\n\nAnn Hallock, the school's communications director, said before the race, Thomas continues to be remembered fondly on the Easthampton campus.\n\n\"She set a new record just about every time she stepped on the track here, but was also a tremendous community member and scholar and everything else,\" Hallock said. \"It's very exciting to see somebody the community knows and loves very much achieving her dreams on the world stage.\"\n\nThe gold was the third Olympic medal for Thomas. She won a bronze medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics in the 200 meters and a silver in the 4x100 meter relay.\n\nIt's possible Thomas could still participate in a relay later this week.", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connecticut Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College-preparatory_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College-preparatory school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williston_Northampton_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Williston Northampton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_blocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting blocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easthampton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easthampton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Easthampton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/792c512/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x3213+0+909/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74%2Faa%2Fa250af874246a1c7437c94d441de%2Fimg-0020.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

Thomas' compatriot Brittany Brown claimed bronze, 0.12 seconds further back.\n\nIt completed a steady rise to the top for 27-year-old Thomas, who had clinched bronze in this event at the Tokyo 2020 Games and silver at the 2023 world championships.\n\nRogers, 25, announced a changing of the guard as she secured hammer throw gold with a best effort of 76.97 meters.\n\nThe U.S.'s Annette Echikunwoke grabbed silver with 75.48 and China's Zhao Jie took bronze with 74.27. Three-time defending champion Anita Wlodarczyk could only manage fourth, having dominated the event since the London 2012 Games.\n\nThe Pole was aiming to become only the third athlete in history - after Carl Lewis in long jump and Al Oerter in discus - to win the same individual athletics event at four consecutive Olympics.\n\nThere were three other gold medals decided in an enthralling night of athletics at the Stade de France on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S.'s Cole Hocker produced a barnstorming finish to clinch the men's 1,500m title, passing defending champion Jakob Ingebrigsten of Norway and

by winning the men's long jump with a best leap of 8.48 meters, 0.12 ahead of Jamaica's Wayne Pinnock, who took silver.\n\nItaly's Mattia Furlani took bronze with a jump of 8.34 meters.\n\nBahrain's Winfred Yavi broke the Olympic record to seize gold in the women's 3,000m steeplechase.\n\nThe 24-year-old completed the grueling event in 8 minutes, 52.76 seconds, eclipsing the previous Games record of 8:58.81 set by Russia's Gulnara Samitova-Galkina at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.\n\nUganda's Peruth Chemutai took silver in 8:53.34 and Kenya's Faith Cherotich claimed bronze in 8:55.15.", "source":

I wrote am email, I said 'I'm done running professionally, I'm going to go pursue other endeavours with my life'.\n\nThomas said she initially took up running grudgingly at the encouragement of her mother Jennifer Randall, who saw how fast she was on the soccer field.\n\nThomas ran for Harvard while completing a degree in neurobiology before earning a Master's in public health from the University of Texas.\n\nShe adopted a pug named Rico, saying the dog helped her through trying times when running was not going well.\n\n\"In every race that I ran, there were a lot of eyeballs on me,\" she said. \"There were a lot of expectations. And that was definitely a lot more pressure. And I had to adapt.\n\n\"That's what all of the best athletes do. That's what all of the greats do. You're forced to adapt when you're faced with a new challenge.\"\n\nThomas was still not entirely prepared for the ear-splitting screams of a jam-packed Stade de France.\n\n\"I envisioned this race over and over from start to finish,\" she said. \"I was not prepared for how I was going to feel when I crossed the line as an Olympic champion.\n\n\"There's no way to really prepare yourself for that. Tokyo Olympics was a lot of fun and it was great for me to experience that before coming here. But there is nothing like walking into a stadium of 80,000 people and they're screaming and they're right on top of you.\n\n\"That is a lot of pressure to put on someone and a lot of pressure for us to kind of deal with.\"\n\nIt was the first time since 1976 that there was no Jamaican on the podium in the Olympic women's 200 metres.\n\n(Reporting by Lori Ewing, additional reporting by Helen Reid, editing by Ed Osmond)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Alfred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julien Alfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2020_Summer_Paralympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2020 Summer Paralympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Brown_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brittany Brown (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_degrees_of_public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional degrees of public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Athletics_Championships_\u2013_Women's_200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's 200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795996", "eventUri": "eng-9795996", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 22, "textEnd": 27}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

It has been a quick turnaround,\" Neita told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Fourth was so bittersweet. I've had a little sleep on it and honestly I'm really proud of myself.

for the Netherlands on Saturday.\n\nAmerican defending champion and world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone claimed a comfortable victory in 53.60 in the final heat to move closer to an anticipated gold-medal showdown with Bol.\n\nGreat Britain's Elizabeth Bird qualified for the women's 3,000m steeplechase final by finishing fourth in her heat in nine minutes 16.46 seconds, but Aimee

He allegedly strapped himself underneath a food delivery lorry and was arrested a few days later. The former soldier denies all the charges against him and is due to stand trial in October.\n\nSecurity remained a \"serious concern\" at the prison, with \"chaotic\" wings and staff across most units unable to \"accurately account for their prisoners during the working day\", Mr Taylor warned as he described it as \"unfathomable\" that bosses had \"not focused their attention on this area\".\n\nThe Prison Governors' Association (PGA) said the move \"will be of no surprise to the Government\", in the wake of the prison's boss Katie Price resigning ahead of the inspection report published on Thursday.\n\nMr Taylor said: \"The poor outcomes we found at Wandsworth are systemic and cultural failures and stemmed from poor leadership at every level of the prison, from HMPPS (His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service) and the Ministry of Justice.\"\n\nMany \"well-meaning and hard-working leaders and staff persevered\" but they were often \"fighting against a tide of cross-cutting, intractable problems that require comprehensive, long-term solutions\".\n\nThe \"troubled prison\" needs \"permanent experienced leaders at all levels\" to begin to recover, he said, warning: \"Until this happens, the risk of a further catastrophe, a self-inflicted death or escape from lawful custody, is ever present.\"\n\nThe PGA said staff at the jail were in an \"almost impossible situation\", the governor at Wandsworth \"decided to leave\" earlier this year and \"resigned during the inspection\", adding that this was \"undoubtedly due in part to the personal toll that running a prison like Wandsworth in current times takes\".\n\n'Poor or non-existent'\n\nThe prison was \"not reducing the risk of men reoffending\", the watchdog's inspection carried out between April 22 and May 2 found. Relationships between staff and prisoners were \"poor or non-existent\".\n\nMost staff at every level were \"very inexperienced\", and, despite being fully staffed \"on paper\", more than a third of staff were not available for work each day, leading to additional restrictions on prisoners and \"burnt-out prison officers struggling to keep things going\".\n\nEdward Argar, a prisons minister, said the \"deeply concerning report\" shows the jail continues to face \"significant challenges\" and it was \"clear that on top of the additional support we've already provided since September to improve safety and security, including nearly \u00a31 million of upgrades, we need to go further still.\"\n\nExtra experienced staff will be added to the prison's management team in the coming weeks to provide the \"leadership, culture change and training needed to turn Wandsworth around\", he said, adding: \"In the interim we are deploying more staff, including prison officers, to the prison and will set out further action shortly.\"\n\nWandsworth is the sixth prison to be issued with an urgent notification since November 2022, joining Exeter, Woodhill, Bristol and Bedford jails as well as Cookham Wood young offender institution.\n\nThe notice effectively places the jail in special measures and means the Justice Secretary has to urgently produce an action plan for improvement before the watchdog carries out another inspection.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_hymas@yahoo.com", "name": "Charles Hymas", "type":

It has not had the maintenance money it should.\n\n\"It is very difficult to run a good prison when it is overcrowded, the buildings are not invested in and you are finding it difficult to retain and recruit staff, which is the case with Wandsworth.\"\n\nIt is understood that Mr Taylor will this week issue an urgent notification on HMP Wandsworth, which means he has \"urgent and significant concern\" about the performance of the facility.\n\nIt means Alex Chalk, the Justice Secretary, has 28 days to publish an action plan to improve the jail before a follow-up visit by the chief inspector to check progress.\n\nLast October, local watchdogs branded the prison \"unsafe and inhumane\".\n\n'Violence continues to rise'\n\nWandsworth's independent monitoring board (IMB) found that years of underinvestment in the site, facilities and staff at the prison had led to an unsafe environment where \"violence levels continue to rise\".\n\nThe report stated that during the past year, staff shortages had undermined the prison's ability to function effectively, with the number of available officers rarely reaching above 50 per cent.\n\nIt reported that assaults had risen by more than 20 per cent in all areas, including assaults on staff.\n\nOf the 524 assaults on prisoners by prisoners, 301 were referred to the police.\n\nThe IMB warned that conditions at the category B prison \"remained inhumane\", with the Victorian buildings continuing to deteriorate.\n\n11 showers for 265 men\n\nOvercrowding was also raised as a concern by the monitoring board, with most men sharing cells designed for single occupancy.\n\nIn two wings of the prison, there were only 11 shower stalls for 265 men, the board noted.\n\nIt came as it emerged that some prisoners will be freed up to 70 days early after ministers quietly extended an emergency early release scheme to alleviate the prison overcrowding crisis.\n\nIt will take effect from May 23 amid fears that prisons could run out of space this summer without action to reduce overcrowding.\n\nIt is the second extension since the early release scheme was introduced in October.\n\nIn March, it was increased from 18 days to a maximum of 60 days.\n\nThe Prison Governors' Association said: \"We confirm the governor of Wandsworth has resigned from [the prison service], a decision made some time before the announced HMP Inspection.\n\n\"As a sign of loyalty to her team and Wandsworth she agreed to remain in the post until the inspection concluded.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Experiences from the overpopulated prison reveal accounts of vermin, mould, sewage-riddled cells, understaffing, limited clothing, and a lack of medical attention for inmates.\n\nThe Prison Governors Association has confirmed on X that Katie Price, the governor of HMP Wandsworth (not to be confused with the reality star) has resigned from the prison service. In a statement, they said that Ms Price had resigned before the inspection had taken place.\n\nThe statement says: \"We confirm the Governor of Wandsworth has resigned from HMPPS a decision they made some time before the announced HMIP Inspection. As a sign of loyalty to her team & Wandsworth she agreed to remain in post until the inspection concluded. We will be making no further comments on X\".\n\nREAD MORE: Man stabbed to death in murder named and pictured for first time\n\nReports of inhumane conditions at the South London prison led to the development of the Wandsworth Prison Improvement Campaign ( WPIC ), which held its first meeting on April 10. Governor Price declined the invitation to attend the event, the campaign group has said.\n\nFormer prison chaplain Liz Bridge said: \"Our prisons have gone beyond liveable and have slipped into disgusting. It's unfair on human beings that it's not run correctly, that it's not working right.\"\n\nBridge and her charity The Welfare Trust, which donated books and games to prisoners, were irrevocably excluded on the grounds of security risks. This was due to Bridge giving small sums of money to inmates who were to be released with nothing.\n\nWhen former inmate David Shipley received his OASys report, a document detailing an inmate's offences, it was both miscategorised and inaccurate. This took several months to correct, with the assistance of high-profile civil rights lawyer, Lorna Hackett.\n\nShipley said: \"It is genuinely the worst managed, worst run organisation I have ever encountered in my life.\"\n\nHMP Wandsworth is also where inmate Daniel Khalife escaped from for three days in September 2023. Khalife is believed to have escaped by strapping himself to the bottom of a food delivery lorry while working in the prison's kitchen.\n\nIn response to accusations of incompetence, a prison service spokesperson said: \"We're taking decisive action to improve safety and conditions at HMP Wandsworth. This includes boosting staffing levels and investing millions into upgrades such as rolling out new CCTV, installing new windows and repairing roofs, as well as refurbishing healthcare facilities.\"\n\nHM Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor made a surprise visit to Wandsworth last week after previously saying to Sky News that the institution 'really needs closing.' Chief Taylor is yet to release the outcome of the recent inspection, but the WPIC has posted on X, claiming that the prison is about to be issued an 'Urgent Notification' due to significant concerns about the prison's conditions.\n\nDetails of the Governor's resignation are yet to be confirmed, and Wandsworth Prison inspection are to be concluded later this week.\n\nGot a story for us?

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nWandsworth prison must be put into emergency measures amid concerns over security failings and severe problems with overcrowding, drugs, violence and self-harm, a watchdog has said.\n\nHM chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor has issued an urgent notification to the justice secretary, sounding the alarm on the \"cramped, squalid conditions\" inside the prison.\n\nHMP Wandsworth was criticised last year after an inmate Daniel Khalife allegedly escaped prison by strapping himself to the underside of a food delivery vehicle with bedsheets.\n\nMr Taylor said that \"security remained a serious concern\", adding: \"Wings were chaotic and staff across most units could not accurately account for their prisoners during the working day.\"\n\nHe slammed the poor leadership \"at every level of the prison, from HMPPS and the Ministry of Justice\" for contributing to the mounting failings. Mr Taylor said that unless experienced leaders are installed at the prison \"the risk of a further catastrophe, a self-inflicted death or escape from lawful custody, is ever present\".\n\nThe inspector said that most staff at every level of the prison were \"very inexperienced, and, despite being fully staffed on paper, over a third of operational staff weren't available for work each day\".\n\n80 per cent of prisoners shared cells designed for one person and most men spent more than 22 hours a day confined \"to these cramped, squalid conditions with no idea if or when they would leave them or have any access to fresh air\", Mr Taylor noted.\n\nAs a result prisoners had sunk to a \"degree of despondency that I have not come across in my time as chief inspector\", he added.\n\nIncidents of self-harm inside the prison are also high, but despite this around 40 per cent of emergency cell bells were not answered within the required five minutes.\n\nPia Sinha, chief executive of the Prison Reform Trust, said the chief inspector's report \"reveals a failure of leadership from top to bottom\". She added that ministers were \"rapidly running out of effective options\" to deal with emergencies in prisons, due to shrinking capacity in the prison estate.\n\nShe added: \"Previously, the first thing a prisons minister would consider was to rapidly decant a large number of people from the prison to give staff much needed breathing space to address concerns.\n\n\"But with prisons in the midst of a capacity crisis, there is simply no give in the system to do this.\"\n\nIn response to the findings, prisons minister Edward Argar said: \"This is a deeply concerning report which shows HMP Wandsworth continues to face significant challenges and it is clear that on top of the additional support we've already provided since September to improve safety and security, including nearly \u00a31m of upgrades, we need to go further still.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Wandsworth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HM Prison Wandsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Argar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Argar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Reform_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison Reform Trust"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/09/16/PA-73731940.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553932", "eventUri": "eng-9553932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.592156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He allegedly strapped himself underneath a food delivery lorry and was arrested a few days later. The former soldier denies all the charges against him and will face trial in October.\n\nKatie Price, the governor of the prison, resigned following Taylor's inspection this week. Experiences from the overpopulated prison reveal accounts of vermin, mould, sewage-riddled cells, understaffing, limited clothing, and a lack of medical attention for inmates.\n\nTaylor warned security remained a serious concern at the prison, with \"chaotic\" wings and staff across most units unable to \"accurately account for their prisoners during the working day\". He said it was \"unfathomable\" that bosses had \"not focused their attention on this area\".\n\nThe Prison Governors' Association said the move \"will be of no surprise to the government\" after Price's resignation.\n\nTaylor said: \"The poor outcomes we found at Wandsworth are systemic and cultural failures and stemmed from poor leadership at every level of the prison, from HMPPS (His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service) and the Ministry of Justice.\"\n\nSeven prisoners had taken their own lives in the past year, Taylor said.\n\nFour out of five of the 1,513 men held there were sharing cells designed for one person and most inmates spent more than 22 hours confined to the \"cramped, squalid\" conditions with \"no idea if or when they would leave them or have any access to fresh air\", according to the findings.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rajeev_syal@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Rajeev Syal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_overcrowding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prison overcrowding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrial action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Carmichael", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alistair Carmichael"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Wandsworth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HM Prison Wandsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Justice_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Justice (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Chalk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Chalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_and_Probation_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HM Prison and Probation Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Price", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandsworth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wandsworth"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/5e727a64bc282e8704f2549e6ffd497f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553932", "eventUri": "eng-9553932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

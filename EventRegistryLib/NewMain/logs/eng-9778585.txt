The Indian star delivered a remarkable shot that could be immortalized in badminton folklore. Locked in a fierce rally against Christie's relentless defense, Sen found himself in an awkward stance as the shuttlecock flew back and forth, both players engaged in an intense battle of endurance.\n\nIt was then when the marvelous moment was produced by Lakshya. As the shuttle hurtled towards him, Sen displayed his tremendous wrist work and executed a behind-the-back shot that left Christie stunned. The shot was executed with such precision that it left Christie off guard.\n\nTrailing 0-4 in the first game, Sen made a brilliant comeback to win the set 21-18. In the second, the All England champion couldn't match Sen's pace, as the Indian took a six-point lead at one point and ultimately won the game 21-12.\n\nMeanwhile, the Round of 16 could feature an all-Indian showdown, as Sen is likely to face HS Prannoy next, provided Prannoy wins his upcoming match against Vietnam's Le Duc Phat. Prannoy, having already won his first match, needs just one more victory to secure his spot in the last 16.

The Indian ace produced some remarkable moments in the match but one moment, in particular, caught the eye of the fans.\n\nBoth players fought tooth and nail in the first game and exchanged some remarkable shots. Lakshya had a slender lead of a single point towards the business end of the opening game. Despite the scoreline reading 19-18 in favour of Sen, it could have been anybody's game. But Sen had other ideas. The talented athlete produced a moment of magic by smashing a quick backhand return to stun the Indonesian, who lost the point after hitting the shuttle wide.\n\nIn the pre-quarter-finals, Sen will most likely face his Indian compatriot HS Prannoy, who will face Vietnam's Le Duc Phat later in the day. Sen had brushed aside Kevin Cordon in the opening Group L match on Sunday which was \"deleted\" after his Guatemalan opponent pulled out due to a left elbow injury.

I think the last few months the form has been really good.\n\n\"There has been ups and downs, but overall, I was in good shape in the last few months, and especially while playing here in the French Open, I found my momentum and from.\n\n\"I was just trying to build up for a good event and I'm really pumped up to fight every match and every point.\" While Sen is expected to face world number 13 HS Prannoy in an all-Indian contest, Sindhu is likely to be up against world number 9 Chinese He Bingjiao, against whom she has lost 11 times and won on nine occasions.\n\nIt must be mentioned that Sindhu had beaten the Chinese on way to her bronze medal in Tokyo Games.\n\nPrannoy will face Vietnam's Le Duc Phat later in the day.\n\nThe only time Sen had defeated Christie was four years ago at the Badminton Asia Team Championships and came into this match with a dismal 1-4 head-to-head count.\n\nHowever, the 22-year-old from Almora, a 2021 world championships bronze medallist, showed great maturity and tactical acumen as he went about his business on Wednesday.\n\nHe tried to keep the shuttle flat and target the weak forehand of Christie, who looked to slow down the rallies and used his cross-court shots at the corners to trouble the Indian, albeit without much success.\n\nIn the first game, Christie opened up a 5-0 lead and soon moved to 8-2. However, Sen regrouped quickly, kept the shuttle flat and waited for his opponent to make mistakes.\n\nIt worked as he moved to 7-8 before a thunderous forehand smash earned the Indian a slim one-point advantage.\n\nSen engaged Christie in fast and flat exchanges to move to 14-12, and the latter slowed down the pace with a gruelling rally, which he won with a push at the backline.\n\nThe Indonesian drew parity at 16-16 with a precise cross-court smash, which a diving Sen couldn't reach and soon eked out a two-point lead at 18-16. A straight smash from Sen was followed by a wide smash from Christie, and it was 18-18.\n\nA perfect flat push and then an incredible behind-the-back return in the middle of the next rally gave Sen game point and he converted it easily to earn the bragging rights.\n\nAfter the change of sides, Sen made some judgment errors at the backline as the two were tied 3-3. But the Indian kept peppering the back court with his pushes and smashes and played at a high tempo. His reflex defence was also rock solid as he moved to 10-5.\n\nAnother error from Christie, and it was a five-point advantage for Sen at the halfway mark. The Indian kept his opponent at bay with a barrage of strokes and didn't allow him to come to the net.\n\nThe Indonesian made too many errors in desperation, missing the lines often as Sen moved to 18-12. Another flat exchange ended at the net as Sen inched closer to the line.\n\nAnother long rally ended with a long shot for the Indonesian as Sen grabbed eight match points and when the Indonesian sent another to the net, the Indian rejoiced.\n\nDominant show by Sindhu ================= Earlier, Sindhu, who is seeking to become the first Indian to win three Olympic medals, topped the group following her facile win over Kuuba, ranked 73rd in the world, in 33 minutes.\n\n\"It was important for me to top the group. I would be playing against He Bingjiao mostly. I hope I take this confidence and go forward. It's not going to be easy, especially in the next coming rounds, so I have to be prepared and be 100%,\" said Sindhu, who won a silver medal in the 2016 Rio Games and a bronze in the Tokyo edition.\n\nThe winner of each of the 16 groups qualifies for the round of 16.\n\nThe gulf in class between the two players was evident as Sindhu pocketed the opening game in 14 minutes with the Estonian looking completely out of sorts.\n\nThe 27-year-old Kuuba gave a fight in the second game, making a lot of retrievals, but Sindhu was just too good for her ultimately.\n\nKuuba took a 2-0 lead but Sindhu quickly seized the initiative and levelled the score. Kuuba did not throw in the towel and engaged the Indian in longer rallies.\n\nThere was one rare moment when Sindhu was stretched to the full near the net and Kuuba smashed the shuttle beyond the reach of the Indian.\n\nBut the vastly experienced Sindhu was in her elements soon after.\n\nTwo cross-court smashes gave Sindhu a 15-6 lead and from there on, it was all over for the Estonian, who saved two match points before surrendering.

Prannoy will face Vietnam's Le Duc Phat later in the day.\n\nSen had defeated Kevin Cordon, a Tokyo Olympics semifinalist, in the opening Group L match on Sunday which was \"deleted\" after his Guatemalan opponent pulled out due to a left elbow injury.\n\nA gold medallist at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, Sen beat Julien Carraggi of Belgium before facing Christie.\n\nThe only time the Indian had defeated Christie was four years ago at the Badminton Asia Team Championships and came into this match with a dismal 1-4 head-to-head count.\n\nHowever, Sen rose to the occasion on Wednesday and showed great maturity as he went about his business.\n\nHe tried to keep the shuttle flat and target the weak forehand of Christie, who looked to slow down the rallies and used his cross court shots at the corners to trouble the Indian, albeit without much success.\n\nIn the first game, Christie opened up a 5-0 lead and soon moved to 8-2. However, Sen regrouped quickly, kept the shuttle flat and waited for his opponent to make mistakes.\n\nIt worked as he moved to 7-8 before a thunderous forehand smash earned the Indian a slim one-point advantage.\n\nSen engaged Christie in fast and flat exchanges to move to 14-12, and the latter slowed down the pace with a gruelling rally, which he won with a push at the backline.\n\nThe Indonesian drew parity at 16-16 with a precise cross-court smash, which a diving Sen couldn't reach and soon eked out a two-point lead at 18-16. A straight smash from Sen was followed by a wide smash from Christie, and it was 18-18.\n\nA perfect flat push and then an incredible behind-the-back return in the middle of the next rally gave Sen game point and he converted it easily to earn the bragging rights.\n\nAfter the change of sides, Sen made some judgment errors at the backline as the two were tied 3-3. But the Indian kept peppering the back court with his pushes and smashes and played at a high tempo. His reflex defence was also rock solid as he moved to 10-5.\n\nAnother error from Christie, and it was a five-point advantage for Sen at the halfway mark. The Indian kept his opponent at bay with a barrage of strokes and didn't allow him to come to the net.\n\nThe Indonesian made too many errors in desperation, missing the lines often as Sen moved to 18-12. Another flat exchange ended at the net as Sen inched closer to the line.\n\nAnother long rally ended with a long shot for the Indonesian as Sen grabbed eight match points and when the Indonesian sent another to the net, the Indian rejoiced.

In the underlying case, Arpaio's office was found to have discriminated against Latinos during the lawman's illegal-immigration patrols.\n\nSome have speculated that Trump will use the rally as occasion to repay Arpaio, who was one of Trump's earliest supporters.

But she believes elected officials should publicly support the \"cry that this president is not welcome to continue to drive a message of hate.\"\n\n\"The community has banded together for years to fight against Joe Arpaio's abuses toward individuals, and also, quite frankly, to our legal system,\" she said. \"If the president ignores the federal judicial system when they have found Joe Arpaio guilty, he is slapping the community in the face.\"\n\nWarren Stewart Jr., pastor at Church of the Remnant in south Phoenix, said he will lend the group his support \"because it's an issue of justice.\"\n\n\"Trump has not done anything for racial relations at all except incite more hate and give a pass to racism,\" he said.\n\nTrump is expected to speak at the Phoenix Convention Center -- where he held multiple high-profile campaign events last year -- at 7 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nRepublic reporter Megan Cassidy contributed to this article.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nPresident Trump's ardent backers support him more than ever\n\nWhy did Trump choose Arizona for an outside-the-swamp rally?\n\nBrewer defends Trump's Charlottesville remarks\n\nTrump's denouncement disappoints, angers white nationalists\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Arpaio Fullscreen Donald Trump and Joe Arpaio Scott Olson/Getty ImagesFullscreen Sheriff Joe Arpaio at a Trump rally in Phoenix.

Yes, the man who boasted that he was applying the rule of law for the 24 years he was Maricopa County sheriff gets to laugh at us.\n\nIt's a big deal because Arpaio wounded Latinos profoundly with his racial profiling.\n\nSetting him free is a slap in the face to the tireless work of so many people to hold him accountable. It's a slap in the face to the taxpayers of Maricopa County who have already shelled out about $70 million since 2008 to deal with racial profiling legal challenges. And taxpayers are estimated to pay another $26 million next year.\n\nDIAZ: We can't let Arpaio off the hook now\n\nMONTINI: Trump should pardon Arpaio\n\nBut most importantly, setting Arpaio free is a slap in the face to the \"rule of law,\" the same concept his supporters still beamed over any criticism of the former sheriff.\n\nLet's be consistent here. Since Arpaio and his supporters love the rule of law, he should man up and face justice.\n\nBut the self-described toughest sheriff in America won't man up. He'll gladly accept a presidential pardon because he must be terrified to spend a night in jail as an inmate.\n\nFight against their ideas - peacefully\n\nI'm done with Arpaio the person. He'll most certainly get his pardon, and there is nothing we can do about it.\n\nBut I'm not done with Arpaio the idea. He and Trump represent the worst of America, and we must stand up to that.\n\nLatino leaders across the state, from U.S. Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva to state Sens. Catherine Miranda and Mart\u00edn Quezada, are leading an anti-Trump protest in Phoenix.\n\n\"Now more than ever we all must come together as a unified community to send a strong message that we are appalled that President Trump is considering a pardon of sheriff Arpaio's blatant disregard of a federal judge's order to obey the Constitution of the United States,'' said Miranda in a statement.\n\nMORE: Democrats ask Trump not to pardon Arpaio\n\nQuezada added:\n\n\"We must all join hands in unity to oppose the racist President Trump as he decides to render a presidential pardon of the conviction of former sheriff Joe Arpaio.\"\n\nEveryone who cares about justice should come Tuesday afternoon to downtown Phoenix when Trump is scheduled to speak. But any protest or march must be carried out peacefully. We have an opportunity to show the strength of our numbers but also the strength of our character.\n\nWe must fight our emotions and resist the temptation to strike back with violence. We must show we're better than Trump. We must show we're better than Arpaio.\n\nElvia D\u00edaz is an editorial columnist for The Republic and azcentral.

In the underlying case, Arpaio's office was found to have discriminated against Latinos during the lawman's illegal-immigration patrols.\n\nSome have speculated that Trump will use the rally as occasion to repay Arpaio, who was one of Trump's earliest supporters. Arpaio on Thursday told The Arizona Republic nothing has been confirmed to him.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton urged Trump to delay his visit, and a chorus of Democrats have called on the president not to pardon Arpaio.\n\nWilliams' statement refrained from political commentary, focusing solely on the law-enforcement side of the operation.\n\nRead the entire statement below:\n\nMessage from Police Chief Jeri Williams on Visit from President Trump\n\nBy now, you probably have heard that President Trump is coming to Phoenix for a rally on Tuesday, August 22nd. While Phoenix is not immune from critical incidents, I want you to know that your city is working hard to ensure another safe event. Because high profile events are common in Phoenix, we are well prepared to handle another Presidential visit. Our experience with other dignitary visits, Super Bowls, music festivals, major professional and collegiate sporting events, allows us to quickly deploy resources that keep our residents and visitors safe. At all times, the Phoenix Police Department has officers assigned to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center to constantly monitor and evaluate activities that may impact our local communities. These long term partnerships with other local, state, and federal agencies, help ensure that information is shared and acted upon in a seamless manner. In addition to partnerships with other law enforcement agencies and City Departments, we have active relationships with local community organizers in order to obtain the most current and accurate information regarding any related events directly from the source. While I won't discuss specifics regarding our security planning, I want everyone to know that our preparations are well underway. We will have maximum staffing during the visit and are working 24/7 with our partners to ensure all of our resources are in place. We do expect a lot of activity in the downtown area but we are prepared to minimize the impact to area businesses and residents. As always, I expect our officers will remain professional, decisive, and immediately responsive should the need arise. For those who plan to be in the downtown area, we encourage you to plan ahead. Expect delays for traffic and security checkpoints. Be mindful of the weather as heat and thunderstorms may be in the forecast. Be aware of your surroundings and, as always, if you see something, say something.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nLegislators fight Trump visit, Arpaio pardon\n\nPresident Trump's ardent backers support him more than ever\n\nWhy did Trump choose Arizona for an outside-the-swamp rally?\n\nBrewer defends Trump's Charlottesville remarks\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Arpaio Fullscreen Donald Trump and Joe Arpaio Scott Olson/Getty ImagesFullscreen Sheriff Joe Arpaio at a Trump rally in Phoenix.

But he says he has not heard directly from Trump since the president said he was seriously considering pardoning Arpaio on a recent conviction for criminal contempt of court.\n\nIn an interview with NPR Thursday, Arpaio said he would be honored if Trump follows through. And he welcomed the idea of Trump holding a planned campaign rally in Phoenix Tuesday, despite concerns by the mayor and others that it would inflame emotions after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nHe said he hadn't yet been invited to the rally, but held out the possibility that he'd been in contact with others at the White House.\n\nTrump told Fox News earlier this week that he was \"seriously considering\" a pardon for Arpaio. He called the sheriff \"a great American patriot\" and said he'd done \"a lot in the fight against illegal immigration.\"\n\nThe administration announced the president would hold a campaign style rally in Phoenix next Tuesday, and the president posted a link for tickets.\n\n\"It makes me feel good that at least someone is backing me up. And how much better can you get than president of the United States?\" Arpaio said.\n\nPhoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, released a statement Wednesday urging Trump to reconsider holding Tuesday's rally. He said if Trump was coming to Phoenix to pardon Arpaio, \"then it will be clear that his true intent is to enflame emotions and further divide our nation.\"\n\nArpaio, now 85 years old, believes he and the president have both been unfairly smeared as racists. He predicts Trump will end up being regarded as the greatest president in American history, \"We need him and I feel sad how they're trying to destroy him. It makes me sick. I'll tell you one thing he's got guts and courage and that's what this country needs.\"\n\nThe self-styled \"America's Toughest Sheriff\" has been having a tough time of it lately. After becoming America's former toughest sheriff after losing his latest re-election campaign in November, he was convicted last month of criminal contempt by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton for \"willfully violating an order of the court\" to end his deputies' crackdown on immigrants.\n\nThe sheriff believed he had the legal right to instruct his deputies to detain Hispanic drivers and pedestrians and inquire about their legal status. The federal courts had previously disagreed, and the judge found that Arpaio knew he was violating their order when his deputies continued doing it.\n\nArpaio will be sentenced in October. He faces a possible six-month prison sentence.\n\nArpaio made a national reputation for himself out of the way he treated prisoners, housing them in tents in triple digit temperatures, forcing them to eat recovered food, and to wpink underwear. Chain gangs were his specialties. But it was the creation of an immigration posse that created legal consequences for the sheriff -- thousands of citizens who were enlisted to help Maricopa County deputies enforce immigration law. The federal courts slapped the sheriff down and stripped him of his immigration enforcement authority. Arpaio's posse eventually disbanded.\n\n\"As far as the situation on a pardon, I didn't ask for it but I will accept it if he does do it,\" Arpaio said. \"This president understands what I've been going through. There aren't many politicians around believe me. I learned that real quick over this situation. You don't see anybody next to me and I've endorsed so many people.\"\n\nArpaio hinted that if he's pardoned he'll consider running for office again. \"I've got a lot of options out there.

The commander-in-chief this week said he was \"seriously considering\" a pardon for his political ally, and commentators are speculating that could come as early as Trump's Tuesday rally in Phoenix.\n\nStill, Arpaio's attorneys are marching forward in defense mode. On Monday, they filed dual motions in federal court, asking U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton to toss her conviction or grant a new jury trial. On Wednesday, they sent a supplemental brief to SCOTUS, reminding the court of a petition they filed in May.\n\nThe Supreme Court brief also deals with the issue of a jury trial. Bolton had ruled against it before the trial began, as defendants are typically only guaranteed a trial by their peers if they face more than 6 months in jail. The maximum sentence Arpaio could receive is six months.\n\nArpaio's attorneys argue that there are exceptions though, specifically for contempt-of-court cases.\n\nMORE: Taxpayer tab up to $70M in Joe Arpaio racial-profiling case\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Arpaio Fullscreen Donald Trump and Joe Arpaio Scott Olson, Getty ImagesFullscreen Sheriff Joe Arpaio at a Trump rally in Phoenix.

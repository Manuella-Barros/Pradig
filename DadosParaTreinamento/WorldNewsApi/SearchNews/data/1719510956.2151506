The French actress, 38, known for playing Dr Madeleine Swann in the James Bond films starring Daniel Craig, said she sees the US film industry as more of a \u201cbusiness\u201d where \u201ceverything has to be heightened\u201d, unlike in Europe. \u201cMaybe because it\u2019s a young country?\u201d she said in the Sunday Times culture magazine. \u201cSo people want to stay young forever? It\u2019s a society that is infantilising and you cannot get older in America. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a disease there, getting older. It\u2019s the same for men. \u201cIt\u2019s part of their culture. In America you are always infantilised. From the adverts you see in the streets to the writing they put on their cereal packets. \u201cI feel lucky to be a European actress.\u201d She has previously been outspoken against sexual harassment in Hollywood. \u201cThere was cinema before the #MeToo movement, and after,\u201d Seydoux said. \u201cAnd it is crazy? I have experienced both. Certain things were accepted that now seem surreal.\u201d Seydoux was in 2015\u2019s Spectre and 2021\u2019s No Time To Die as the capable Dr Madeleine and did not play a traditional Bond girl. She said: \u201cIt would\u2019ve been weird to do Bond nowadays with a guy who is super-misogynistic. \u201cIt has to reflect the society we\u2019re living in.\u201d She also gave her reaction to French President Emmanuel Macron saying Gerard Depardieu \u201cmakes France proud\u201d, amid sexual misconduct allegations against the veteran actor. Seydoux said it gives a \u201cvery bad image of our country\u201d but she added the \u201cyoung generation is very active\u201d in calling out these issues. Seydoux is also known for French romantic film Blue Is The Warmest Colour, comedy The Grand Budapest Hotel, time travel movie Midnight In Paris and she was recently in science fiction epic Dune: Part Two.", "summary": "The French actress played Dr Madeleine Swann in two James Bond films.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/america-french-james-bond-daniel-craig-emmanuel-macron-b1160319.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/26/15/07d48260f5d601153f72fefa05e8c89dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE2ODE1Mjg5-2.75351328.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:58:35", "author": "Charlotte McLaughlin", "authors": ["Charlotte McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.193}

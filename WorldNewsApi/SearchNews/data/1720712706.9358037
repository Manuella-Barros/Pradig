Argamani, a Chinese-born Israeli citizen, said she thought she was going to be killed when Hamas stormed the Nova Music Festival on Oct. 7, per Channel 13, where the terror group slaughtered more than 360 people. Later, when she arrived in Gaza, she was certain that she would be publicly lynched by the crowd that awaited her, she told family members, according to Israel\u2019s Channel 13. While Argamani survived the initial assault \u2014 with her screams of terror uploaded on social media as she was put on the back of a motorcycle and hauled off to Gaza \u2014 the 26-year-old said she was certain that she would be publicly lynched by the crowd that awaited her, she told family members, according to Israel\u2019s Channel 13. Later, she said she nearly died, again, after Israeli missiles struck the compound she was being held in, she told family members. \u201cI saw the missile enter the house; I was sure I was going to die,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cI thought that was it, but I stayed alive,\u201d Argamani added. Argamani appeared to be referencing the Israeli strike that allegedly killed fellow hostages Yossi Sharabi and Itai Svirsky, which she was forced to announce in a cruel propaganda video released by the terror group in January that displayed their corpses. The she also recounted how she believed she was going to die in the chaos of the operation that led to her rescue on Saturday. Along with the near-death experiences Argamani recalled how she was forced to move between several apartments during her captivity, which also spared her the fate of being kept inside Hamas\u2019 dark and winding tunnel network like other hostages. On the rare opportunities she was allowed to go outside, she said she was forced to dress like a Palestinian woman. Argamani was one of four Nova festival hostages rescued on Saturday after Israeli forces stormed two Hamas-run buildings in central Gaza\u2019s Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Israeli military. The other hostages rescued during the Israeli raid, which involved the Israeli Defense Force, Shin Bet and counterterrorism police officers, were Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40. Saturday\u2019s raid was the largest single recovery of hostages captured by Hamas, bringing the total number rescued up to seven. However, the raid has been the subject of major international criticism after the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said the raid on the Nuseirat refugee camp killed 274 Palestinians, including dozens of children. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed at least some civilians were killed in the raid. \u201cWe do know this \u2026 Innocent people were tragically killed in this operation,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. \u201cAnd that is heartbreaking. That is tragic.\u201d After returning to Israel, Argamani was seen embracing her father, Yakov, and sharing a pair of Coca Colas in a hospital room at the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. She also reunited with her mother, Liora, who is battling stage four brain cancer and had publicly stated she was praying to see her daughter again before she dies.", "summary": "Argamani, whose terrified face on Oct. 7 became an enduring image of the the terror attack, was freed in an Israeli raid.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/world-news/hostage-noa-argamani-recalls-harrowing-captivity-under-hamas/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/83529822.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:39:10", "author": "Ronny Reyes", "authors": ["Ronny Reyes"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.213}

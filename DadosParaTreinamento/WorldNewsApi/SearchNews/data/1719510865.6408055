{"id": 223698608, "title": "Sergio Perez involved in 'monster' accident on first lap of the Monaco Grand Prix with racing halted...", "text": "Sergio Perez walked away unscathed from a huge crash on a crazy opening lap of the Monaco Grand Prix. The Mexican, starting 16th, was tagged by the Haas of Kevin Magnussen heading uphill after the first corner, Sainte Devote. The Dane\u2019s front left caught Perez\u2019s rear right, sending the latter into the barriers. Perez then richoted into the other Haas of Nico Hulkenberg in dramatic pinball action that brought out a red flag while the debris was cleared. Perez\u2019s Red Bull was all but destroyed with just one wheel left attached, though the monocoque protected the driver from physical damage. All climbed out without obvious injuries. In a mad start, the two Alpines tangled, sending Esteban Ocon airborne on the entry to the tunnel. He landed safely and continued until the race was suspended. Carlos Sainz, running third for Ferrari, stopped at Casino Square after appearing to go in too deep. Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc led from pole with McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri second prior to the stoppage.", "summary": "The Mexican, starting 16th, was tagged by the Haas of Kevin Magnussen heading uphill after the first corner, The Dane's front left caught Perez's rear right, sending the latter into the barriers.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-13461431/Sergio-Perez-involved-monster-accident-lap-Monaco-Grand-Prix-racing-halted-crash-Kevin-Magnussen.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/14/85351717-0-image-a-55_1716729363620.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:25:51", "author": "Editor,Jonathan Mcevoy", "authors": ["Editor", "Jonathan Mcevoy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.401}

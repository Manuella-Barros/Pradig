{"id": 231206966, "title": "Why the Trump hush money trial verdict is peak 'lawfare'", "text": "The Democrats finally got their ounce of Donald Trump\u2019s flesh in a Manhattan courtroom last week but like Shakespeare\u2019s Antonio in \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d the bloodlust may be their own undoing. The guilty verdict should be reversed by the New York appellate or federal courts and likely will be at some point \u2014 but perhaps only after the clear election interference objective of the Democrats has been met. Never before have state prosecutors charged a defendant with federal election reporting violations (state courts don\u2019t have jurisdiction) and never have non-disclosure agreements been found by a jury in any criminal trial to be a reportable federal campaign expenditure. In a game of legal hide the ball, Trump was denied the time-honored constitutional right to notice of the charges against him and to a unanimous jury verdict on those charges. Instead, the jury was allowed to cherry-pick non-unanimously from a menu of \u201cadditional charges\u201d \u2014 unproven federal campaign, tax and other bookkeeping charges \u2014 that Alvin Bragg needed in order to manufacture a felony out of an expired misdemeanor bookkeeping violation. When independent counsel Ken Starr pursued President Clinton criminally for covering up an affair, Democrats cried foul, arguing that prosecutors were using the law highly selectively to go after a political opponent \u2014 the classic definition of lawfare. How things have situationally changed in a few short years. What has changed most is the industry of lawfare. Democrats were dumbfounded by Trump\u2019s 2016 nomination and subsequent election. President Obama\u2019s Department of Justice commenced controversial counterintelligence investigations of Trump campaign officials and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign paid for a bogus \u201cSteele Dossier\u201d claiming Trump to be a Russian mole. Tellingly, Bragg never even considered prosecuting Clinton for misreporting this ill-begotten hit job as a \u201clegal expense\u201d even though the parallels to the Trump case are eerily similar. In Clinton\u2019s case, the FEC appropriately fined the Clinton campaign a modest sum \u2014 which is what, at most, should have happened in Trump\u2019s NDA case. But the original sin of the Steele Dossier birthed the new era of lawfare for the Democrats. As the allegations of Trump\u2019s Russia collusion grew during Trump\u2019s presidency, liberal cable networks found a new salve for their previously slumbering ratings, mainstream print grew new subscribers and previously obscure left wing legal Cassandras got book deals and television contracts. Never mind the absence of any actual evidence of a Trump criminal conspiracy. For the Democratic party, the fantasy of Trump\u2019s criminal relationship with the Russians became near obsession during his presidency. Democrat leaders like Adam Schiff promised hard evidence of the criminality, and liberal television hosts breathlessly parroted supposed confirmatory nuggets in their breathless dawn to dusk coverage. A Columbia Journalism Review investigation later exposed how this culture of opinion journalism had replaced the more serious institution of independent journalism moored by facts, independent investigation and skepticism. When special counsel Robert Mueller exculpated Trump on the Russian collusion but found four possible instances of obstruction of justice, the left, without apology, just moved on. The new charges may have been enough to keep the show going, but the cynicism was unmasked by the fact that the Biden DOJ and all the liberal pundits seem to forget about it once Biden was in office and in position to do something about it. This is not a defense of Trump\u2019s conduct. I was very critical publicly of Trump\u2019s failure to demand that Jan. 6th rioters stand down, his far-fetched theories under the 12th Amendment to overturn certified 2020 election results and his classified documents\u2019 misdeeds. And there should be appropriate consequences for each. But the bigger issue is the somnolent groupthink on the left that endorsed the new legal authoritarianism blinded by bloodlust in the pursuit of lawfare. The Jan. 6th riots occurred over three years ago. Are we really to believe there are no politics behind the DOJ decision (and that of Georgia\u2019s ethically controversial Fani Willis) to delay prosecution until just months before the 2024 election? Is it really okay with Democrats when partisan prosecutors like Alvin Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 deeply conflicted by their political ambitions \u2014 use the immense power of prosecutors to go after political opponents with unprecedented applications of the law? Like Shakespeare\u2019s Antonio, Democrats will be unlikely to cabin their ounce of flesh. They will have less ground to stand on if, for example, a Trump DOJ comes after a former President Biden for his mishandling of classified documents, or Democratic candidates for inevitable campaign reporting disclosure errors. Hunter Biden\u2019s prosecution for allegedly lying on federal gun applications \u2014 a case that would normally never have been brought \u2014 may just be the first instance of the boomerang. And as the lawfare floodgates open, the irony may be that in the Manhattan case the Democrats unleashed a profound threat to our democracy of their own.

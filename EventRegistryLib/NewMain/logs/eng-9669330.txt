Isokinetic tests are considered one of the most objective ways to determine a moving muscle's endurance, strength, and rate of force development, or how fast Flair can develop force in her surgical leg. According to Flair, she needed to be \"in the 40% or less deficit\" compared to her non-injured leg. Essentially, her injured leg's strength needed to be no more than 40% less powerful than her non-injured leg in order to be considered on track for recovery. Flair excitedly shared that the deficit in her quad strength was \"20% or less,\" and that in some measurements, her injured leg was actually stronger than her non-injured leg. These hopeful statistics imply that her recovery is well ahead of schedule, and is going smoothly.\n\nFlair ended the post by expressing an excitement to resume in-ring activity. Several WWE stars extended their good wishes to Flair, with Carmella posting several applause emojis and Dakota Kai expressing her support with some choice muscle emojis.\n\nAs of writing, Flair has been out of action for six months. \"The Queen\" could resume in-ring action in September 2024, at the absolute earliest.

Initially slated to return in the fall of 2024, it appears that her return timeline could have been preponed given the efforts she's been putting up in rehab sessions. As seen in the latest photos, The Queen is literally glowing as the comeback approaches closer.\n\nIn the latest photo posted on her social media account, Charlotte Flair posed a photo captured through a mirror to dazzle in a black gym attire. She possessed a ripped physique which makes us believe that doctors could just be days away from medically clearing her for in-ring action.\n\nCharlotte Flair \"Waited Three Years To Be With\" Andrade In WWE\n\nThis photo came with a peacock emoji while a few days ago, a set of pictures were posted by Charlotte Flair in a white dress with simple sunflower emojis. Offering sunshine vibes, she was also able to spread major fitness goals as her global fanbase keeps on waiting for the much-anticipated return to happen on television.\n\nCharlotte Flair Set To Be A Part Of Horror Thriller Movie Amid 2024 WWE Hiatus\n\nCharlotte Flair's father, the legendary Ric Flair recently appeared on Busted Open Radio to discuss her road to recovery, and he praised all the hard work his daughter is putting up. Mentioning that she is undoubtedly one of the greatest of all time, Ric also proceeded to provide an update on her health and mentioned that she has been way ahead of her doctors in terms of the recovery period,\n\n\"She's so far ahead now in this rehab. But she just has to, you know, keep it in mind that she's gotta follow Dr.'s dues and orders, and it's got to be a nine-month recovery, no matter how good she feels... To be the athlete that she wants to be and do all these Corkscrew Moonsaults and stuff like that, she's got to be at a hundred percent.\" (quotes courtesy Wrestling INC)\n\nIt was on the December 8 2023 episode of Friday Night SmackDown where Charlotte Flair picked up the injury while facing off Asuka in a singles contest. With the other Damage CTRL members present at ringside, this match had a spot where the 14-time women's champion slipped from the top ropes and tore her ACL, MCL, and meniscus. To fix things up, she also underwent surgery at the beginning of 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Flair", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Flair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrade_El_Idolo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrade El Idolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_CTRL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damage CTRL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuka_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asuka (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://sportzwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwe-charlotte-post.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669330", "eventUri": "eng-9669330", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223756782, "title": "No Messi, no problem: Inter Miami downs slumping Vancouver Whitecaps 2-1", "text": "Missing soccer icon Lionel Messi wasn\u2019t an issue for Inter Miami on Saturday. Even without the World Cup-winning superstar, Miami (10-4-2) cruised to a 2-1 victory over the slumping Whitecaps (5-5-4) in Vancouver. Fans were outraged earlier in the week to hear Miami wasn\u2019t bringing Messi to play in B.C. because of the club\u2019s congested Major League Soccer schedule. The team also left Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez and Spanish midfielder Sergio Busquets in Florida. \u201cWe have come without our biggest players. \u2026 And even then, we have competed very well,\u201d Miami\u2019s head coach, Gerardo (Tata) Martino, said through an interpreter. \u201cThat is a very valuable thing, of course. If we had lost, even if we had competed as well as we did tonight, we would not be as happy as we are now. \u201cI think this is a big prize for these players for the effort that they\u2019ve done.\u201d Pink No. 10 Messi jerseys still dotted the announced crowd of 51,035, and \u201cWhere is Messi?\u201d chants broke out in the game\u2019s early minutes. Saturday\u2019s result stretched Vancouver\u2019s winless skid to six games (0-3-3) in MLS play while Miami\u2019s unbeaten streak grew to 10 straight outings (7-0-3). \u201c(Major League Soccer) is like this. Every team goes through this kind of period during the season,\u201d Whitecaps head coach Vanni Sartini said after the loss. \u201cSo it\u2019s too easy to show that we are a compact group when everything is going well. We need to show it now. \u201cAnd so we are conscious of the fact that we need to do better, but also we\u2019re conscious of the fact that we can do better. So we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d Robert Taylor scored and contributed an assist, while Leo Campana also found the back of the net for Miami (10-4-2). Ryan Gauld replied for the \u2019Caps (5-5-4), converting a penalty kick in the 72nd minute. Miami\u2019s Drake Callender made one save and Yohei Takaoka stopped four on-target shots for Vancouver. The \u2019Caps started with an aggressive offence and came tantalizingly close to opening the scoring in the eighth minute. Gauld sent a cross to Fafa Picault at the far post and the striker headed it down, only to see his shot blocked by Marcelo Weigandt. Miami peppered Takaoka with shots across the first half and finally beat the Japanese goalkeeper in the 38th minute. Jordi Alba sent a ball to Taylor, who got around Vancouver defender Mathias Laborda inside the penalty area, then blasted a right-footed shot past Takaoka to put Miami up 1-0. Vancouver did not register a shot on target through the first half, while the visitors logged five. The Whitecaps have struggled to find the back of the net recently, scoring just two goals in their last four MLS games. The club had 14 goals across their first six games of the season. \u201cI think that we\u2019re still doing the same things we were doing earlier on in the year, getting to the right spots and creating chances,\u201d said midfielder Ali Ahmed. \u201cBut it just feels like we\u2019re getting a little unlucky. We have to be better and hold ourselves accountable.\u201d Taylor troubled the \u2019Caps once again in the 54th minute, dancing around Laborda before dishing the ball off to Campana at the top of the six-yard box. Campana then tapped in a shot to give Miami a 2-0 lead in the 54th minute. A video review in the 69th minute gave Vancouver life. Tomas Aviles bodychecked Picault inside the penalty area and, while the foul wasn\u2019t initially called, the play was double-checked by the video assistant referee and a penalty was awarded. Gauld stepped up to take the kick and sent a right-footed shot past a diving Callendar, cutting Vancouver\u2019s deficit to 2-1 in the 72nd minute. The home side continued to press in the final minutes, but couldn\u2019t find the equalizer. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot a matter of confidence at the moment,\u201d Sartini said. \u201cSo we need to reinstate the confidence and try to get points immediately because it\u2019s too easy now to be with the head down, but we need to be with the head up and try to go full speed in (our next game).\u201d The Whitecaps return to action Wednesday when they take on Sporting Kansas City on the road. Miami will host Atlanta United the same night. NOTES: After the announcement Messi would not come to Vancouver, the Whitecaps offered everyone at Saturday\u2019s game a free ticket to another regular-season game in 2024. Saturday marked the first-ever MLS game between Vancouver and Inter Miami. Miami midfielder Julian Gressel made his return to B.C. Place. The 30-year-old made 38 appearances across all competitions for Vancouver between 2022 and 2023, putting up seven goals and nine assists.", "summary": "\u2018We have come without our biggest players. \u2026 And even then, we have competed very well,\u2019 Miami's head coach said after his team\u2019s 2-1 road win.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10525615/mls-miami-beats-whitecaps-no-messi/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLS-Vancouver-Whitecaps-Inter-Miami-no-Messi.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:23:01", "author": "Doyle Potenteau", "authors": ["Doyle Potenteau"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.261}

The Lake County Coroner\u2019s Office identified the man as Timothy Toczylowski on Friday evening. He was a resident of the home, authorities said. First responders found the home leveled after the explosion about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday in Lake Zurich, according to the Lake County sheriff\u2019s office. The man\u2019s body later was recovered from the rubble. Authorities said Toczylowski was identified through dental records. Tiffany Koch told WLS-TV that she heard the explosion, ran outside and saw the nearby house burning. \u201cThere was this loud boom. I don\u2019t even know how to describe it,\u201d Koch said. \u201cIt sounded like a tree fell, but there was no real shaking except for just that quick second.\u201d Two other homes were damaged. A utility company crew had to dig up gas lines to shut off natural gas to the property. That allowed firefighters to put out the flames, authorities said. The coroner's office said Friday the cause of the explosion remains under investigation.", "summary": "Authorities have released the name of a 77-year-old man that was found dead after a house exploded in suburban Chicago Tuesday", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-chicago-b2559171.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/08/15/Fatal_House_Explosion_Illinois_28407.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:07:53", "author": "Via AP news wire", "authors": ["Via AP news wire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.69}

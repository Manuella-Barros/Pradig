Hockley became interim CEO of Cricket Australia in June 2020 after Kevin Roberts resigned amid criticism over COVID-19 management. He was officially appointed as the permanent CEO of the Australian Cricket Board 11 months later.\n\nHockley played a crucial role in managing Cricket Australia through the 2020-21 season during the pandemic. Australia successfully hosted the Test series against India. He also developed a new five-year strategy and secured long-term media deals with Seven West Media, Foxtel Group, and Disney Star.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cricket Australia announced that Nick Hockley will step down as CEO in March 2025. Hockley cited the upcoming busy season and progress on the strategic plan as reasons for his decision. He stated that he would support the board in finding his successor.\n\n\"This was a difficult decision, however following what promises to be a blockbuster summer and with our five-year strategic plan well progressed, this is the right time to pursue another challenge, while giving the Board plenty of time to find its next CEO to build on the strong foundations now in place,\" Hockley said.\n\n\"This is not the time for goodbyes, as I remain completely focussed on the season ahead and supporting the Board on succession and a smooth transition,\" he added.\n\nBefore becoming Cricket Australia's CEO, Hockley led the 2020 Women's T20 World Cup committee. He worked on the 2015 Men's World Cup and the London Olympics. Cricket Australia will search for his successor, with Todd Greenberg, CEO of the Australia Cricketers' Association, being a leading candidate.\n\nMike Baird, Chair of Cricket Australia, announced that Nick Hockley will remain CEO until a replacement is appointed. Baird praised Hockley for guiding the sport through the pandemic and securing long-term deals.\n\n\"As CEO, Nick navigated the sport through a period of unprecedented challenge during the pandemic and has delivered significant growth and stability.

However, following what promises to be a blockbuster summer and with our five-year strategic plan well progressed, this is the right time to pursue another challenge while giving the Board plenty of time to find its next CEO to build on the strong foundations now in place. This is not the time for goodbyes, as I remain completely focused on the season ahead and supporting the Board on succession and a smooth transition,\" said Hockley, as quoted by a Cricket Australia media release.\n\nCA Chairman Mike Baird confirmed that Nick had advised the Board that next summer would be his final one as CEO.\n\n\"As CEO, Nick navigated the sport through a period of unprecedented challenge during the pandemic and has delivered significant growth and stability. Under Nick's leadership, several major deals are now in place--many for the next seven years--and the game is set up for continued success,\" Mike Baird said.\n\n\"As Nick says, his full focus is on delivering another successful summer for our fans, players, broadcasters, partners, and the whole of Australian cricket, and there will be time to celebrate his legacy and achievements when he steps down from the role next year. The timing of Nick's decision allows the Board to ensure a smooth transition, and we will begin the process of finding and appointing his successor shortly,\" Mike Baird added.\n\nHockley is expected to step down towards the end of March 2025, or potentially later depending on the process to appoint his successor.\n\nHockley was appointed interim CEO of Cricket Australia in June 2020 and then permanent CEO eleven months later. Having navigated the sport through two seasons of the pandemic, under Hockley's leadership, CA has since secured the foundations and set cricket on a path for growth with a new five-year strategy, seven-year media deals with Seven West Media, Foxtel Group, and Disney Star in India, a new player MOU with the Australian Cricketers' Association which included a 66% uplift in pay for female professional cricketers, and reset the Big Bash on its current growth trajectory.\n\nOn the playing side, Hockley has overseen a period of remarkable success for Australia's national teams, including Australia's first tour to Pakistan in 24 years, winning and retaining both the women's and men's Ashes, six ICC trophies including the women's and men's Cricket World Cups (2022 and 2023 respectively), the men's and women's T20 World Cups (2021 and 2023), the World Test Championship in 2023, and the Men's Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2024, as well as Commonwealth Games gold in 2022, the release added.\n\nHockley joined Australian cricket in October 2012 as GM Commercial & Marketing of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, which was attended by more than 1 million fans and generated more than $1 billion for the Australian and New Zealand economies.\n\nFollowing a brief stint as Head of Commercial Projects, in 2017 Hockley was appointed CEO of the Local Organising Committee for the ICC T20 World Cup 2020, leading the record-breaking Women's T20 World Cup at which 86,174 fans attended the Final at the MCG.

Under Nick's leadership, several major deals are now in place - many for the next seven years - and the game is set up for continued success.\n\n\"As Nick says, his full focus is on delivering another successful summer for our fans, players, broadcasters, partners and the whole of Australian Cricket and there will be time to celebrate his legacy and achievements when he steps down from the role next year. The timing of Nick's decision allows the Board to ensure a smooth transition and we will begin the process of finding and appointing his successor shortly,\" he said.\n\nHockley was appointed interim CEO of Cricket Australia in June 2020 and then permanent CEO eleven months later. Having navigated the sport through two seasons of the pandemic, under Hockley's leadership CA also reached a new Memorandum of Understanding with the Australian Cricketers' Association, which included a 66% uplift in pay for female professional cricketers, and reset the Big Bash on its current growth trajectory.\n\nOn the playing side, Hockley has overseen a period of remarkable success for Australia's national teams, including Australia's first tour to Pakistan in 24 years, winning and retaining both the women's and men's Ashes, six ICC trophies including the women's and men's Cricket World Cups (2022 and 2023 respectively), the men's and women's T20 World Cups (2021 and 2023), the World Test Championship in 2023 and Men's Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2024, as well as Commonwealth Games gold in 2022.\n\nHaving worked on the organising committee for the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, Hockley joined Australian cricket later that year as General Manager Commercial and Marketing of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, which was attended by more than 1 million fans and generated more than $1 billion for the Australian and New Zealand economies\n\nFollowing a brief stint as head of commercial projects, in 2017 Hockley was appointed CEO of the local organising committee for the ICC T20 World Cup 2020, leading the record-breaking Women's T20 World Cup at which 86,174 fans attended the Final at the MCG.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cricket CEO signals final summer in charge", "body": "Hockley told employees he plans to finish up at Cricket Australia in March.\n\nFormer NRL boss Todd Greenberg could loom as Cricket Australia's next chief executive after Nick Hockley announced this summer would be his last in charge.\n\nHockley told employees on Tuesday he planned to exit his role next March, ending a stint that began in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nGreenberg is one option to replace Hockley, given he currently heads up the Australian Cricketers' Association and has long impressed figures at Cricket Australia (CA).\n\nJames Allsopp, a former chief executive at Cricket ACT, is another after he was elevated to a chief of cricket role at CA last month.\n\nBig Bash League boss Alistair Dobson is also in the mix after reviving the competition in recent years.\n\n\"This was a difficult decision,\" Hockley said in a statement.\n\n\"This is not the time for goodbyes, as I remain completely focused on the season ahead and supporting the board on succession and a smooth transition.\"\n\nHockley's time in charge will be remembered as one of the most dramatic in Cricket Australia's history.\n\nHe took over when Kevin Roberts paid the price for the sport's response to the COVID-19 shut down, midway through 2020.\n\nHockley's early achievements were notable, after a stint in charge of the 2020 Twenty20 World Cup.\n\nWhere the worldwide pandemic broke several sporting administrators, it was largely the making of Hockley.\n\nThe Englishman was able to complete home summers against both India and England, despite border closures and concerns from the travelling teams.\n\nHockley's tenure also included a $1.5 billion TV rights deal signed in early 2023, just months after avoiding a lawsuit from the Seven Network over the standard of the BBL during COVID.\n\nAnd a largely amicable pay deal was reached with Greenberg and the players' association last year, compared to the drama and threats of strikes in 2018.\n\nBut Hockley still had his challenges in the public domain.\n\nThe handling of Justin Langer's axing as men's coach frustrated several former players, as did the fact the West Australian was at one stage offered only a six-month extension before his resignation.\n\nHockley also had to contend with the Tim Paine sexting scandal, with the former Australia captain particularly critical of his handling of the situation in a 2022 autobiography.\n\nDavid Warner's leadership ban also loomed as an issue months later, when Warner withdrew his appeal after an independent body would not allow the hearing to be held in private.\n\n\"As CEO, Nick navigated the sport through a period of unprecedented challenge during the pandemic and has delivered significant growth and stability,\" chairman Mike Baird said.\n\n\"Under Nick's leadership, several major deals are now in place -- many for the next seven years -- and the game is set up for continued success.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus",

from Seven Network over the BBL's standard during COVID.\n\nLast year, a largely amicable agreement was reached with Greenberg and the players' union, compared to the drama and threats of strikes in 2018.\n\nBut Hockley still faced challenges in the public domain.\n\nThe handling of Justin Langer's dismissal as men's national team coach left several former players frustrated, as did the fact that the West Australian was at one point only offered a six-month extension before resigning himself.\n\nHockley has also been caught up in the Tim Paine sexting scandal, with the former Australia captain being particularly critical of his handling of the situation in his 2022 autobiography.\n\nMonths later, David Warner's leadership ban also came up for discussion, when Warner withdrew his appeal after an independent body refused to hold the hearing behind closed doors.\n\n\"As CEO, Nick has led the sport through a period of unprecedented challenges during the pandemic and has delivered significant growth and stability,\" said Chairman Mike Baird.\n\n\"Under Nick's leadership, several major deals have been closed, many of which span the next seven years, and the game is poised for

both India and England, despite border closures and concerns from travelling teams.\n\nHockley's tenure also included a $1.5 billion TV rights deal signed in early 2023, just months after avoiding a lawsuit from the Seven Network over the standard of the BBL during COVID.\n\nAnd one of the most peaceful pay deals was reached last year between him and Greenberg, avoiding the drama of 2018 and allowing for significant wage increases for female domestic players.\n\nHockley's challenges of his tenure largely revolved around the sport's crises, including the handling of Justin Langer's axing as men's coach.\n\nThe CA boss also had to contend with criticism from Tim Paine over the handling of his sexting scandal, and came under the most pressure following David Warner's botched appeal over his leadership ban.\n\nBut throughout his tenure, Hockley largely managed close relationships with the players and assisted in progressive and inclusive causes driven by the likes of Pat Cummins and Usman Khawaja.\n\nHockley's desire to grow the women's game, including the push for more Tests, was also well received by players.\n\nHis flagged resignation came sooner than most suspected at CA on Tuesday, but the chartered accountant is set to remain with the organisation until his successor takes over next year.\n\nIt's believed CA will advertise externally for the role, but several within cricket already loom as favourites.\n\nGreenberg is one of those, with four years of experience in running the NRL before becoming the players' association CEO in 2021.\n\nDobson, a former head of marketing for the AFL, has reinvigorated the BBL and WBBL in recent seasons.\n\nAllsopp previously served as Cricket ACT's CEO and has roots back to coaching in the sport before entering CA's executive as head of community cricket in 2021.\n\nMatthews recently stepped aside as Cricket WA's CEO after years of success in the west, while Cummins impressed across several states.", "source":

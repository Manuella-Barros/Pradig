Your skepticism is the skepticism of Nigerians. I want to assure you that we will compel the attendance of anyone invited. We will do what is in the overriding public interest. We will do our duty without fear or favour.\n\n\"There will be no sacred cows. We will look into all the accusations and counter-accusations between Dangote and other stakeholders in the petroleum sector,\" Bamidele assured.\n\nHe observed further that, in the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Assemblies, there was no law to guide the operations of the Petroleum industry just as he noted that a law is now available to guide and control activities of the sector, saying: \"there was no Petroleum Industry Act in the past Assemblies but now, we have a law upon which we can anchor and carry out this investigation.\"\n\nThe Committee was set up by the Senate in plenary on Wednesday, July 3, 2024, through a resolution adopted after exhaustive debate by Senators on a motion sponsored by Senator Azuquo Ekpenyong (APC Cross River South) on the importation of Hazardous Products and dumping of substandard Diesel into Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further, Bamidele said: \"The rationale for this news conference is pure and simple. It mainly borders on the alleged economic sabotage in the petroleum industry. including the recent accusations and counter of importation of petroleum products into the country.\n\n\"Given its consequences on our domestic economy, the Senate under the able leadership of The President of the Senate, Senator Gadswill Akpabio, constituted this 15-man Ad-hoc Committee to investigate Alleged Economic Sabotage in the Nigerian Petroleum Industry on July 3, 2024.\n\n\"Specifically, the committee as mandated by the Senate, would examine the pre-shipment and pre-discharge standard test parameters adopted by the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority with a view to uncovering loopholes, if any, being exploited to get toxic cargoes into the country.\n\n\"Determine the level of compliance of the NNPCL's Direct Sale and Direct Purchase (DSP) arrangements in line with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act, including the extent of transparency and accountability. Beam legislative searchlight on the activities of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), including payments made to transporters in the last 10 years.\n\n\"Enquire from the NNPCL the state/status of the 22 depots built by the defunct NNPC to eliminate road distribution of petroleum products. Engage with stakeholders within the oil and gas industry to identify possible gaps in regulating and strengthening the surveillance and monitoring structures in place to enable Nigeria to detect violations of best practice standards in the importation of products before they enter into the domestic supply chains.\n\n\"Also engage with the NNPCL to understand the extent of its determination and timelines for the start-up of government-funded oil refineries. Investigate how institutions across the importation and distribution chain failed to conduct quality sampling, shipped in products without auditing, and performed port validations by the Nigeria Customs Service, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON); and Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA).\"\n\nConsequently, according to the Chairman, the 15-man Committee has resolved to carry out the investigations holistically and thoroughly and has written all the relevant stakeholders in the sector for submission of relevant documents and appearance before it during the public hearing, fixed for September 10th to September 12th, 2024.\n\nIn their separate remarks at the press briefing, all the members of the Committee vowed to unravel the rot in the sector and declared that it would no longer be business as usual.\n\nAccording to them, their integrity is at stake and there would be no room for sacred cows, declaring \" that warrant of arrest would be issued on any head of agency who refuses to honour invitation for appearance.\"\n\nMembers of the Committee are

The panel aims to scrutinize the pre-shipment and pre-discharge testing standards of the NMDPRA to uncover potential vulnerabilities that may allow toxic products into Nigeria.\n\nAdditionally, it will assess the compliance of NNPCL's Direct Sale and Direct Purchase (DSP) agreements with the Petroleum Industry Act, focusing on transparency and accountability.\n\nThe Ad-hoc committee will also review payments to transporters over the past decade and investigate the status of 22 depots constructed by the defunct NNPC, which were intended to reduce road distribution of petroleum products.\n\nThe committee plans to engage with industry stakeholders to identify regulatory gaps and improve monitoring mechanisms to prevent violations of importation standards. It will also seek to understand the NNPCL's plans and timelines for restarting government-funded oil refineries.\n\nBamidele emphasized that the probe would involve on-site assessments and a review of turnaround maintenance (TAM) contracts for Nigeria's four refineries, which have incurred significant costs with little to show for it.\n\nAddressing public skepticism about past probes, Bamidele promised that this investigation would be conducted with integrity and thoroughness, ensuring accountability. He noted that malpractices in the past were often due to the lack of a regulatory framework but stressed that the current Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) would guide the panel's recommendations.\n\n\"The Senate Ad-Hoc Committee on Alleged Economic Sabotage in the Petroleum Industry is committed to protecting the interests of Nigerians and restoring confidence in our energy sector,\" Bamidele stated.\n\nHe assured that anyone found guilty of economic sabotage, regardless of their position, would face consequences. \"There will be no sacred cows,\" he declared.\n\nThe public hearing for this investigation is set to commence on September 10.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ikenna_ngere@naijanews.com", "name":

Minister of State for Petroleum, Heineken Lokpobiri, among others, for questioning over alleged economic sabotage in the country's petroleum industry.\n\nThe upper chamber, further, disclosed that it would investigate billions of dollars that had been spent on turnaround maintenance of the state-owned refineries in the last decade with a view to addressing deep-rooted challenges facing the industry.\n\nThe Leader of the Senate and Chairman, Senate Ad-hoc Committee on Alleged Economic Sabotage in the Nigerian Petroleum Industry, Opeyemi Bamidele, reeled out the plans at a news conference he addressed alongside other members of the ad-hoc committee at the Public Accounts Hearing Room 4, National Assembly Complex, Abuja on Thursday.\n\nThe news conference was organised to educate the public on the mandates, workings, and of course the modalities adopted by the ad-hoc committee, which the Senate constituted on July 3 to investigate allegations of economic sabotage in the country's petroleum industry.\n\nAfter its inauguration last Monday, President of the Senate, Senator Godswill Akpabio charged the 15-man ad-hoc committee to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the allegations within three weeks.\n\nSpeaking at the conference on Thursday, Bamidele pledged to carry out holistic investigation into the allegations of economic sabotage in Nigeria's petroleum industry.\n\nThe chairman of the ad-hoc committee also assured Nigerians that the ad-hoc committee would carry out a thorough investigation into diverse reasons the state-owned refineries have not been operational for years despite budget earmarked for turnaround maintenance.\n\nSpecifically, Bamidele noted that the contractors handling the turnaround maintenance for the refineries would be invited to let the committee on the situation of things.\n\nBamidele added that the investigation would not be an armchair investigation, pointing out that members of the ad-hoc committee had already set machinery in motion to visit Lagos, Port Harcourt and Warri to engage key actors in the petroleum industry.\n\nHe said: \"It is pertinent to note that in the course of interactions with the identified stakeholders, the ad-hoc committee will visit any of their facilities that it deems necessary, especially the state-owned refineries, to ascertain their status, considering the funds already invested in the various turn around maintenances years without any meaningful result.\n\n\"The ad-hoc committee is particularly interested in understanding why local refineries are not working despite the substantial amounts of money spent annually on their maintenance and operations. We will closely examine what the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited has been doing to address this persistent problem.\"\n\nHe further revealed that the ad-hoc committee had identified some critical stakeholders to interact with in the course of discharging this noble assignment\n\nThe stakeholders, according to him, Federal Ministry of Finance, Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Standards Organisation of Nigeria, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Nigeria Customs Service, Nigerian Navy, Obat Oil and Petroleum Limited, Matrix Energy Depot\n\nIndependent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, International Oil Companies (IOCs), Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria,\n\nCapital Oil and Modular Refineries.\n\nBamidele added that the ad-hoc committee \"will meet with stakeholders in their various zones to gather localised insights and feedback. To ensure broad participation and transparency, the ad-hoc committee will create a platform for the general public and stakeholders to submit memoranda before the public hearings.\"\n\nHe categorically stated that part of the mandate of the committee meant \"to uncover parties involved in the importation of adulterated fuel and diesel into the country.\n\n\"Our investigation seeks to identify and hold accountable all parties involved in the importation and distribution of the adulterated petroleum products. This includes suppliers, importers, regulatory bodies, and any other entities that may have contributed to this serious lapse in quality control.\n\n\"We will conduct a thorough review of current regulatory frameworks and procedures to identify deficiencies and recommend necessary reforms to prevent such occurrences in the future. The Committee is committed to ensuring the highest standards of fuel quality for the Nigerian market.\"\n\nBamidele noted that the ad-hoc committee would beam legislative searchlight on the activities of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, including payments made to transporters in the last 10 years.\n\nHe noted that the ad-hoc committee would enquire from the NNPCL the state and status of the 22 depots built by the defunct NNPC to eliminate road distribution of petroleum products.\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to various stakeholders \"to cooperate with the committee so that there can be lasting solutions to problems in the oil sector. Our mandate is of strategic national interests.\n\n\"Each member of the committee is carefully selected based on his/her records of sterling performance. We are all men of integrity who will never pursue selfish interests at the expense of the national interests.\n\n\"The Senate did not constitute this committee to intimidate and witch-hunt any party. Rather, the committee was constituted for the purpose of ensuring social and economic justice in the light of grim realities we are facing as a federation.\n\n\"We are also taking this task seriously with a view to addressing fundamental issues that pose grave threats to our economic prosperity, fiscal stability and public health as a federation.\n\n\"In line with our mandate, we will definitely unravel the roots of economic sabotage in Nigeria's petroleum industry and make necessary recommendations that will entrench global best practices in the industry and open it up for more investments, especially in the midstream and downstream sectors.\n\n\"We are utterly committed to this mandate. We shall also carry out this national assignment without fear or favour. We shall be fair and just to all parties with a view to promoting and protecting the strategic national interests of our fatherland.\"", "source": {"uri": "theeagleonline.com.ng", "dataType": "news",

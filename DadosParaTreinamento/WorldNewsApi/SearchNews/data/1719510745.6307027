The Red Devils were big underdogs heading into Saturday's season finale against Manchester City at Wembley but beat their neighbours 2-1 to end a challenging season with silverware. Gallagher, a staunch City fan, was involved in some light-hearted banter with United legend Gary Neville in the build-up to the final, with the Sky Sports pundit quipping that the Oasis megastar shouldn't be commenting on Manchester as he lives in London. And in the wake of City's defeat at Wembley, Hojlund has rubbed salt in Gallagher's wounds with a cheeky social media post revelling in United's victory. The Danish striker, 21, uploaded an image of himself, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad Diallo standing with the FA Cup alongside the caption: \"Since Manchester is red, this is the new wonderwall.\" The post, making light of one of Oasis' biggest songs, Wonderwall, went down a treat with gleeful Manchester United fans on social media as they celebrated their big win. Victory at Wembley means that Erik ten Hag has now won two trophies in as many years at Manchester United, however, the Dutchman's long-term future remains unclear. Join the debate! Do you think Man Utd should stick with Ten Hag? Let us know here. Ten Hag has overseen United's worst league campaign in over 30 years after finishing eighth in the Premier League and, as a result, is at real risk of losing his job this summer. Speculation was rife on the eve of the match that United's top brass, led by part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, had already decided to sack him regardless of the outcome at Wembley. But a defiant Ten Hag insisted he would simply 'go elsewhere and win trophies' if he was not wanted at Old Trafford. He did, however, reveal that Ineos have reiterated that they would like to keep working together ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Ten Hag, who is now set to head off on holiday, was asked by reporters if he still felt he had the support of the hierarchy and replied: \"That is what they always tell me. I don't have doubt but of course it's not up to me. I don\u2019t know if they have done this [spoken to other managers]. I can\u2019t answer this question.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

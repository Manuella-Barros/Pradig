{"id": 225034534, "title": "Taxi driver, 21, says people are 'shocked' when they see her at the wheel", "text": "A 21-year-old taxi driver has revealed that passengers are often \"surprised\" to see her behind the wheel - with many assuming she's much younger than she is. Abi Mar, from Blanchardstown in Dublin, Ireland, shared how she frequently faces a flurry of questions from baffled passengers expecting a middle-aged man when she arrives. The young woman followed in her father Mihai's footsteps and became a taxi driver 18 months ago, at just 19. Abi said: \"People would be surprised, they'd always say something when they get into the car - they'd say 'oh it's very rare to have a female driver' or 'how old are you if you don't mind me asking?' They always ask questions along those sorts of lines. \"Some of them don't believe my age. Some people think I'm younger than I am. I'd love to know if there is anybody similar to my age because I haven't come across any other young females.\" Abi also disclosed that driving a taxi around Dublin is \"way safer\" than her previous job delivering takeaways for a local chip shop. She explained that most of her work now comes through apps like Free Now, Bolt, and Uber, where customer details are traceable, unlike with food deliveries where anyone could answer the door, reports the Irish Mirror. Abi said: \"I didn't have any bad experiences as a delivery driver but it never felt very safe. I'd be dealing with cash most of the time. I'd be knocking on people's doors at 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning. \"You don't know who's going to open that door. You don't know if they're going to pay you. I'd say you're more vulnerable delivering food than you would be driving taxis. Everything is your choice driving a taxi but working in the chipper you didn't have a choice. If there was an area you didn't want to drop off to that's tough - you have to do it. \"I definitely feel more secure as a taxi driver especially because you have their names, you're paid already. If you were to compare the two - driving a taxi is way safer than delivering food.\" The 21-year-old also revealed that a few passengers have recognised her from her appearance on RTE's First Dates. However, this isn't the only time her love life has been a topic of conversation while transporting people. Abi confessed that some men have asked for her phone number after completing a fare, while others have invited her to join them at the pub. But she simply laughs off any advances. She added: \"I've had more women who've come across a bit rude towards me than I've had men saying anything to me but you just get on with it, drop them off, get your money, and move on to the next customer.\" She applies \"common sense\" when picking up fares from the street, typically only accepting couples and families. Abi has quickly become a TikTok sensation, amassing over 11,000 followers by sharing her experiences as a taxi driver. She works from 6pm to midnight on weekdays and switches to daytime hours over the weekend, steering clear of the early morning shifts when things tend to get rowdier. She explained her cautious approach: \"My dad from the start said I'll build confidence picking up from the street because it's down to common sense. You won't pick somebody up if they have a beer in their hand or you won't pick up a group of young fellas. You'd be looking for couples or a family. I tend not to pick people up off the street at night time because you can't really see who you're picking up.\" To qualify as a taxi driver, Abi had to pass an exam on Dublin's geography and initially, only one company agreed to insure her, costing her a hefty \u20ac9,000 for the first year's policy. However, she believes the investment has paid off. Renting her taxi plate from her father, Abi shared: \"The majority of my friends think I'm mad. You get out what you put in. If you put your head down and keep on picking up jobs - the money adds up fairly quickly. Although you need to consider your expenses, you get an idea of how much you need to earn in a week. It's a hard start but the price will go down. It does get easier.\" Abi, who left school at 15 to work with horses on a stud farm, shared her unconventional path to success, emphasizing that traditional education isn't the only way to achieve one's dreams. She explained: \"My advice would be to follow your gut and don't let other people make the decision for you. My family have always been very open and said 'Abi, it's your life, you do what you want and follow your gut and follow your heart.' \"There's no right or wrong job in life. Enjoying the job you do is the most important part. I'm probably at my happiest now because I followed my heart.\"", "summary": "Abi Mar, a 21 year old taxi driver from Dublin, said people can't believe their eyes when they see her behind the wheel - with many thinking she's much younger than she actually is", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/taxi-driver-21-says-people-32917237", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article32917234.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_abi-mar-taxi-driver.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:36:08", "author": "Danny De Vaal,Rom Preston-Ellis", "authors": ["Danny De Vaal", "Rom Preston-Ellis"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.127}

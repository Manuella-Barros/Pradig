But an addition to one Greater Manchester cemetery is aiming to help people who are struggling with loss. Tameside Council has installed the 'Post Box to Heaven' at Dukinfield Cemetery. Standing on the main drive, by the Prospect Road gates, the post box gives people the chance to get whatever is on their mind down in writing, with the aim of bringing peace in a difficult time. Coun Denise Ward, Tameside Council\u2019s executive member for environmental services, said: \u201cI know from personal experience what\u2019s like to lose a loved one. There\u2019s a sense of numbness and depression - some people might even be angry that they\u2019ve been left alone - but that sensation can be calmed by expressing ourselves and getting things off our chest.

It\u2019s an idea that has been extremely popular at other local authorities and it\u2019s proving to be the same in Tameside. We\u2019ve had an incredible response.\u201d The 'Post Box to Heaven' is available whenever Dukinfield Cemetery is open, for anyone who feels they might benefit from it. Tameside Council says all posted items are entirely private, with none ever opened, read or replied to, and stamps are not required.", "summary": "&quot;It's an idea that has been extremely popular&quot;", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/new-post-box-helping-people-29258279", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29258244.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_postbox.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:16:50", "author": "Stephen Topping", "authors": ["Stephen Topping"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.24}

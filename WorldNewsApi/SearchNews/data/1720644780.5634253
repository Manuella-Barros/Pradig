At a meeting of party MPs, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge proposed Sonia Gandhi\u2019s name as the chairperson of the parliamentary party. The proposal was seconded by Gaurav Gogoi, K Sudhakaran and Tariq Anwar. Gandhi, 77, was elected to the Rajya Sabha in February. Earlier, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) unanimously urged Rahul Gandhi to take on the mantle of the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and he told the party\u2019s top brass that he will take a decision on it \u201cvery soon\u201d. Sonia Gandhi described the Lok Sabha election results as \u201cpolitical and moral defeat\u201d of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he has lost the moral right to leadership. Addressing the newly elected MPs in the Central Hall of Parliament, she said far from taking responsibility for the failure, the prime minister intends to get himself sworn in again Sunday. \u201cWe do not expect him to change the substance and style of his governance, nor take cognisance of the will of the people,\u201d Sonia Gandhi said. She said the prime minister had sought the mandate solely in his name to the exclusion of both his party and its allies, but has suffered a political and moral defeat. \u201cIn reality, he has lost the mandate he sought and thereby has lost the right to leadership as well. Yet, far from taking the responsibility for failure he intends to get himself sworn in again tomorrow. We do not expect him to change the substance and style of his governance, nor take cognisance of the will of the people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why, as members of the CPP, we have a special obligation to be watchful, vigilant and proactive in holding him and his new NDA government accountable. \u201cNo longer can and should bulldoze Parliament like it has been for a decade now. No longer will the writ of the ruling establishment be permitted to disrupt Parliament, whimsically mistreat members or push through legislation without due and proper consideration and debate. \u201cNo longer can and should parliamentary committees be ignored or by-passed like they have been since 2014. No longer will Parliament be muzzled and stifled as it has been over the past 10 years,\u201d the CPP chief said. Observing that the times ahead were challenging, she told the Congress MPs that they have to be alert to prevent any attempts to increase polarisation and erosion of secular and democratic values enshrined in our Constitution by the ruling cabal. All such attempts have to be thwarted, she said. The Congress leader also said the Congress is also being bolstered by the strength of the INDIA bloc allies. \u201cOur numbers in Parliament have increased significantly. Not only is the Indian National Congress a large contingent in the Lok Sabha but we are bolstered by the strength of our INDIA partners some of whom have themselves come back impressively,\u201d she said. She also said the Bharat Jodo yatras were \u201chistoric movements\u201d. \u201cRahul deserves special thanks for his tenacity and determination to fight on in the face of unprecedented personal and political attacks. He also shaped our narrative on guarantees and protection of the Constitution very sharply,\u201d she said. Sonia Gandhi, however, cautioned the MPs to reflect on what needs to be done to improve its position in the states where performance has been below expectation.

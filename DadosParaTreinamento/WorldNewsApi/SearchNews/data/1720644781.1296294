I did interviews and they were like, \u2018How are you?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I\u2019m thriving.\u2019 I was so happy\u2026And then, right before my last interview, I look down and I\u2019m gushing blood\u2026Oh no,\u2019 and they\u2019re like \u2018Okay, Ryan Seacrest is on. Go!\u2019,\u201d shared the 30-year-old. The \u201cAll About That Bass\u201c singer revealed this the day she found out that she was pregnant with Barry, whom she shares with Daryl Sabra. They also have another son named Riley. Having a background in motherhood, the blood put her in a state of stress, Meghan explained. \u201cI did that whole interview like, \u2018don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry\u2019 and then got through it. I shut the computer and was like, \u2018Hey team I think I\u2019m miscarrying right now\u2026I went to the bathroom and saw what was happening, and I was like, \u2018Alright I had a baby this morning and now they\u2019re gone.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I\u2019m just gonna keep testing,\u2019 and the pregnancy stick still said positive,\u201d she added. This hiccup in her pregnancy led her to get checked but found an even bigger surprise. \u201cI got a blood test done, and it\u2019s like the number is zero if you\u2019re not pregnant. My number was 90,000\u2026At six weeks, I went in and she goes, \u2018Woah, that\u2019s a 10-week-old baby.\u2019 So I was pregnant ever since the [Jimmy] Fallon performance,\u201d Meghan said. The \u201cmiscarriage\u201d in which Meghan referred to is actually known as implantation bleeding, which happens \u201c10 to 14 days after conception\u201d and it is very common. Per Mayo Clinic, it is \u201c thought to happen when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus\u2026usually occurs around the time you would expect to have a menstrual period.\u201d In other news, the \u201cLips Are Movin\u2019\u201d singer released her brand-new album, Timeless, on Friday, June 7.

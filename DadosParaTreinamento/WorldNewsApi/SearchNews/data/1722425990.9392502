The man, who is in his 60s, is understood to have been taken to the local police station after a van and a police car arrived at his house in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, The Sun reports. Herefordshire Constabulary later confirmed that he was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence. Cops confirmed the man who was detained related to a Channel 4 undercover investigation into Nigel Farage's Reform campaign in Clacton. In the report, an activist was caught on camera branding the Prime Minister a 'f***ing p***' - with Sunak later saying Farage had 'questions to answer' regarding the incident. He was also secretly recorded by Channel 4 News in Essex suggesting that migrants should be shot by soldiers as they arrive on UK beaches. He also called for Muslims to be ejected from mosques so they can be turned into Wetherspoons pubs. The PM, whose grandparents were from India, likened the language to that used by 'misogynist' Andrew Tate and repeated the racial slur used against him 'because it is important to call it out for what it is', citing the impact on his young daughters. He said: 'My two daughters have to see and hear Reform people who campaign for Nigel Farage calling me an effing p***. It hurts and it makes me angry, and I think he has some questions to answer. 'I don't repeat those words lightly. I do so deliberately, because this is too important not to call out clearly for what it is.' 'Officers arrested a man in his 60s earlier today on suspicion of causing a public order offence,' a spokesperson for Hertfordshire Constabulary told The Sun. 'Following further and liaison with Essex Police he is being released with no further action.' Mr Farage called the language 'vulgar, drunken and wrong', and, when asked about candidates who had made racist or xenophobic comments on BBC Question Time last night, he added: 'I wouldn't want anything to do with them'. He also repeated claims that it was a 'set up'. Reform chairman Richard Tice last night revealed to The Sun that they had sacked three members of staff after the Channel 4 documentary.", "summary": "The man, who is in his 60s, is understood to have been taken to the local police station after a van and a police car arrived at his house in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, The Sun reports.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13581959/Man-60s-arrested-released-no-action-racist-comments-Rishi-Sunak.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/29/00/86695753-0-image-m-65_1719616784467.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:17:24", "author": "Editor,Iwan Stone", "authors": ["Editor", "Iwan Stone"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.444}

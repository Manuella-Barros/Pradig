The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law. In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.\n\n\"What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,\" the report read, according to Dawn. According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.\n\nThe report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that the practice of extrajudicial killings continued while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings witnessed a rise. According to the report, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country, like what happened in previous years, Dawn reported. The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.\n\nThe report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man. The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'\n\nSpeaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported. HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health. He also expressed concern over the low rate of trade unionisation. HRCP Islamabad Vice-Chair Nasreen Azhar said religion continued to be 'weaponized for political purposes'.

What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low.\n\n\"The state's response to the 9 May riots was to quell dissent -- to the extent of resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders. The right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. The general elections were also delayed well beyond the 90-day constitutional limit on various grounds, including the need for new delimitations on the basis of the recent census,\" said the report.\n\nThe rule of law was markedly poor, with a record six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations and two militant attacks in Bajaur and Mastung, that collectively left at least 117 dead. The practice of extrajudicial killings continued, while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings surged, said the report.\n\nAs in previous years, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country. In an admirable show of strength, however, young Baloch women mobilized a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.\n\nAmong vulnerable groups, religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, especially in the aftermath of an attack in Jaranwala, Punjab, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs, following allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man. In the wake of the federal government's decision to expel undocumented foreigners. Afghan nationals in particular were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres with little to no legal recourse.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said that the 2023 economic crisis had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.' Commenting on the high incidence of enforced disappearances, he also deplored the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances as 'disgraceful.'\n\nHRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt said that it was critical for the state to fulfil people's right to education, livelihood and health.

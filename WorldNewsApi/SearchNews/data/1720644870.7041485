The annual festival in Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria, is billed as the largest gathering of travellers in Europe and is expected to attract around 40,000 visitors from across the UK over the weekend. Visitors, often with booze flowing freely, gather along the banks of the River Eden horses are taken into the water in order to be washed. The young and old revellers watching the spectacle are all usually dressed to impress. Women don head-to-toe designer gear from fashion houses including Gucci and Louis Vuitton, often paired with heavy makeup and false eyelashes. While the men wore their best tracksuits from sporty brands ranging from Adidas to Under Armour. However, this years fair has already been marred in controversy after it was revealed on Wednesday that a three-year-old stallion was 'worked to death' in an 'inexcusable act of cruelty' after it was found 'covered in rub sores' with a very high temperature. Cumbria Police have since made two arrests in relation with the incident. The force said they were called to assist the RSPCA who had 'difficulty' being allowed access to horses by 'obstructive owners'. The Cumberland and Westmorland Herald reported today that the investigation into the death is moving forward. RSPCA chief inspector Rob Melloy said: 'The horse's temperature was very high, and he was covered in rubs. He had been worked until he dropped. This was an inexcusable act of cruelty. This person has let themselves, their family and of course this poor horse down, who undoubtedly suffered before he died.' Despite the incidents revellers were determined to have a good time. Laura Cassidy, 23, said: 'Appleby is always a big event in the calendar for travellers, and of course everyone wants to dress up and look their best. 'You might be trudging around in a field or riding a horse, but that doesn't mean you can't look the part. Travellers have always been concerned about how they look. Who doesn't want to look good.' Another traveller who asked not to be named said: 'This is an annual event and it is chance to get together with old friends. There is lots to see and do. It is not just looking at horses. 'Of course girls want to dress up. If they are single, it is a chance to impress the boys. Appleby is a great place for families, but it is also a great place to find a new boyfriend if you want one.' Local residents in the town which normally has 3,000 people have mixed feelings about the event which effectively takes over their town with streets being blocked off and one way systems set up. While some profit from turning their fields into \u00a310-a-day car parks, others have become fed up with the disruption, and many leave the town for the duration of the fair. Rows of shops and three of the town's four pubs have closed along with the local library. But the Co-op, a greengrocers, the town's two butchers, two cafes and even a traditional sweet shop have remained open to cater for the influx of visitors. Shops that have closed include a carpet store, a gift shop, travel agents and a clothing shop which also does dry cleaning. Chris Wilson who runs the Sugar and Spice sweet shop said: 'We love the fair and I have no problems staying open. 'Of course there are some little idiots, but you get one per cent who are troublemakers everywhere. There are lads in this town who I wouldn't let in. I don't take much more than normal, although tomorrow I will probably do double my usual business.' Michael Dowding who runs N & J Dowding Family Butchers, said: 'We are working our normal hours. We don't see many locals for the week because so many people leave town, but plenty of travellers come in. 'They like stuff that they can cook on barbecues like steaks, lamb, burgers and sausages. They appreciate getting quality for their money. We don't have any problems with them.' Davina Osman, 78, who runs the Collectable bric-a-brac shop in the town, said: 'I personally have a good time with the fair here. There are older members of the travelling community who enjoy old things and like to come in.' Meanwhile, the Public Hall has opened its doors for travellers to set up stalls selling Romani memorabilia Food stalls flogging burgers, chips, hot dogs, curries, doughnuts, giros and other fast food have lined the streets. Meanwhile the market stall area features stalls selling baby glamour wear, alongside household items like water pails, as well as designer sunglasses and faux designer goods. Rosina Phillips, 71, of south Wales who was visiting the fair with her border collie Bronwen said: 'It is a magical atmosphere. It is so beautiful seeing the horses, and listening to all the sounds of people laughing and being happy.' The Appleby Horse Fair has a long history dating as far back as the 17th century. However, the modern version of the annual fair began in the early 1900s when it evolved into a major event for the travellers community. Alongside the traditional washing of the horses in the river, on a nearby campsite revellers can buy clothes and good, listen to buskers and even visit a fortune teller. The fair continues until Wednesday.", "summary": "The annual festival in Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria, is billed as the largest gathering of travellers in Europe and is expected to attract around 40,000 visitors from across the UK over the weekend.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13508803/Travellers-no-BB-guns-catapults-Appleby-Horse-Fair-traditional-gathering.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/15/85873921-0-image-m-51_1717857866596.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:53:09", "author": "Daily,Editor", "authors": ["Daily", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.072}

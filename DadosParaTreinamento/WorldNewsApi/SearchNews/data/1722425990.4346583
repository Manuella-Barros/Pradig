And this is coming from someone who loves lip products and frankly has too many. This lip oil is so plush, and plumping, and shiny like no other. It also lasts for hourssssss! Lip products, especially glosses, hardly ever last more than an hour. I wore this to work one day, and it was still on after six hours. It\u2019s also absolutely gorgeous in person; the pics don\u2019t do it justice. The teeny tiny gold glitters throughout the lip oil and the packaging itself is actually pretty glam. Plus, it smells like vanilla cake. Which is always good. Basically, I think everyone should try this gloss, but then it\u2019s gonna be even harder for me to find the dang thing in stores than it already is.\" \u2014AP Price: $18", "summary": "<h1>Little luxuries that won't break the bank.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/1/1/enhanced/d4f194b24b39/original-854-1717205825-3.jpg?crop=1245:830;3,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/yiyang/cheap-target-products-thatll-increase-the-fanciness\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/yiyang/cheap-target-products-thatll-increase-the-fanciness", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/1/1/campaign_images/b29a4dbf2f3a/20-cheap-target-products-thatll-increase-the-fanc-3-12005-1717206073-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:01:04", "author": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,Yi Yang", "authors": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "Yi Yang"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.14}

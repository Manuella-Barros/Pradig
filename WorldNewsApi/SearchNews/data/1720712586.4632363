{"id": 232048324, "title": "Historic Glasgow Meat Market redevelopment to include sports hub and padel tennis", "text": "A historic Meat Market in Glasgow\u2019s East End could soon be turned into a sports hub with a bar bistro and upcycling centre. The Meat Market Regeneration Community Interest Company has drawn up proposals that would be created under or beside the B-listed sheds. The plans include a sports hub, padel tennis courts, an enterprise centre with co-working space and an upcycling centre with workshop. All of the new buildings would be under the Meat Market shed roof apart from the sports hub which would be a new-build due to its height. A project to restore and repurpose the derelict sheds and surrounding vacant land is now in phase three as part of a 25-year community lease. The site will also feature a linear park, some sheds refurbished and hundreds of flats for mid-market and social rent. A design statement submitted to Glasgow City Council outlines: \u201cProposals include repair and refurbishment ofhistoric Category B Listed boundary walls and gates, and associated roads access, parking and landscaping. \u201cThe proposal is to conserve and renovate the category B listed Glasgow Meat Market shed structures into a multi-purpose but unified site in the heart of the East End of Glasgow. \u201cThe renovated and re-imagined space will provide a new sports hub providing the future home of a number of multi sports facilities and the base for a national sporting organisation, on site provision, accessible to the local community, for Padel Tennis, create one of a network of new circular economy recycling re-use hubs, a bar/bistro facility and covered open multipurpose events space under the canopy of the refurbished shed structures. \u201cAt the centre of this will be a modest enterprise and training space that will place learning and entrepreneurship at the heart of the project whilst the history, heritage and local cultural importance of the site will be captured by new heritage resources available on the site and online. \u201cThrough a future phase and from a separate building, an active travel hub will be part of the wider vision and embedded in this unified vision for the site. \u201cIn the heart of the East End of Glasgow surrounded by established communities, beside the emerging new mid-market housing development and opposite Bellgrove train station, an integral hub on Glasgow City Council\u2019s developing City Metro Strategy, this will invest in an important heritage asset and create significanteconomic impact in an area of relative deprivation.\u201d The plans are due to go before Glasgow City Council.", "summary": "The B-listed Glasgow Meat Market will be 'conserved and renovated' under new plans.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/west-central/historic-glasgow-meat-market-redevelopment-to-include-sports-hub-and-padel-tennis", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/28ce34b933c1235ed4947718bde36775-1717946171.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:35:04", "author": "Holly Lennon", "authors": ["Holly Lennon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": 0.267}

At the time, the tick-borne illness was only responsible for a few hundred infections a year in Canada, according to government statistics. But cases of Lyme disease have now increased more than 1,000 per cent in a decade as the warming climate pushes the boundaries of a range of pathogens and risk factors northward. Populations of exotic mosquito species that could potentially carry illnesses such as dengue and yellow fever have become established in parts of Ontario, researchers say. Scientists also worry climate change will increase the risks of microbial disease associated with food contamination and warm weather. Wood\u2019s experience had at least one positive. It set him on a career path, and he now runs a private lab in Ontario called Geneticks dedicated to testing ticks for diseases. He said his work allows him to meet many people left \u201cheavily, heavily disabled\u201d from Lyme disease. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very severe and the symptoms can be very, very diverse but very, very debilitating.\u201d Health Canada says symptoms range from rashes and headaches to severe joint pain and memory loss.

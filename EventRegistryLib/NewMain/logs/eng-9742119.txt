The media availability was cut off right there.\n\nPACKERS' JORDAN LOVE REMAINING FOCUSED ON 'GETTING READY FOR THE SEASON' AMID CONTRACT EXTENSION UNCERTAINTY\n\nIf the Packers are unable to reach a long-term extension with Love at any point this season, he will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season.\n\nLove would surely be one of the top free agents on the market if that was the case, but the Packers have seen enough to believe he can be their franchise quarterback for years to come following the trade of Aaron Rodgers to the New York Jets.\n\nLove completed 64.2% of his passes last season, throwing for 4,159 yards with 32 touchdowns and 11 interceptions over 17 games.\n\nHis most impressive start, though, came in the NFC Wild Card Round when he led the Packers to a 48-32 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on the road at AT&T Stadium.\n\nLove threw only 21 passes but completed 16 of them for 272 yards and three touchdowns. It was his first playoff action in the NFL, and he defeated the No. 2 seed in the NFC on their home turf.\n\nHe wasn't as successful against the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round, throwing for 194 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, but the Packers lost by only three points as the 49ers needed to come from behind late in the game.\n\nThe future appears bright for Love after his breakout year, and with young receivers around him and a new running back in Josh Jacobs, the offense is primed to have another solid year production-wise with him under center.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut until a new contract extension is inked on paper, reporters are likely going to keep asking Love about his future in Green Bay.

Brian Gutekunst spoke as if it was a matter of when and not if earlier in the offseason, and Love spoke on what an extension would mean for him in a previous media appearance.\n\n\"That would mean a lot to me,\" Love said, according to Alper. \"That would be awesome. To be able to sign an extension with the team that drafted you is something that all players dream of. Hopefully, that happens here in the future, but I'm excited for the upcoming season and what's in store for our team and to be able to solidify something long-term here in Green Bay.\"\n\nTraining camp starts next week for the Packers, so there could be some news on Love's contract in the near future. It will be interesting to see if a deal gets done before the start of training camp practices, or if more work will need to be done on that front in the next couple of weeks.\n\nRegardless, it does seem like Love will reach a long-term agreement with the Packers at some point, and his comments at the football camp indicate that there might be news on that soon.\n\nLove had a very interesting journey in 2023, but in the end he posted an impressive stat line of 4,159 yards with 32 passing touchdowns and 11 interceptions with a 64.2% completion rate, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\nEarly on in the season, Love struggled, and in many games fans questioned if he was the future for the Packers at quarterback. The loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday Night Football is an example of a game that resulted in Love receiving a lot of flack. However, later on in the season he showed out in big spots.\n\nThe first big spot that Love showed up in was against the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving, when the Packers pulled off a road upset which announced to the league that they were in the playoff conversation. The next week, Love played well in a home win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday Night Football.\n\nA loss to the New York Giants the next week which included some bad turnovers from Love caused some to question him again. However, Green Bay eventually got to the playoffs, and Love showed out in a dominant game on the road against the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe Packers are betting on Love to be their quarterback of the future, and a long-term contract seems to be on the horizon.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Gutekunst", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Gutekunst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Love contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sunday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jordan-Loves-intriguing-response-to-contract-question.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742119", "eventUri": "eng-9742119", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Packers have not made progress on extending Love's contract, raising questions & concerns. Both sides express desire to secure a deal, but valuation differences are likely delaying negotiations.\n\nThings are getting interesting in Green Bay.\n\nLast year, Jordan Love emerged as one of the best young QBs in the league in his first campaign as the starting QB for the Green Bay Packers. However, he was drafted back in 2020, so 2024 will be the last year of his rookie deal, and he is set to hit free agency in 2025.\n\nUnfortunately for the Packers -- but maybe not for any QB-needy team in the league hoping to get a shot at Love during the 2025 offseason -- there has been no progress on extension talks.\n\nWhile speaking to the media at a football camp on July 16, Love was asked about the extension, only for a Packers PR rep to interrupt the journalist by repeatedly saying \"no\" and \"sorry\" (via Fox6's Lily Zhao):\n\nThe interaction certainly didn't seem confrontational, as the reporter and Love laughed, and the rep was smiling as he was shutting the question down. However, it certainly speaks to the contentious nature of these contract talks. At the end of the video, a person can be heard saying \"news to come\", a line which Love repeated before he was shepherded away.\n\nBoth sides have said they want to get the deal done by training camp, which starts on July 21 for Packers veterans.\n\nRelated Jordan Love Can Prove He is Green Bay's Next Great QB in 2024\n\nJordan Love had an excellent first year as a starter, but he'll need to continue playing at that level to be the Packers' next great quarterback.\n\nWhat This Means For Love & the Packers Love is likely looking for a contract in the $40-$50 million per year range\n\nIf you're a glass half full kind of gal, you could view that interaction very positively. Love seemed in good spirits, and the fact that he parroted the \"news to come\" line could be seen as an indication that the contract is incoming.\n\nIf you're a glass half empty kind of guy, you could also take that interaction as a dark omen. It's never very encouraging when a rep for the team interrupts a player speaking to the media, as it demonstrates that they don't trust him not to say something negative.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Jordan Love's debut season as a starting QB was one for the books. In 2023, Love had a better completion percentage, more yards, more TDs, fewer INTs, and a higher passer rating than his predecessors in Titletown, Aaron Rodgers and Brett Favre, had in their debut campaigns as starters .\n\nThe truth is probably somewhere in the middle, but that's not any more comforting to Packers fans, because at the end of the day, their franchise QB still has no contract past the 2024 season, which is a perilous place to be as a team.\n\nThere's no question that both sides want to get a deal done, as Love spoke with Bleacher Report recently about his desire to sign a second contract with the team that drafted him:\n\nThat would mean a lot to me. That would be awesome. To be able to sign an extension with the team that drafted you is something that all players dream of. Hopefully, that happens here in the future, but I'm excited for the upcoming season and what's in store for our team and to be able to solidify something long-term here in Green Bay.\n\nHowever, Love also said \"we'll see\" when asked in May if he'd hold out of training camp if there wasn't any extension in place by then. While there were seemingly positive updates about a deal getting done more recently, those have not come to fruition yet, if they ever will.\n\nThe reason for the extended talks most likely lies in the difference in valuation between team and player. The team would argue that they've only seen him do it for one year, so they can't pay him like an elite QB, in case 2023 was a fluke.\n\nLove, for his part, is probably arguing that the league has a dearth of QB talent right now, and while it was one year, Love proved he was one of the best in the game when it comes to individual, as well as team success, winning a playoff game and falling just short of another in the 2023 postseason while throwing the second-most TDs.\n\nLove 2023 QB Ranks\n\nCategory\n\nLove\n\nRank\n\nYards/Game\n\n244.6\n\n10th\n\nCompletion %\n\n64.2\n\n20th\n\nTD\n\n32\n\n2nd\n\nINT %\n\n1.9\n\nT-14th\n\nPasser Rating\n\n96.1\n\n11th\n\nLove showed the potential to be a top five QB in 2023, and he currently has the seventh-shortest odds (+1,400) to win MVP in 2024 at BetMGM. The six guys in front of him are either on rookie deals, or making $43 million a year or more.\n\nThe latest QB contracts have gone to Kirk Cousins (four years, $180 million), Jared Goff (four years, $212 million), and Trevor Lawrence (five years, $275 million). Those are listed in order of overall value and AAV, but also by how recently they were signed. It seems as though each new contract must eclipse the previous one, which is good for Love.\n\nMost would say that, based on last season, Lawrence is probably the worst of the bunch, yet because he signed later, he's getting paid the most. Love has a higher ceiling than that trio, so when he does sign, we can't imagine it will be for anything less than the $45 million Cousins and Patrick Mahomes are making per year.\n\nUnfortunately, that's the going rate for a star QB right now, so the Packers will have to swallow their pride and pay Love what the market says. If they think they can let Love walk and get lucky by drafting a fourth-straight star QB (Favre, Rodgers, Love) in 2025, they've got another thing coming.\n\nSource: Lily Zhao\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated Comparing the debut starting seasons of Jordan Love, Aaron Rodgers, and Brett Favre\n\nFollowing the 2023 Green Bay Packers season, how does Jordan Love stack up to his predecessors?", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-17-jul-2024-05-43-pm-6207.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742119", "eventUri": "eng-9742119", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 865, "textEnd": 872}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 1473, "textEnd": 1480}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The team finished the regular season at 9-8, then knocked off the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round of the NFL Playoffs before falling just short to the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round.\n\nWith expectations raised, the Packers enter the 2024 season as one of the Super Bowl favorites. How will Green Bay navigate this increased pressure? Here are three Packers players who will be under the most pressure in the 2024 NFL season.\n\nJordan Love\n\nJordan Love exceeded all expectations in his first season as a starter. The Utah State product finished the regular season with 4,159 passing yards, 32 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions -- all better than Brett Favre or Aaron Rodgers' debut seasons for Green Bay. Love was especially impressive down the stretch. From Week 11 onward, the Green Bay QB had 18 touchdowns to just one pick while averaging more yards per contest versus Weeks 1-10.\n\nThe 2024 season will be more challenging for the Packers signal-caller. Teams did not know what to expect from Love in 2023, and Packers fans tempered expectations for their new starter. Even the most optimistic predictions did not foresee Love playing like a Pro Bowl quarterback. Now, Love has a target on his back. Opponents view the Packers as a legitimate contender and will prepare for them as such.\n\nThe Green Bay quarterback will also have to deal with the expectations of the hometown fans. After Love played like prime Aaron Rodgers late in the season, Packers supporters will expect that sort of performance over an entire 17-game season and the playoffs.\n\nAJ Dillon\n\nThe Packers signed former Las Vegas Raiders All-Pro running back Josh Jacobs, pairing him with the bruising AJ Dillon. Those are the running backs of the present. Rookie third-round pick MarShawn Lloyd could be the running back of the future. Lloyd is a dangerous playmaker with good size and speed (5-9, 220 lbs, 4.46 40-yard dash) who has drawn comparisons to Jerick McKinnon.\n\nLloyd is a solid change-of-pace option for the Packers, who will receive opportunities on third down. He has the upside to become much more, which should worry AJ Dillon. Since a productive rookie season, Dillon's yards per carry has dropped from 5.1 to 4.3 to 4.1 to just 3.4 yards per carry last season. Dillon managed just 613 yards and two touchdowns despite starting six contests. He also failed to eclipse 80 yards on the ground in any contest and averaged 55.5 yards per game in his six starts.\n\nThe team re-signed Dillon on a one-year deal, but the 26-year-old carries a cap hit of just $1.29 million in 2024 -- lower than the last two years of his rookie deal. While organizational expectations will be lower, increasing frustration from Packers fans will weigh on the powerful back. For all of his size and strength, Dillon has played more like Eddie Lacey than Derrick Henry, as his lack of explosiveness limits his ability to break through tackles.\n\nQuay Walker\n\nWhile 239 combined tackles in two NFL seasons is an impressive total, the counting stats do not tell the whole story for Quay Walker. The Georgia linebacker is a freak athlete but does not offer much when diagnosing plays and often lacks the positioning sense to make the most of his athletic gifts. Given his speed and strength, Walker should be making far more plays than he does, leaving you wanting more.\n\nWalker had a Pro Football Focus Player Grade of 52.0 in 2022 (Below Average) and improved slightly to 60.0 in 2023 -- barely enough to raise him into the Average category. This improvement is promising, but it is still not where Walker needs to perform. A new defensive coordinator in Green Bay gives the linebacker a chance for a fresh start. Quay Walker will not be in good standing with Packers fans if he does not make a sizeable jump again in season three.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_hanley@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Liam Hanley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Doink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double Doink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_State_Aggies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah State Aggies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Badgers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Badgers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerick_McKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerick McKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quay_Walker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quay Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7616161649.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742119", "eventUri": "eng-9742119", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Green Bay Packers fans and fans across the country. Sign up here to participate in the weekly emailed surveys.\n\nLast week, we asked you if you thought the Green Bay Packers would have quarterback Jordan Love under contract by the start of training camp. This deadline first appeared around a month ago, when Love told the press that his deal would likely be done around that time following a spring practice.\n\nTraining camp is right around the corner, as rookies already reported to Green Bay on Wednesday. Veterans are expected to show up on July 21st, one day before training camp officially kicks off with a practice on the same date as the Packers' annual shareholders meeting. I'm sure there's nothing more the green and gold faithful would like to hear than that their franchise quarterback is locked up for the foreseeable future.\n\nNearly two-thirds, 64 percent, of fans who responded to our poll last week stated that they believe that Love will have a deal done going into camp. The clock is ticking on that date, though.\n\nAt the moment, some rumors are swirling around that the two sides have come to an agreement. Kyle Cousineau, fondly nicknamed \"the mayor\" by some Packers fans, tweeted, \"Birdies are chirping....\" on Thursday morning. Shortly after, a Twitter/X user who goes by prettyrickey213 replied to a previous tweet about the upcoming Love extension with handshake and cheese emojis. For those who aren't chronically online enough to know the lore of Pretty Rickey, he's a Twitter user -- claiming to be getting into the scoops world for the love of the game -- who has hit on a laundry list of transactions since the start of the offseason.\n\nAs far as the compensation goes, assume a Love extension is going to cost north of $53 million per year. That's the mark that Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff hit this offseason, just under the league leader Joe Burrow ($55 million per year). Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence was also able to match Burrow's $55 million per season number, but he fell short of Burrow's $146.5 million in guarantees.\n\nThe big question is just how Love's deal will be structured, as the Packers do not like giving out guaranteed salary beyond the first deal of a contract. With a guaranteed money figure in the range of $140 million to $150 million, though, it's unlikely that Green Bay will just give Love all that in the form of a signing bonus -- which would be stretched over five years on the salary cap. Something simply has to give there.\n\nBy the time practice rolls around on Monday, hopefully, we'll have some answers on the topic.", "source": {"uri": "acmepackingcompany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Acme Packing Company"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justis_mosqueda@acmepackingcompany.com", "name": "Justis Mosqueda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bRJ5I0-y-OsvDCHlybhrbdZZJQ=/0x340:5714x3197/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25536818/1951441553.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742119", "eventUri": "eng-9742119", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 665, "textEnd": 674}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It may even have already happened by the time you read this article. I don't know your life.\n\nSports Illustrated's Bill Huber reported that Love will attend training camp regardless of the deal's status. However, the deal's status may determine what he actually does at camp. Still, based on Love's smile when asked about a forthcoming deal, it seems like a matter of when rather than if.\n\nLove had to fill big cleats last season, and he didn't disappoint. He proved the lights weren't too bright for him. The first-year starter had a rocky start but eventually led the league's youngest offense to a playoff berth and an upset Wild Card victory.\n\nFor the glass-half-full crowd, Love's debut season showed the Packers may have done it again. That would mean his future deal is the start of his long-term reign as Green Bay's starting quarterback.\n\nI'm optimistic about Love's future. He grew week to week, minimizing his mistakes, gaining confidence as a passer and a team leader, and learning how to maximize Matt LaFleur's offense. But let's look at the other side of things.\n\nWhether through regression, an inability to counter what defenses throw at him based on a full year of data, or the curse of an evil wizard or fey creature (these things tend to happen), it's undoubtedly possible Love plays below his new contract and ends up a one-year wonder. What's the worst-case scenario for a long-term contracted Love?\n\nLove is in a unique position for a starting quarterback because of how rare the patience is to cultivate that type of development. Chances are, if you're drafting a quarterback in the first round, it's because your team is bad and needs a quarterback. Therefore, that quarterback will start sooner rather than later. By the time that rookie contract is over, you have a good amount of data on whether to offer an extension or a wave of goodbyes.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens are patient franchises that gave their rookie quarterback some time on the bench. Still, they transitioned to Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson fairly early.\n\nIt's uncommon in today's league for a quarterback to earn a megadeal based on just one season. However, for Love, it's more based on the final eight games of the 2023 season.\n\nThe league has its fair share of one-year wonders, like Tim Tebow, Mike Glennon, Case Keenum, and Nick Foles. While those years elevated some quarterbacks to long careers as backup options, none really compare to the timing of a Love deal.\n\nDaniel Jones is the closest thing to a recent example. The New York Giants quarterback looked like a bust until his 2022 season when new head coach Brian Daboll unlocked some of Jones' latent strengths and led the team to a surprising playoff berth.\n\nTeams want to base contracts on what a player can do rather than just what they've done. However, Jones's one solid season led him to a four-year, $160 million extension. However, his contract aged poorly when Jones regressed in 2023 and missed a significant portion of the season with a torn ACL.\n\nThat left the Giants struggling to build a competitive roster with an expensive quarterback who isn't leading them to victory. As revealed on Hard Knocks, Giants general manager Joe Schoen explained how Jones' deal led to the departure of key free agents like Saquon Barkley and Xavier McKinney (thanks for the latter, btw).\n\n\"You're paying the guy $40 million,\" Schoen said. \"It's not to hand the ball off to a $12 million back.\"\n\nThe Packers backloaded Aaron Rodgers' final contract, creating a difficult cap situation, but it should improve from here. Still, even with a rising cap, Love's deal will take up most of the money the league allows them to spend. It will be hard to build a competitive team if he's mediocre. Worse, the team must spend resources to find a better option.\n\nThe Jones situation shows how difficult it is to create a viable team with a mediocre-to-below-average quarterback demanding such financial space.\n\nWhile the Giants highlight poor roster building, it's extremely difficult to see Love taking a similar path to Jones. Even in Jones' breakout year, he only threw for 15 passing touchdowns. However, he made headlines as a runner, with seven rushing TDs.\n\nLove has already shown more as a passer and did it with a group of unproven offensive weapons.\n\nStill, Love regressed after his dominant 2018 college season, with one of the worst turnover rates in 2019. Love has struggled with the deep ball and showed some gunslinger tenancies, ending Green Bay's season with a bad interception in the Divisional Round.\n\nHowever, learning under Aaron Rodgers, embracing Matt LaFleur's offense, and studying under Tom Clements, a true QB guru, should minimize Love's chances of becoming a bust. It would be difficult to expect him to put up the same stats he did in the final eight games of the season, where he was nigh-perfect. Still, there's a better-than-good chance Love remains a high-quality starter capable of leading the Packers to a Super Bowl for the next decade-plus.\n\nBut the future isn't a given. The league is filled with cautionary tales, especially at the quarterback position, and rival NFC North fans hope Love becomes one of them.", "source": {"uri": "zonecoverage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zone Coverage"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_hendershott@zonecoverage.com", "name": "Matt Hendershott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Daboll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Daboll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Tebow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Foles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Foles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Keenum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Case Keenum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(2001_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (2001 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saquon_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saquon Barkley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/zonecoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/USATSI_22139633_168390100_lowres.jpg?fit=1375%2C988&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742119", "eventUri": "eng-9742119", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Trump, who accepted the Republican Party's nomination for president, expressed his confidence in the Packers' upcoming season while addressing the crowd in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He enthusiastically stated, \"And Green Bay is gonna have a good team this year, right? They're gonna have a good team.\"\n\nThe crowd, adorned with cheeseheads, showed their support as Trump praised the Packers. This prediction followed earlier comments from Republican Michigan Rep. John James, who received backlash from the crowd when he boasted about his team, the Detroit Lions. The Lions had a successful season last year, winning the NFC North title for the first time in three decades and advancing in the playoffs.\n\nIn contrast, the Green Bay Packers, led by quarterback Jordan Love, finished with a 9-8 record last season. They secured a spot in the NFC Wild Card playoff round and defeated the Dallas Cowboys before falling to the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round. Despite the loss, Trump remains optimistic about the Packers' potential in the upcoming season.\n\nWhile Trump's prediction may have sparked excitement among Packers fans, it is essential to consider the team's performance in a competitive league. The NFL is known for its unpredictability, with teams facing challenges and surprises throughout the season. The Packers will need to maintain their momentum and overcome obstacles to secure a spot in the Super Bowl.\n\nAs fans eagerly anticipate the start of the NFL season, the Packers will be under scrutiny to deliver results on the field. With talented players like Jordan Love leading the team, there is potential for success. However, the NFL landscape is constantly evolving, and teams must adapt to stay competitive.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's prediction for the Green Bay Packers adds an element of excitement to the upcoming NFL season. While fans may be hopeful for a Super Bowl victory, the team will need to demonstrate consistency and determination to achieve their goals.

It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great.\n\nWas really excited to see there will be a Packers Everywhere Pep Rally in LA. These are great events and contribute greatly to the close community that all Packers fans have with each other. Look forward to meeting you and Wes (again). As for the game, at least we know 88 won't be running the kickoff out of the end zone.\n\nThe Packers Everywhere crew is going all-out this year with six (!) pep rallies, which is the most ever. I don't know if Wes and I will attend every single one (we may trade off here and there), but I have no doubt GBP fans will bring it at every stop.\n\nRoss from Summerville, SC\n\nGents, any of the UDFAs stand out in minicamp that you are anxious to see in camp?\n\nI have to confess I didn't observe the undrafted rookie class much in the spring. I am intrigued, though, by Wisconsin long snapper Peter Bowden trying to beat out veteran Matt Orzech, and whether the latest kicker entry, James Turner, can make a run at the job.\n\nDoug from River Falls, WI\n\nGents, what is the status of Tom Clements' contract? Is it open-ended and he can coach as long as he wants? His impact on the success of our QBs has obviously been tremendous. It would be great if we could retain him for a couple more years before we turn over the reins to Connor Lewis and/or Sean Mannion. GPG!\n\nI don't know his specific contract status, but LaFleur has indicated Clements is year-to-year based on his desire to continue coaching. When I talked to him for a Yearbook feature this spring, he didn't give any hints about his future. For now, he still enjoys coaching and working for a team in the hunt.\n\nDan from Richmond, VA\n\nWe've all seen plays stopped before the snap when an O-lineman barely twitches a muscle and the ref throws the flag for a false start. So how is it that other times, we see O-linemen (not just the center) coming completely out of their stance before the snap, pointing to the defense, and no penalty is assessed? It amazes me we don't see more D-linemen jumping offsides with all the bobbin' and weavin' and pointin' going on right in front of them.\n\nIf the O-lineman's movement doesn't simulate a snap, it's legal.\n\nJulian from Gastonia, NC\n\nIf Mike turns out to be correct that Rasheed Walker will be the LT for the Packers in 2024, then I would see the only question being if Jordan Morgan will also start. I would think we will have the same five starters from last year or just one new starter in Morgan. Thoughts?\n\nThat's how I see it as well, though to be accurate, Sean Rhyan has never actually started an NFL game, so the Packers technically have four returning starters. Rhyan's time at right guard last year came in a rotation with Jon Runyan, who was the regular starter.\n\nCarl from Onalaska, WI\n\nIf Rasheed Walker can continue to start and do well at left tackle, what an incredible seventh-round gem at a premium position.\n\nMike, can Carrington Valentine do enough this year to make your list of \"all-time\" best seventh-round picks of the Packers? What will you be looking to see from Valentine this year? Starter? Nickel? Third boundary corner? Special-teams regular? Maybe some of all of the above?\n\nI probably could've included Valentine on my seventh-round list but I want to see his Year 2 progress first. He very well could beat out Eric Stokes for a starting spot, and if he doesn't, I see him as the third boundary corner and a special-teamer at the least. His remade body was impossible to miss in the spring. His story is far from written.\n\nMike from Ames, IA\n\nI remember a lot of people, maybe even Packers brass, mentioning that we were very high on Aiyuk when he got picked before Jordan Love in the 2020 draft. Both great talents and hopefully longtime stars in this league, but is it fair to look at their current negotiations and feel very lucky things fell the way they did for the Packers?\n\nThe fortunate part is the Packers got their next franchise quarterback. That's it, that's all. I look at their contract situations without judgment or comparison of any kind. Successfully finding the next guy is all that matters as far as the 2020 draft is concerned for Green Bay.\n\nJohn from Stevens Point, WI\n\nIt was a nice profit year for the Packers. Revenue sharing made the difference, thank goodness. What do the Packers do with the profit? Reinvest in facilities? Devote it to player salaries in an attempt to keep the team competitive? Bump in pay for the hardworking Insider Inbox staff?\n\nThe Packers have invested a ton of money in Lambeau Field over the last 20 years, and most recently that includes the new football space (offices, meeting rooms, indoor walk-through facility, etc.), video boards and concourse renovations. Construction on new office space for the rest of us is ongoing. The team also made substantial donations this past year to its foundation and corporate reserve fund. The latter will become even more important as a strategic financial asset if the league approves private equity investments for clubs, because the Packers can't participate in any private equity offerings due to the corporation's structure.\n\nBrian from Urbana, IL\n\nTo piggyback off the piggyback via Mark from Carlsville: I worked for an HC who GA'd for Woody Hayes. He made us do film analysis by hand (drawing every play). He made us get numbers of players on each play, including lineman. It was a major pain. So, when they hired a new HC, I told him about it, and he decided to make the coloring on our numbers for away jerseys extremely light, because against the white, it's very difficult to see on film. Just to mess with our opponents.\n\nI have to admit, from my own film study, the fonts used for some jersey numbers these days make them awfully hard to decipher.\n\nBart from Wausau, WI\n\nI love how many receivers the Packers have vs. one star wideout, but watching Netflix's \"Receiver\" made it clear that those ambitious stars want big numbers, both in stats and eventual contracts. How will Green Bay keep all these talented young players motivated to be a team, rather than striving for individual glory?\n\nThat mostly falls on the players themselves and the mindset they bring to their jobs and the team. From the coaching side, players must earn their playing time and opportunities. It has to be merit-based. Then the players must cash in on those opportunities knowing others are waiting for their chance. The players are in every meeting and at every practice and game. They know who's earning what and why the opportunities are doled out in a given way.\n\nRich from Grand Rapids, MI\n\nThe \"Receiver\" series on Netflix shares a great deal of behind-the-scenes materials on injuries, personalities and the like. But the parts detailing Adams' frustrations with the Raiders are remarkable. Some observers are now suggesting that players (esp. WR) should consider circumstances more than money in FA. Do you think the series is eye-opening for players, too, or do you think they already know about ALL of that ... but value money over situation anyway? What would you suggest they value?\n\nI doubt there's much of anything eye-opening for players. What they value most is an individual choice. Usually money takes priority, not just because it's money, but because so much about a player's circumstance is beyond his control anyway. Players are wary of sacrificing for a certain \"situation\" when that situation could change next week, month or year as it relates to team success, coaching, teammates, injuries, and everything else.\n\nClem from La Crosse, WI\n\nHow is it even possible for Josh Jacobs to catch nearly 200 NFL passes and not score a single TD? That stat has to be a record of some kind. It has to be on his mind going into 2024. Imagine that celebration when he scores his first receiving TD.\n\nRunning back Gerald Riggs (Atlanta 1982-88, Washington 1988-91) holds the record for most receptions without a receiving TD with 201. Jacobs is at 197.\n\nJim from Westland, MI\n\nJohn Madden suggested to watch the line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped and after ... on TV. Run or pass the camera will follow the ball so nothing is missed, but the telltale work begins there, and like pre-snap motion, the rest is eye candy.\n\nOn running plays, watching the LOS in general (not any specific players) and seeing which way it moves, also helps determine how much confidence a play-caller has or doesn't have in his ground game.\n\nJerry from Des Moines, IA\n\nNot to belabor the \"identifying the Mike\" questions, but what do defenses do to disguise the Mike or disrupt the blocking scheme when they know the offense is trying to point him out?\n\nThey're not worried about disguising the Mike. That's immaterial to the defense. They're just trying to keep the offense guessing as to who's rushing or dropping.\n\nGeorge from Edinburg, VA\n\nMike, did the NASCAR package we used to run, I believe under Capers, make identifying the Mike linebacker confusing for offenses?\n\nNot really. They just identified a starting point in the middle and worked the protection call out from there. That package put a ton of speed on the field up front, forcing the offense to prepare for everyone to rush, in a hurry, when at times not everyone did.\n\nDan from Maquoketa, IA\n\nWith the switch to the 4-3 defense and the outside linebackers becoming defensive ends, will their experience in pass coverage make zone blitzes more effective? Do you expect to see Hafley implement this?\n\nWouldn't shock me. Aside from overwhelming an offense with pass rushers, which carries monumental risk, nothing challenges a protection unit more than constantly making it adjust. The blitz capabilities of Edgerrin Cooper and Quay Walker from off-ball positions give Hafley a lot of options.\n\nDean from Leavenworth, IN\n\nThere seems to be a high level of excitement in and around the Packers regarding Jeff Hafley and the new defense. The players seem excited about the new changes. I don't remember seeing/hearing that level with the Joe Barry defense. I did to some degree with the Mike Pettine defense when he joined the Packers, but this seems different. What do you see in the locker room compared to the last two DCs and their schemes? How important is it for the players to be all-in?\n\nIt's vital, but I'm not going to suggest players weren't all-in when Pettine or Barry took over. There's definitely more change with Hafley, and change can fuel renewal and rejuvenation. I think that's why the excitement feels different. As I said during the spring, though (many times), it'll still come down to results. The right attitude is a great starting point, but outcomes are the ultimately judge.\n\nCaleb from Knoxville, TN\n\nThere's always a surprise division winner every season. Last year was the Texans with the AFC South. Who is 2024's surprise division winner? I'm going with the Commanders in the NFC East!\n\nThat's bold. I don't have one for you. I'm just hoping there's not a surprise winner in the NFC North.\n\nDwight from Brooklyn, NY\n\nFollowing up on reporters' reactions in the press box, I'd like to do a reverse. Did you ever witness a low-key reaction that really stood out because it was so understated in response to a spectacular play? For instance: AR12 throws a Hail Mary. Completion. Response: \"Just another day in the office for AR12.\"\n\nNot really. Though the moment I'll never forget was the Hail Mary TD to Janis at the end of regulation of the '15 divisional playoff at Arizona. Most of the GBP contingent in the press box had headed downstairs during the fourth quarter. Former social media manager Ryan Hartwig and I were the only ones left in our entire row. Staying professionally restrained, I remember Janis coming down with that ball, looking at Ryan with a smile and just quietly saying, \"Holy cow.\" Only I didn't say cow.\n\nCraig from Sussex, WI\n\nYou're J. Love and you just signed for $250 million, what do you buy first? I would buy a condo/house in Florida and a Heath blizzard.\n\nGood call on the Heath blizzard. Highly underrated. I worked at a Dairy Queen in high school. It's even better with butterscotch mixed in. You wanna know what Peyton Manning said when he was asked, right after being drafted No. 1 overall, what he wanted to do with all the money he was about to get? He said, \"I want to earn it.\" Best answer ever.\n\nBill from Fort Worth, TX\n\nMike, show a little optimism. Paul Skenes'll be a Dodger or Yankee before we know it.\n\nGood day Mike/Wes and fellow IIers. More of a question for Spoff. When going to Am Fam to watch the Crew, where is your preference to sit? I've never been, only been to old County Stadium and usually bleachers. My kids have been there several times. I'm hoping to go on July 27. Thanks. Go Crew and GPG!\n\nFor the combination of value and birds' eye view, I'm often in the first few rows of the terrace box near home plate. Or I'll sit in the loge level down one of the baselines as long as I'm not too many rows back.\n\nGary from Sheboygan, WI\n\nInsiders, went to a Brewer-Cub game this year (Brewers won) asked an attendant where I could get a program, I wanted to score the game. The guy looked at me with a blank stare. They don't make programs anymore?\n\nHaven't for a long time now. I've been taking my own scorecard to games for years.\n\nBrandon from Kronenwetter, WI\n\nThe center/quarterback may call out a different mike before every play, but we Inboxers know where the One

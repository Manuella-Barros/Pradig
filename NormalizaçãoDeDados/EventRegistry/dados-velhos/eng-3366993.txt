He didn't say hi to any of us and said, 'What's the high part? What's the most singing part? Christina's going to take that part,\" Pink recalled (via People). \"I stood up, and I said 'Hi. How are you? So nice of you to introduce yourself. I'm Pink. She will not be taking that part. I think that's what the [explicit] meeting's about.' \"\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, Pink and Aguilera exchanged heated words for years over their collaboration. The \"Try\" star even alleged that the \"Candyman\" singer was difficult to work with.\n\nAlso, Pink felt betrayed when Linda Perry broke ties with her to work with Aguilera. \"I took it really personally when she started working with other artists, particularly artists that I didn't like,\" Pink said (via E! News). \"I don't think imitation is the highest form of flattery. I think it's annoying.\"\n\nIn 2016, Pink and Aguilera reunited in \"The Voice\" where she served as a guest advisor for the \"Dirtty\" singer's team. \"Her and I have had history and it hasn't always been wonderful,\" Pink told Entertainment Tonight about her relationship with Aguilera. \"I think it just took us 15 years and I feel like there was true love and it felt really good.\"\n\nAre you happy that Pink and Aguilera have reconciled? Drop a comment below.\n\nPink denies beef with Christina Aguilera because they have already made amends.

After all these years the feud between Pink and Christina Aguilera is SO over. The 2017 VMA Vanguard Award recipient has revealed that their bad blood is ancient history.\n\nGroup hug! Hating on your fellow musicians is such a bore according to Pink. The 37-year-old hit back at a fan who dissed her 2001''Lady Marmalade\" video alongside Christina Aguilera, 36, saying that Xtina was the only true star of the song. While there was some tension between the women back in the day, their feud is long since over. The 2017 MTV VMAs Vanguard Award recipient responded to a fan's mean tweet who wrote, \"Let's celebrate Pink's Vanguard Award with the only relevant video of her career, starring as Xtina's backup singer,\" and included the iconic video from the sexy hit. The colorfully named singer wasn't having any of that hate directed at her.\n\n\"Want to point out an awful new phenomenon of the last 10 years. We can no longer be happy for each other. I heart Xtina, we've made amends,\" the singer -- real name Alecia Moore -- responded on Aug. 15. She tweeted \"Music brings us all together. The best part of music is -- there's room for everyone to win at the same time. Don't be what's wrong w/da world.\" Preach it!\n\n\"Let's be an example of inclusion and celebration. You don't have to like me at all, I'm ok with that. Just be a decent person,\" she continued, before making it personal. \"And you're f*ckin Rip Van Winkle if you've never seen one of my videos,\" she added for good measure. BRUTAL! While she took a break from the music biz since 2012 with the exception of 2016's tune \"Just Like Fire,\" maybe she just needs time to reconnect with more of today's younger fans. We're just so happy she's finally back in the limelight with her new song and video for \"What About Us?\" See pics of Pink's new video, here!\n\nWe saw in a VH-1 Behind the Music special in 2009 that Pink got super riled up when a record exec wanted to take away her part on \"Lady Marmalade\" and give it to Christina. \"[Label executive] Ron Fair walked in. He didn't say hi to any of us and said, 'What's the high part? What's the most singing part? Christina's going to take that part,\" Pink recalled. \"I stood up, and I said 'Hi. How are you? So nice of you to introduce yourself. I'm Pink. She will not be taking that part. I think that's what the f -- ing meeting's about.'\" The two ladies obviously made up because Xtina had Pink as a guest adviser for Team Christina on The Voice in 2016.\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you looking forward to Pink's performance at the 2017 VMAs?

Is that OK?''\n\nShe went on to add: ''You can't win no matter what you say, anyway. Everyone wakes up offended.''\n\nKaty, 32, and Taylor have been embroiled in a bitter feud since Taylor claimed the 'Bon Appetite' singer pinched three of her backing dancers from her 'Red' tour in 2012, but Katy recently said she's tired of the fighting.\n\nIn 2014, Taylor released single 'Bad Blood' which was believed to be about the drama with Katy, who retaliated with 'Swish Swish' this year, which is also reportedly about their battle.\n\nSpeaking recently about the drama, Katy said: ''That's true, there is a situation. Honestly, it's really like she started it and it's time for her to finish it.\n\n''She wouldn't speak to me. I do the right thing anytime that it feels like a fumble.

Weighing in on the saga, the So What hitmaker said: 'Taylor, is that OK?' as she spoke on the radio\n\n'I am ready to let it go!' the 32-year-old Swish Swish songstress told Thrive Global Podcast's Arianna Huffington before breaking into the 2013 Disney anthem.\n\n'I forgive, I forgive, I forgive her and I'm sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from her.'\n\nPink's declaration that she would side with Taylor comes after the revelation that her own 16-year feud with fellow singer Christina Aguilera is finally over.\n\nThe star - who worked with Christina on the 2001 classic Lady Marmalade - styled an on-trend bomber jacket with the word 'lover' emblazoned across her jacket on Thursday as she revealed she made up with her former frenemy.\n\nResponding to a cheeky fan's claim she was 'Christina's backing singer' with Lady Marmalade being her only 'memorable' music video, Pink claimed the comments wouldn't bother her as she was no longer caught up in the feud.\n\nShe retweeted the post which read: 'Let's celebrate @Pink's Vanguard Award with the only relevant video of her career, starring as Xtina backup singer.'\n\nRevealed: Pink's declaration she would side with Taylor comes after the revelation her own 16-year feud with fellow singer Christina Aguilera is over\n\nYet she added: 'Want to point out an awful new phenomenon of the last 10 years. We can no longer be happy for each other. I [love] Xtina, we've made amends.\n\n'Music brings us all together. The best part of music is- there's room for everyone to win at the same time. Don't be what's wrong w/da world.\n\n'Let's be an example of inclusion and celebration. You don't have to like me at all, I'm ok with that. Just be a decent person.'\n\nShe concluded: 'And you're f**kin rip van winkle if you've never seen one of my videos. sic]'\n\nPink's feud with Christina began when the Lady Marmalade artists - including Mya and Lil Kim - met with label executive Ron Fair.\n\nOnly love! The star styled a on-trend bomber jacket with the word 'lover' emblazoned across her jacket on Thursday as she revealed she made up with her former frenemy\n\nPink recalled: 'Ron Fair walked in. He didn't say hi to any of us and said, 'What's the high part? What's the most singing part? Christina's going to take that part.\n\n'And I stood up, and I said \"Hi. How are you? So nice of you to introduce yourself. I'm Pink. She will not be taking that part. I think that's what the f***ing meeting's about.\"'\n\nPink later accused Christina of 'stealing' her mentor and songwriter, Linda Perry, who co-wrote Pink's 2001 track Family Portrait before penning Christina's Beautiful the following year.\n\nRecalling the incident, Pink said: 'I don't think imitation is the highest form of flattery, I think it's annoying.'\n\nIn another sly dig, the star accused her nemesis of being a bad singer, as she told a crowd during one of her gigs that her vocal problems were making her 'sound like like Christina Aguilera'.\n\nMoving on: Pink's outing came after she revealed that she'd made up with her former frenemy, whilst responding to a cheeky fan's claims that she was 'Christina Aguilera's backing singer'\n\nFeud: The pop star - who worked with Christina on the 2001 classic Lady Marmalade - revealed on Twitter that the pair had put aside their differences since falling out 16 years ago", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

{"id": 223706072, "title": "New Disney Attraction Rights a Racist Wrong and Scratches Our \u2018The Princess and the Frog\u2019 Itch", "text": "Since it opened in 1989, Splash Mountain has been one of Disney\u2019s most popular theme park attractions. The water-themed log ride was based on the controversial 1946 film \u201cSong of the South,\u201d which follows a seven-year-old boy as he befriends a former slave while visiting his grandmother\u2019s plantation. Along with deeply racist undertones, it features the annoyingly catchy tune, \u201cZip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.\u201d For years, Black Disney fans have been asking the company to change the attraction so it\u2019s based on a less problematic property. In 2020, in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death, and the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests, Disney finally announced that it would be re-theming Splash Mountain. The story would now center around the movie, \u201cThe Princess and the Frog.\u201d Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure follows the company\u2019s first Black Disney Princess in her new life as a businesswoman. As Disney has released sequels to many of its other animated classics, we\u2019ve not-so-patiently waited for a follow-up to \u201cThe Princess and the Frog.\u201d Since it seems like it may be a while before we get a sequel or live-action remake, it looks like the attraction will have to do for now. With Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure is ready to start splashing guests at Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort June 28, we\u2019re exploring what fans can expect from Tiana\u2019s next chapter and whether the attraction is \u201cThe Princess and the Frog\u201d sequel we deserve. Tiana\u2019s Foods There\u2019s no mountain in New Orleans that resemble \u201cSplash Mountain\u2019s\u201d signature peak. It has been converted into a salt dome that\u2019s part of an old salt mine that Tiana bought and turned into the food co-op, Tiana\u2019s Foods. The story of the ride involves Tiana planning a big Mardi Gras celebration with her friends and neighbors. She needs a special ingredient to finish the menu, so riders travel with her through the bayou to get what she needs for the party. Star-Studded Voices The film\u2019s voice cast, including Anika Noni Rose as Tiana, Bruno Campos as Prince Naveen, Michael Leon Wooley as Louis and Jenifer Lewis as Mama Odie, all return to reprise their roles. It\u2019s not unheard of for actors to portray their film roles in theme park attractions, but for it to be a direct continuation of the movie makes it feel like the ride is canon in Tiana\u2019s world. The Music If we\u2019re talking about \u201cThe Princess and the Frog\u201d and New Orleans, we have to talk about the music. Grammy winning New Orleans natives PJ Morton and Terence Blanchard are scoring the music for the attraction. At a press event in New Orleans in May 2023, Morton told The Root, \u201cBeing able to create original music for Disney...a full circle moment.\u201d Tiana\u2019s New Look Obviously, she can\u2019t go on an adventure through bayou in a huge princess ball gown, so Tiana has a new outfit for the attraction. Our princess rocks knickers, a jacket and awesome boots they should sell in the shop at the exit. It\u2019s actually really cool to see one of the princesses get a second look, as no woman is wearing an impractical ball gown 24/7. New Characters As guests take their trip through the Bayou, they\u2019ll meet plenty of new critters destined to become fan favorites. Among the 17 new characters the ride will introduce, we\u2019ll also see a new version of a character we briefly met in the film. Naveen\u2019s younger brother, Ralphie, is seen playing the drums \u2014 his set based on a classic one at the New Orleans Jazz Museum. For the Culture The reason \u201cThe Princess and the Frog\u201d is one of Disney\u2019s most influential animated films is because Tiana, Mama Odie, Louis and Doctor Facilier are such fresh representations of Black culture. It\u2019s an animated celebration of Black culture for young viewers. Plus, our princess isn\u2019t sitting around waiting to be rescued...she works hard to make her own dreams come true. It stands out for its Black Excellence, something Imagineers seemed to be replicating through the years of research they\u2019ve done for the attraction. Authentic Art New Orleans artist Sharika Mahdi of the YAYA Arts Center, created pieces for the attraction and its accompanying merchandise shop, Eudora\u2019s Chic Boutique. The art she created not only celebrates the fierce independence of Tiana\u2019s personality, they\u2019re also distinctly and unapologetically Black. You may be in a Disney theme park, but this attraction is designed to highlight and showcase the Black culture of New Orleans. Tiana\u2019s Palace With a new attraction coming just short walk away, it made perfect sense for Disneyland Park\u2019s New Orleans Square restaurant French Market to be reinvented as Tiana\u2019s Palace. The menu includes Tiana\u2019s famous gumbo, shrimp and grits, red beans and rice, buttermilk cornbread and of course, beignets. Since Tiana was inspired by the legendary Leah Chase and her family\u2019s historic restaurant, Dooky Chase, the Disneyland chefs bet not mess the baked mac and cheese. Eudora\u2019s Chic Boutique, Ray\u2019s Berets If you\u2019re familiar with Disney parks, you know their attractions exit visitors into a shop whenever possible. Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure at Disneyland Park will be surrounded by shops. Critter Country, which has always felt a little weird for Black guests, will now feature three new shops with \u201cThe Princess and the Frog\u201d themes. Eudora\u2019s Chic Boutique is the main shop associated with the ride and has all the souvenirs you find at most Disney shops, but with a New Orleans and Tiana flair. Ray\u2019s Berets is where you\u2019ll go for all your hats and ears, while Louis\u2019 Critter Club is where items featuring the critters of the bayou will be showcased. Here\u2019s the hard truth: It can be difficult at times to find Tiana merchandise in Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Knowing that there\u2019s three shops that will not only center our princess but also have souvenirs with the other Black characters is really exciting. Disneyland Opening Sorry, west coast Disney fans: no official date has been announced for the ride\u2019s Disneyland Park debut, but it will reportedly open in late 2024. The Logistics For longtime Splash Mountain fans, there\u2019s nothing to worry about: the giant drop will still be there at the end. Other than that, the company is keeping the actual details of the ride close to the vest until guests start experiencing it. If we have to make a few guesses, we\u2019d say it probably has a similar format to Splash Mountain. It\u2019s been announced that Bayou Adventure will be nine minutes long, which we\u2019re guessing includes any pre-ride shows that take place in the queue. As far as getting on the ride when it opens, once again we\u2019re guessing, but we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a virtual queue implemented to cut down on crowd traffic. For other attractions, you use the app to get in line and a notification tells you when to head to the actual ride. You might still be waiting four hours \u2014 you\u2019re just not physically in line that whole time. Splash Mountain Easter Eggs At a press event in May 2023, we were told that there could possibly be Splash Mountain Easter eggs or little pieces of the original attraction still hidden in the new ride, but Disney Imagineers were keeping those secret so fans can experience for themselves without spoilers.", "summary": "<img class=\"type:primaryImage\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_80,w_636/6ff63edb5de5ffc912be00e767585bdf.jpg\"/><p>Since it opened in 1989, <a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 lcFFec js_link\" href=\"https://www.theroot.com/as-splash-mountain-closes-get-ready-for-princess-tiana-1850026347\">Splash Mountain</a> has been one of Disney\u2019s most popular theme park attractions.

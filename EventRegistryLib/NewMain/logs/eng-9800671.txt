This could set a precedent for recognizing and adopting breakthrough therapies that offer superior clinical benefits,\" Matai told Financial Express.com.\n\nOPPI and its member companies remain committed to collaborating with the government to ensure that Indian patients benefit from the latest advancements in medicine as swiftly as possible, maintaining a balance between safety, efficacy, and expedited access, he said.\n\n\"This development marks a significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to align India's regulatory framework with global standards, ultimately benefiting the healthcare ecosystem and the patients we serve,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushmita_panda@financialexpress.com", "name": "Sushmita Panda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Drugs_Standard_Control_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cell therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rare disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orphan drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/thermometer-g9932653d8_1920_2f25d4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800671", "eventUri": "eng-9800671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

With the waiver of Rule 101, the scope of parallel launches of medicines in India along with the West will be opened up,\" the official explained.\n\nBesides, there will be a considerable reduction in the cost of various advanced medicines.\n\nAlso, there will be a substantial reduction in the public procurement costs of the central and state governments under various schemes like the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ayushman Bharat.\n\nAnother advantage is that the resources which would have gone into approving the Indian clinical trials could now be utilised productively elsewhere, the official said.\n\nThe costs of conducting local clinical trials will be reduced for pharmaceutical firms, therefore passing on these savings to patients. This is especially true for cases of rare diseases where firms have logistical difficulties in finding participants.\n\nThe change will promote further research in these areas as there will be access to patient data in the Indian context much earlier, ultimately promoting indigenous innovation and shift from volume to value, the government's mission for the pharmaceutical industry, the official said.

These categories are orphan drugs for rare diseases, gene and cellular therapy products, new drugs used in pandemic situations, new drugs used for special defence purposes, and new drugs having significant therapeutic advances over the current standard care.\n\nAccording to the order issued by the drug regulatory agency of India, CDSCO, on Wednesday, the central government has permitted the waiver of \"local clinical trials\" for approval of new drugs.\n\n\"In exercise of the powers conferred under Rule 101 of the said rules with the approval of the Central Government, the countries namely; USA, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada and EU are hereby specified for following categories of new drugs...,\" said the order issued on August 7.\n\nIndia previously permitted waivers for local clinical trials. However, in 2012, a parliamentary standing committee expressed concerns in its 59th report about approving certain new drugs in the country without conducting local clinical trials. The committee had raised several red flags regarding how the drug controller general of India was approving new drugs without adequate clinical trials.\n\nOn one hand, pharma companies would celebrate this development, as they have been pushing for it for a long time. On the other hand, public health advocates have called for strict scrutiny before every waiver.\n\n\"The move will benefit both domestic and foreign drug makers in India. Moreover, it will also help Indian patients. For instance: Indian drugmakers can manufacture orphan drugs and make them affordable for patients here,\" said an industry official, requesting anonymity.\n\nAccording to T Prashant Reddy, co-author of The Truth Pill (a book on drug regulation in India and the gaps in the regulatory process), \"The move is good, overall.\"\n\nBut, he added, there may be certain medicines that require local clinical trials due to Indian conditions and genetic factors. \"Therefore, a blanket waiver might not be the best idea -- instead, each proposal should be scrutinised individually and the science behind the waiver should be confirmed by people with expertise in the subject.

There is a need for conducting a local clinical trial to generate efficacy of data locally before they are given market use authorisation in India,\" official sources in the Directorate General of Health Services said.\n\nThe move comes as the government feels there is a delay in launching many life-saving drugs in the country.\n\nDrugs under the following category have been proposed for waiver of clinical trials in India:\n\n\"The most sought-after and latest medications that would help treat diseases like cancer, rare diseases like SMA and DMA autoimmune conditions will become available expeditiously in India,\" as per official sources.\n\n\"The decision will be helpful in reducing the prices of public procurement for state governments and also under schemes such as DGHS and Ayushmaan Bharat,\" they added.\n\nDr Viranchi Shah, National President, Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association (IDMA), said, \"It is a welcome move. It enables approval of new drugs based on results of clinical studies done in certain developed countries, subject to certain due diligence. It will help early approval and launch of such innovative medicines in India.\"\n\nFor example, a drug for breast cancer type 3 which is not available in India could now be available after swift approval of the MUA (market use authorisation).\n\nOfficial sources also said that final phase four trials for these drugs could be mandatory in certain cases.\n\nA surge in demand among affluent Indians for weight-loss medications has led to a concerning trend: drugs like Ozempic from Denmark's Novo Nordisk and Mounjaro from America's Eli Lilly are illicitly entering Indian pharmacies, sidestepping regulatory checks.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ozempic for diabetes treatment in 2017, with a higher-dose variant approved in 2021 under the brand Wegovy for obesity treatment.\n\nHowever, Mounjaro, also approved for diabetes, is often used off-label for weight loss.

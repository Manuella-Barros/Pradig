{"id": 225010632, "title": "Lightning strike destroys couple's home of 40-years after they heard 'horrific bang", "text": "Two devastated pensioners from East Yorkshire have had their home severely damaged after it was struck by lightning. Connie and Rob Turner, both 79, were watching TV in their Holme-on-Spalding-Moor home on Sunday evening when they heard a \"horrific bang.\" A fire ignited in the roof of the property following the lightning strike, with disabled Rob needing to be rescued by neighbours. Fire crews managed to extinguish the blaze, but not before the elderly couple lost more than four decades' worth of possessions, reports Hull Live. The scene was described as resembling a disaster movie by Connie's daughter, Caroline Moore, 54, who said: \"It was just like going onto a film set. \"I jumped out of my car, left the engine running and the door wide open, and just ran to the ambulance. I didn't know at this point what I was going to find.\" She added her parents were devastated, saying: \"They were both in tears. My stepdad is disabled so the neighbours managed to get him out. And my mum, her blood pressure was over 200. It was just devastating to see them like that.\" After being taken to hospital and found to have no physical injuries, the pair have been given temporary accommodation in a flat at a nearby farm. However, Caroline said the traumatic incident has left them 'mentally scarred'. Caroline shared: \"One minute they are fine and the next they just break down thinking of the things they have lost. They've got a lifetime of memories in there. \"They have no injuries, they were released the following day, but it's mentally scarring. It's just horrendous.\" For Connie, who has lived in the house since the early 80s, the shock is too real. She lamented: \"I can't believe it. We've lost absolutely everything. We have got nothing.\" Caroline, also hailing from Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, revealed that Connie, a retired hairdresser, and Rob, a former window cleaner, were spending their leisure time together when the lightning disaster occurred. Referring to the fateful moment, Caroline said: \"It was Sunday tea time. I think it struck around 4.30pm. They were sitting in their kitchen area watching the TV. \"There was just an almighty bang. It had become really dark, and then the rain started really heavy. And there were hail stones as well. \"I don't really think they fully understood what it was. It was just a horrific, horrific bang. \"My mum, bless her, ran outside to look at the neighbour's house because she thought it was the one next door. And then she realised it was her own house. \"Smoke was starting to billow down the stairs and through the hallway. I think it struck the roof over the bedroom at the back, that's what we can gather anyway. \"But it's wiped it out. When lightning travels, it needs to find an exit. It just travelled throughout the house.\" Caroline has been in touch with their home insurance company, who have confirmed that the damage to their property will be covered. However, the extent of the necessary repairs remains uncertain. She explained: \"We've no idea what actually will happen. But they've said it's covered, and they've also been covered for alternative accommodation, so once they've found them something suitable they'll be moved there. \"It could definitely be a few hundred thousand pounds.\" In response to the couple's plight, the local community has come together in support. A fundraising page has been established to assist with their immediate expenses, raising close to \u00a36,000 thus far.", "summary": "Connie and Rob Turner, both 79, were watching TV in their home when it was struck by lightning, sparking a huge fire.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/lightning-strike-destroys-couples-home-32916538", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article32916536.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_tearful-pension-1191983.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:32:08", "author": "Laura Cross", "authors": ["Laura Cross"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.523}

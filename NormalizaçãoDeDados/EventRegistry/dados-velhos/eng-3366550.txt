Most were not serious, but in 1.5% of cases, the injuries required medical attention.\n\n'The prevalence of injury among our respondents was high, ' concluded the researchers, 'with 1 in 4 groomers reporting at least 1 injury.\n\nThe study revealed that just 1.4 percent of all the people who let somebody else groom their pubic hair end up injuring themselves require medical treatment. Among the 25.6 percent reporting grooming-related injuries, almost two-thirds had cut themselves. The more frequently and extensively one groomed, the more likely they were to injure themselves. All in all 7,456 adults took part in the survey.\n\nA separate study evaluating how prevalent pubic grooming was among two groups of Midwest college students found that less than one percent of men groom, although the majority preferred their partner to be without pubic hair. According to gender, 67% of men and just over 85% of women admitted to grooming their pubic hair at some point in their lives.\n\nMore women reported a history of injury than men, and most people reported having been injured a couple of times, with 461 people reporting five or more grooming-related injuries. Results showed that 27 percent of women and nearly 24 percent of men cut themselves while shaving and 1.4 percent needed medical attention for their injuries. In females, 51 percent reported being hurt in their mons pubis, or the site above the vulva.\n\nThere may be an unexpected hero in all of this: Waxing, which may prevent repeated injuries in women, the study said, since it removes the whole hair follicle and extends the period of time before pubic hair regrows. Electric razors on the other hand are less likely to cause injury but also less likely to give a close shave.\n\nCuts, burns and infections are reported more than a quarter of the time, according to the online survey of more than 7,500 US adults.\n\nWhether it's shaving, waxing or laser hair removal, pubic grooming has become commonplace - but more than a quarter of those who remove hair have met with mishap in the process, research has revealed. Results were analyzed between mid-2016 and early 2017. Common areas for grooming-related injury for men were the scrotum (378 [67.2%]), penis (196 [34.8%]), and pubis (162 [28.9%]); for women, the pubis (445 [51.3%]), inner thigh (340 [44.9%]), vagina (369 [42.5%]), and perineum (115 [13.2%]). About 74% of participants reported a history of grooming.\n\n\"In a previous study describing injuries sustained while grooming pubic hair, [researchers] used emergency department data to estimate that 12,000 grooming-related injuries occurred from 2002 to 2010 in the United States, with a 5-fold increase in injuries during this 9-year period\", they wrote.\n\nNever let any inexperienced person groom your pubic hair.\n\nHowever, women who waxed had a decreased risk of high-frequency injury.\n\nThe researchers hope not that we'll all stop grooming (current pubic hair trends may prohibit that), but that we'll be more aware of the risk factors, which should lead to safer pube-grooming practices in the future.

The researchers wrote that, given how common the practice is, they wanted to better understand how pubic hair grooming could lead to injury. [51 Facts About Sex]\n\nIn the study, the researchers surveyed nearly 7,600 U.S. adults -- about 4,200 women and about 3,400 men -- ages 18 to 65 about their pubic hair grooming practices.\n\nNearly 5,700 people (about 76 percent) responded that they had groomed their pubic hair at some point in their lives -- 85 percent of the women and 67 percent of the men in the study. About 94 percent of the people who groomed said they did it themselves. Razors and electric razors were the tools most commonly used, followed by scissors, wax and electrolysis and/or laser hair removal.\n\nMore than 1,400 (about 26 percent) of the people in the study said that they had been injured while grooming -- more than 560 men and nearly 870 women. Of those who reported injuries, the most common type of injury was a cut (61 percent of reported injuries), followed by burns (23 percent) and rashes (12 percent).\n\nIn addition, 9 percent of those who reported injuries said that they developed an infection after they injured themselves, the researchers found.\n\nSeventy-nine individuals in the study who were injured while grooming (1.4percent of the groomers) needed medical attention, the study found: Of those, 49 individuals needed antibiotics and 36 individuals (needed to have an abscess drained or a cut stitched up.\n\nIn men, the most common area of injury was the scrotum (67 percent of injured men), followed by the penis (35 percent) and the mons pubis (29 percent), which is the area above the penis. In women, the mons pubis (located above the vulva) was the most common site of injury, reported by 51 percent of injured women, followed by the inner thigh (45 percent), the vagina (43 percent), the area between the vagina and anus (13 percent) and the anus (6 percent). (Because some men and women could have more than one type of injury, those add up to more than 100 percent.) [5 Myths About Women's Bodies]\n\nMen were more likely to injure themselves compared with nongroomers if they considered themselves hairier than others, groomed monthly or every three to six months, or removed all of their pubic hair more than 11 times in their lives. Women were more likely to injure themselves if they groomed weekly or monthly or removed all of their pubic hair more than once, compared with nongroomers, the study found.\n\nIn other words, for both men and women, the frequency of grooming and the amount of hair removed were linked to a person's risk of injury.\n\nThough serious injuries from pubic hair grooming are rare, the findings suggest that guidelines for safe pubic hair removal could be helpful, the researchers wrote. In addition, the study could provide doctors with a way to identify patients who are at higher risk for such an injury, the study said.\n\nThe researchers noted that the study had limitations. For example, people in the study may not have answered the survey questions truthfully because pubic hair grooming is a sensitive subject for some.

But no matter how seasoned you may be at trimming your bush, injuries can still arise.\n\nIn a new study, doctors found that pubic hair grooming injuries may be more common than you think. About 25 percent of those who groom down there experience an injury, according to the research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dermatology.\n\nThe most common injuries reported were cuts, rashes, and burns. While a majority were not serious, about 1.4 percent of the groomers required medical attention for their injuries.\n\n\"In another study, we found that 3 percent of all adults who were seen in the emergency room for urinary injuries had injuries related to pubic hair grooming,\" lead researcher Dr. Benjamin Breyer told CBS.\n\nThis finding prompted Breyer, who's a urologist, to further investigate the injuries.\n\nIn his most recent study, Breyer and his colleagues collected data from nearly 7,500 men and women in the United States, between the ages of 18 and 65. All of the participants answered survey questions about their pubic hair grooming habits, such as how often they groomed, how much hair they removed, the technique used to remove the hair, and who removed their hair. According to the responses, about 76 percent of the participants reported a history of grooming their pubic hair.\n\nAs suspected, the findings showed that those who shaved more frequently were more likely to report injuries.\n\n\"One lesson to take from this is that if you have had significant grooming injuries, or keep getting injured, you should reconsider the areas you groom, how frequently you do it, and the extent to which you do it,\" Breyer told TIME.\n\nAmong the 66.5 percent of men who reported a history of grooming, those who reported injury were most likely to injure their scrotum. Among the 85.3 percent of women who said they removed their pubic hair, those who reported injury reported hurting an array of areas, including their inner thigh and pubis, or pubic mound, and the vagina.\n\nAdditionally, the team found that waxing accounted for fewer injuries than using non-electric razors, electric razors, and scissors; however, the purpose of the study wasn't to find the best hair removal method.\n\n\"Some grooming methods may be safer than others, although more research is necessary,\" the authors write in their published paper.\n\nThe results may be insightful for more than preventing small cuts and other injuries, he told TIME.

Medical attention was required in a small percentage of cases, or 1.4%, the study found. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study conducted a national survey of noninstitutionalized USA adults (aged 18-65 years). Data were collected in January 2014 and analyzed from August 1, 2016, through February 1, 2017.\n\nBut one serious danger of grooming your pubic hair is that an open wound might increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, Breyer added. All in all 7,456 adults took part in the survey.\n\nIn a new survey reported in JAMA Dermatology, researchers found that 76% of adults in the US said they groomed their pubic hair. Common areas for grooming-related injury for men were the scrotum (378 [67.2%]), penis (196 [34.8%]), and pubis (162 [28.9%]); for women, the pubis (445 [51.3%]), inner thigh (340 [44.9%]), vagina (369 [42.5%]), and perineum (115 [13.2%]). Of these most resorted to self when it came to pubic hair removal with just under 4 percent using a professional's help in pubic hair removal.\n\n\"I've had patients who have tried to wax themselves or tweeze themselves, and infections are common\", she said.\n\nGrooming-related injury was reported by 1,430 groomers, a weighted prevalence of 25.6 percent, according to the results. Injuries were more common among women (27 percent) than men (24 percent).\n\nOf those who responded with a yes to have been injured at some point of time during pubic hair removal, two-thirds reported that they had been hurt more than once and one third reported to have sustained such injuries on five or more occasions. Men who removed all hair more than 11 times in their lives were almost twice as likely to injure themselves over their lifetimes as men who didn't remove all their pubic hair.\n\nShould you consider trimming or shaving \"down there\", proceed with care - a new study finds injuries tied to pubic hair grooming are more common than you might think. This is self-explanatory he said, since persons who would remove hair from all the \"nooks and crannies\" were more likely to get injured during the process. \"Infections from grooming injuries are rare\", he says, but grooming more mindfully could save you a visit to the doctor.\n\nBeyer said that razors are the most popular devices people used and also the most injury-causing ones. \"Using electric shavers seems to be not associated with high degrees of injury - probably because you are just less likely to get cut - but you don't get as fine a shave\".", "id": "9704251", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Home", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 973, "date": "2016-08-01", "amb": false, "textEnd": 987}, {"textStart": 997, "date": "2017-02-01", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1013}, {"textStart": 942, "date": "2014-01-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 954}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "id": "302506", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted disease"}, "id": "307207", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}, "id": "315463", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Urology"}, "id": "327677", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cross-sectional study"}, "id": "335116", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hair removal"}, "id": "345967", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tweezers"}, "id": "385647", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweezers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Perineum"}, "id": "459604", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA Dermatology"}, "id": "1132772", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_Dermatology"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 584, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "09:35:00"}

Shaving is by far the most common method.\n\nIt also found that the popular trend of removing all pubic hair, as they do in a Hollywood wax, drastically increases your risk of cutaneous sexually-transmitted infections like HPV - something health experts have been warning for years.\n\nA new report by the American Medical Association identified where and how people tend to injure themselves while grooming their pubic hair. This graphic breaks down the numbers\n\nTHE DANGERS OF PUBIC HAIR GROOMING: HOW IT CAN LEAD TO AN STD\n\nA study from the University of California last year said that adults who trim their pubic hair are 80 percent more likely to get an STD.\n\nThis risk is four times higher for those who get a Brazilian wax, which removes all pubic hair.\n\nThe more times someone grooms their pubic hair, the higher the risk of getting an STD becomes.\n\nHigh frequency groomers - those who groom their pubic hair daily or weekly - are three-and-a-half times more at risk.\n\nStudy author Dr Benjamin Breyer said one reason for this is people who groom themselves might be more likely to participate in 'risky sexual behaviors' than those who do not.\n\nOut of 7,456 adults surveyed, 5,674 said they had groomed their public hair at some point during their lifetime. About 4,800 were married or living with a partner and about 1,750 were single, divorced or separated.\n\nThe most common position for grooming was standing (75 percent), followed by sitting (22 percent), squatting (13 percent), and lying down (12 percent).\n\nWhile most people (77 percent) look directly at the area they are grooming, a fifth (21 percent) used a mirror, while many (17 percent) admitted they didn't look at all.\n\nShaving with a nonelectric razor was easily the most common method, used by 47.5 percent of people.\n\nA quarter of people (27 percent) used an electric razor, many used scissors (18 percent), while just 2.6 percent waxed and just 0.6 percent had laser hair removal.\n\nThe report found 133 groomers were treated for infections after manicuring their genital area.\n\nMeanwhile, 49 received antibiotics for lacerations, and 36 had severe injuries that required surgical intervention.\n\nSurgeries included draining abscesses and stitching up wounds.\n\nFor males, scrotum injuries were most common and penile injuries were also frequent. They rarely reported pubis injuries.\n\nBut the opposite was true for females, who had a high number of injuries to the pubis. Females also sustained injuries to the inner thigh and vagina.\n\nInjuries to the perineum and anus were far less common than others for both males and females.\n\nThe 1.4 percent of injuries that required medical attention were associated with people lying on their back and letting someone else groom them.\n\nNot being able to see the grooming process makes it more dangerous, the study said.\n\nBut there are pros and cons to having a partner groom your pubic hair in this position.\n\n'Having a partner perform one's grooming eliminates a self-tactile sensation, which may predispose to injury. Alternatively, a grooming partner may encourage the injured to seek medical attention,' the study said.\n\nReflecting on the data, Dr Arash Akhavan from The Dermatology and Laser Group in New York told Daily Mail Online it is hardly surprising.\n\nThe report warned of one particularly dangerous technique which seems to be causing the most damage: lying on your back and having others groom your pubic hair - as the Kardashians did in an episode of their show (pictured: Kourtney waxing Khloe)\n\n'In our office we see patients regularly with infections and rashes related to pubic hair grooming,' he said.\n\nHe said using a clean or new razor is the most important safety tip if you are planning to groom yourself at home.\n\n'Using a dirty razor puts you at risk for an infection of the hair follicles called folliculitis, often caused by Staph bacteria,' Dr Akhavan said.\n\nHe warned to see a physician or dermatologist if you have an infection, saying it can get out of hand.\n\nDr Akhavan recommended using a shaving cream specifically for sensitive skin.\n\nHe said to shave in a single direction because shaving in multiple directions can lead to ingrown hairs.\n\nAnd he said to make sure whoever you have wax your pubic hairs is a 'well trained and experienced professional'.\n\nWHAT IS FOLLICULITIS: A COMMON INFECTION CAUSED BY SHAVING Folliculitis occurs when a hair follicle gets inflamed so it can appear on any part of your body that grows hairIt is most common on one's arm, leg, back, buttocks and beard areaIt can be caused by bacteria, fungus or yeastShaving or wearing tight clothes that rub the skin can also cause the infection You can get folliculitis from swimming pools or hot tubs that have not been treated with chlorine properlyHaving a disease that makes it harder for your body to fight infection, such as diabetes or HIV, makes you more likely to get folliculitis\n\n'The skin in this area is very delicate and sensitive and prone to injury from incorrect waxing technique,' Dr Akhavan said.\n\nThe American Medical Association study found that waxing is a more common method for women and it causes them less injuries.\n\nDr Akhavan said choosing laser hair removal to groom pubic hairs prevents injuries and recommended the technique for those who can afford it.\n\nThe study the fact that more younger people are grooming their pubic hair 'could signify a generational trend, indicating that this behavior may continue to become more universal as the population ages'.\n\nThe average age of the survey's participants was 41.9 years old and 68.1 percent were white, 12.6 percent were Hispanic and 12.3 percent were black.\n\nThe respondents were from different geographic areas, were between 18 and 65 and had a wide range of sexual activity patterns, according to to the study.\n\nThe study outlined the differences in the reasons men and women chose to groom their pubic hair, including sexual appeal, partner preference, oral sex and routine care and hygiene.\n\nSexual appeal is particularly a concern among women.\n\n'Reasons for removing all pubic hair in women have been linked to feelings of sexual attractiveness and self-enhancement,' the study said.\n\nIt also said the reasons men choose to remove pubic hair have not been investigated but have been linked to 'increased sexual activity and improved self-perception of appearance'.", "id": "9508903", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "A fourth of the people who groom their pubic hair sustain injuries", "image":

He's an associate professor of urology and epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn this latest report, Breyer and his team found that nearly 67 percent of men and 85 percent of women said they groomed their pubic hair.\n\nAmong those who did so, nearly 26 percent said they had injured themselves in the process. Injuries were more common among women (27 percent) than men (24 percent). Slightly more than 1 percent of the injuries required medical attention, the researchers said.\n\nIn general, the injuries are minor, Breyer said.\n\nBut one serious danger of grooming your pubic hair is that an open wound might increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, Breyer added.\n\nBreyer isn't sure why pubic hair grooming or removal has become popular, but he speculated that it's associated with sex because it has been commonly seen in pornography.\n\nOne recent study in the American Journal of Men's Health found that removing pubic hair is associated with sex in general and oral sex in particular.\n\nAmong some women, getting a \"Brazilian\" treatment, where the pubic hair is removed with wax, has also become popular, Breyer said.\n\nBut removing pubic hair isn't something new. It goes back centuries, when it was looked upon favorably in terms of sex and hygiene, according to a 2014 study in the journal Basic and Clinical Sciences.\n\nIn the latest study, Breyer and his colleagues found that cuts were the most common injury (61 percent) followed by burns (23 percent) and rashes (12 percent).\n\nThe most commonly injured areas for men were the scrotum (67 percent), the penis (35 percent) and the pubis (29 percent).\n\nFor women, the areas most likely to be injured were the pubis (51 percent), inner thigh (45 percent), the vagina (43 percent), and the perineum, which is the area between the anus and vulva (13 percent).\n\nAlthough the skin in the pubic area is as tough as it is in other areas, the folds and ridges in these areas are easy to cut or injure with a razor, scissors, tweezers or waxing. In addition, chemical burns can occur when using hair removal products, Breyer said.\n\nInjuries can also result in infections and ingrown hairs, he said.\n\nAfter taking into account age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, men and women who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more in their lifetimes were most likely to injure themselves, compared with those who did not remove all their pubic hair.\n\nAmong women, waxing decreased the odds of injuries, compared with razor blades.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that because pubic hair grooming is a sensitive topic, some participants may not have been truthful in their response to the survey, the researchers added.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 16 in the journal JAMA Dermatology.\n\nOne New York City dermatologist said she sees plenty of these types of injuries.\n\n\"Removing pubic hair has become more popular among men and women,\" said Dr. Michele Green, of Lenox Hill Hospital. \"They don't want any hair anymore.\n\n\"I've had patients who have tried to wax themselves or tweeze themselves, and infections are common,\" she said.\n\nFor patients who want to remove all their pubic hair, Green recommends laser treatments.\n\nMen may be more reluctant to seek professional help with hair removal, she said. \"You know how the guys are: 'I'll fix my car, I'll do this myself, too,' \" she added.\n\n\"If you really don't like your hair, you should consult a specialist,\" Green said.", "id": "9725828", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title":

For the study the researchers placed questionnaires to participants regarding their approach to pubic hair grooming.\n\nUsed Wax Strip. Image Credit: By Trybex / Shutterstock\n\nThey found that at least three in four individuals removed some or all their pubic hair regularly. Further 26 percent of those quizzed revealed that they have had at least one injury during the process of pubic hair grooming. These could be cuts, rashes or burns write researchers.\n\nThe study was published yesterday in the journal JAMA Dermatology.\n\nThe study was initiated when the researchers looked at the common problems involving the genitalia that presented in the emergency rooms. Benjamin Breyer, a urologist at the University of California, San Francisco and co-author of the study said what surprised them was the frequency with which people turned up with \"injuries relating to grooming\". At least 3 percent of all adults in the emergency presented with a \"grooming injury\" to the genitourinary system he explained. And this was a high incidence that prompted this study for a more in depth look.\n\nFor this study the team of researchers looked at US-based adults aged 18-64 all over the country in an online survey. The survey was carried out in January 2014. Participants were asked to report anonymously about the age they started grooming pubic hair, how hairy they thought themselves to be and the types and frequency of injuries they sustained during their efforts at grooming. All in all 7,456 adults took part in the survey.\n\nResults showed that 5,674 participants reported that they had, at some point, groomed their pubic hair. According to gender, 67% of men and just over 85% of women admitted to grooming their pubic hair at some point in their lives. Of these most resorted to self when it came to pubic hair removal with just under 4 percent using a professional's help in pubic hair removal. Another 9 percent used a partner's help and 0.5 percent of the respondents used a friend's help for pubic hair removal. Nearly three-quarters of participants admitted to using some form of razor to shave off their pubic hair.\n\nMen who thought they were hairier tended to get hurt more often while shaving themselves down there. Results showed that 27 percent of women and almost 24 percent of men cut themselves while shaving and 1.4 percent needed medical attention for their injuries. Among men the commonest sites of injuries were over the scrotum (67. 2 percent) and penis (34.8 percent) while in women the pubis (51.3 percent) was the commonest site of injury followed by inner thigh (44.9%), vagina (42.5%), and perineum (13.2%).\n\nOne of the most common injuries was cuts or lacerations that made up for 61.2 percent of all the grooming related injuries wrote the study authors. A further 23 percent of the reported injuries were due to burns that could be caused by waxing. Rashes caused 12.2 percent of all injuries. Of those who responded with a yes to have been injured at some point of time during pubic hair removal, two-thirds reported that they had been hurt more than once and one third reported to have sustained such injuries on five or more occasions.\n\nBeyer noted that those who went for complete hair removal were those who were more likely to be injured. For example, women who removed all their pubic hair were 11 times or more likelihood of injuries. This is self-explanatory he said, since persons who would remove hair from all the \"nooks and crannies\" were more likely to get injured during the process. He added that most of the injuries reported were minor with only 2.5% of the injuries being severe requiring surgical interventions such as stitches or drainage of abscesses caused due to infections.\n\nBeyer said that razors are the most popular devices people used and also the most injury-causing ones. Electric razors on the other hand are less likely to cause injury but also less likely to give a close shave.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2648859", "id": "9600633", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pubic hair grooming pitfalls: New study", "image": "https://www.news-medical.net/image.axd?picture=2017%2f8%2fshutterstock_421788649.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1444, "date": "2014-01-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1456}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shutterstock"}, "id": "314465", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutterstock"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}, "id": "322191", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"}, {"label": {"eng": "Urology"}, "id": "327677", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hair removal"}, "id": "345967", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser hair removal"}, "id": "348414", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Genitourinary system"}, "id": "385383", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Perineum"}, "id": "459604", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA Dermatology"}, "id": "1132772", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_Dermatology"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "02:51:00"}

Results were analyzed between mid-2016 and early 2017. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Grooming frequency and degree of grooming (ie, removing all pubic hair) are independent risk factors for injury. Of these numbers, 27 percent of women have experienced an injury compared to 26 percent of men. For women, common injury sites are the pubis (51.3 percent), inner thigh (44.9 percent), vagina (42.5 percent), and perineum (13.2 percent). For the study the researchers placed questionnaires to participants regarding their approach to pubic hair grooming. Injuries in the pubic area could make people more vulnerable to infections, including sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAfter taking into account age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, men and women who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more in their lifetimes were most likely to injure themselves, compared with those who did not remove all their pubic hair.\n\n\"The present data may help identify injury-prone groomers and lead to safer grooming practices\", the authors wrote in the study.", "id": "9807725", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pubic hair grooming pitfalls", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "id": "302506", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Safe sex"}, "id": "307201", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted disease"}, "id": "307207", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Razor"}, "id": "332138", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cross-sectional study"}, "id": "335116", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"}, {"label": {"eng": "Groin"}, "id": "339787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hair removal"}, "id": "345967", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser hair removal"}, "id": "348414", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Louse"}, "id": "355687", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blade"}, "id": "368691", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hirsutism"}, "id": "458117", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Perineum"}, "id": "459604", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "18:37:00"}

He's an associate professor of urology and epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn this latest report, Breyer and his team found that nearly 67 percent of men and 85 percent of women said they groomed their pubic hair.\n\nAmong those who did so, nearly 26 percent said they had injured themselves in the process. Injuries were more common among women (27 percent) than men (24 percent). Slightly more than 1 percent of the injuries required medical attention, the researchers said.\n\nIn general, the injuries are minor, Breyer said.\n\nBut one serious danger of grooming your pubic hair is that an open wound might increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, Breyer added.\n\nBreyer isn't sure why pubic hair grooming or removal has become popular, but he speculated that it's associated with sex because it has been commonly seen in pornography.\n\nOne recent study in the American Journal of Men's Health found that removing pubic hair is associated with sex in general and oral sex in particular.\n\nAmong some women, getting a \"Brazilian\" treatment, where the pubic hair is removed with wax, has also become popular, Breyer said.\n\nBut removing pubic hair isn't something new. It goes back centuries, when it was looked upon favorably in terms of sex and hygiene, according to a 2014 study in the journal Basic and Clinical Sciences.\n\nIn the latest study, Breyer and his colleagues found that cuts were the most common injury (61 percent) followed by burns (23 percent) and rashes (12 percent).\n\nThe most commonly injured areas for men were the scrotum (67 percent), the penis (35 percent) and the pubis (29 percent).\n\nFor women, the areas most likely to be injured were the pubis (51 percent), inner thigh (45 percent), the vagina (43 percent), and the perineum, which is the area between the anus and vulva (13 percent).\n\nAlthough the skin in the pubic area is as tough as it is in other areas, the folds and ridges in these areas are easy to cut or injure with a razor, scissors, tweezers or waxing. In addition, chemical burns can occur when using hair removal products, Breyer said.\n\nInjuries can also result in infections and ingrown hairs, he said.\n\nAfter taking into account age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, men and women who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more in their lifetimes were most likely to injure themselves, compared with those who did not remove all their pubic hair.\n\nAmong women, waxing decreased the odds of injuries, compared with razor blades.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that because pubic hair grooming is a sensitive topic, some participants may not have been truthful in their response to the survey, the researchers added.\n\nThe report was published online Wednesday in the journal JAMA Dermatology.\n\nOne New York City dermatologist said she sees plenty of these types of injuries.\n\n\"Removing pubic hair has become more popular among men and women,\" said Dr. Michele Green, of Lenox Hill Hospital. \"They don't want any hair anymore.\n\n\"I've had patients who have tried to wax themselves or tweeze themselves, and infections are common,\" she said.\n\nFor patients who want to remove all their pubic hair, Green recommends laser treatments.\n\nMen may be more reluctant to seek professional help with hair removal, she said. \"You know how the guys are: 'I'll fix my car, I'll do this myself, too,' \" she added.\n\n\"If you really don't like your hair, you should consult a specialist,\" Green said.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about safe hair removal, visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Among the questions, participants were asked the age at which they began grooming their pubic hair, how hairy they thought they were, and whether they had ever sustained injuries through grooming.\n\nPublished in the journal Jama Dermatology, the results reveal that 5,674 out of 7,456 participants reported that they had, at some point, groomed their pubic hair, with almost 67% of men and just over 85% of women saying they had done so.\n\nWhile most reported removing their own hair, just under 4% said they had it removed by a professional while 9% said they were groomed by a partner and 0.5% said a friend did the job. Shaving was the most common method, with nearly three-quarters of participants using some sort of razor.\n\nBut the study also found that 27% of women and almost 24% of men came a cropper while tidying up their pubic hair, with 1.4% of groomers saying they had had to seek medical attention as a result. Among the trends revealed, men who thought they were hairier were at higher risk of injury.\n\nCuts were the most common injury, accounting for 61% of mishaps, while 23% were down to burns, likely to have been from waxing or the use of hair-removal creams.\n\nWhile the scrotum was the prime site of injury for men, the pubis was most likely to be the location of injuries for women.\n\nBut the blunders were rarely one-offs - two-thirds of those who had sustained injuries reported that they had been hurt more than once, and almost a third said it had happened on five or more occasions over their lifetime.\n\nThe study also revealed that those who removed all of their pubic hairwere more likely to report having been injured. \"You are getting at all the nooks and crannies of your body - you are going to get places you can't see very well and that probably in turn leads to a greater likelihood of getting injured,\" said Beyer.\n\nWhile the authors note that the majority of injuries were minor, 2.5% of those who reported injuries said they were severe and needed surgical intervention, from requiring stitches to the draining of abscesses.\n\nBut, Beyer notes, it is difficult to say which method is the most hazardous. \"Razors were associated most [with injury], but they may be the ones that are by far used the most,\" he said. \"Using electric shavers seems to be not associated with high degrees of injury - probably because you are just less likely to get cut - but you don't get as fine a shave.\"\n\nThe study follows previous research from the team which found that 59% of more than 3,300 women reported grooming their pubic hair for \"hygiene\" reasons, while another study by the team found that both men and women who groom their pubic hair were more likely to have sexually transmitted infections and lice.\n\nHowever it wasn't clear whether the link was a result of such grooming leaving individuals more vulnerable to catching STIs, or whether they removed their pubic hair because they had caught an STI or lice, or whether those who tidy up their nether regions might be more likely to shun safe sex.\n\nWhile Beyer says the new research has its limitations - not least that it was based on self-reported answers that might not have reflected the whole truth - he says people should take care to prevent blunders.\n\n\"If you have had an injury, think about altering your practices,\" he said. \"The things that we know can be protective is doing it just a little less frequently, and also taking off less hair in total, treating fewer areas.\"", "id": "9506724", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Wax on, wax ouch: pubic grooming has a high injury rate, survey reveals", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c664e5ac4396f7daa87c0034024a788d14b577/0_0_5131_3079/master/5131.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=7bca8d314f38735a9a4e2f593212dd14", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1089, "date": "2014-01-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1101}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "id": "302505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}, "id": "302539", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Safe sex"}, "id": "307201", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted disease"}, "id": "307207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}, "id": "309248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}, "id": "312495", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"}, {"label": {"eng": "Urology"}, "id": "327677", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Razor"}, "id": "332138", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Groin"}, "id": "339787", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser hair removal"}, "id": "348414", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Louse"}, "id": "355687", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse"}, {"label": {"eng": "Genitourinary system"}, "id": "385383", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "15:00:00"}

Slightly more than 1 percent of the injuries required medical attention, the researchers said.\n\nIn general, the injuries are minor, Breyer said.\n\nBut one serious danger of grooming your pubic hair is that an open wound might increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, Breyer added.\n\nBreyer isn't sure why pubic hair grooming or removal has become popular, but he speculated that it's associated with sex because it has been commonly seen in pornography.\n\nOne recent study in the American Journal of Men's Health found that removing pubic hair is associated with sex in general and oral sex in particular.\n\nAmong some women, getting a \"Brazilian\" treatment, where the pubic hair is removed with wax, has also become popular, Breyer said.\n\nBut removing pubic hair isn't something new. It goes back centuries, when it was looked upon favorably in terms of sex and hygiene, according to a 2014 study in the journal Basic and Clinical Sciences.\n\nIn the latest study, Breyer and his colleagues found that cuts were the most common injury (61 percent) followed by burns (23 percent) and rashes (12 percent).\n\nThe most commonly injured areas for men were the scrotum (67 percent), the penis (35 percent) and the pubis (29 percent).\n\nFor women, the areas most likely to be injured were the pubis (51 percent), inner thigh (45 percent), the vagina (43 percent), and the perineum, which is the area between the anus and vulva (13 percent).\n\nAlthough the skin in the pubic area is as tough as it is in other areas, the folds and ridges in these areas are easy to cut or injure with a razor, scissors, tweezers or waxing. In addition, chemical burns can occur when using hair removal products, Breyer said.\n\nInjuries can also result in infections and ingrown hairs, he said.\n\nAfter taking into account age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, men and women who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more in their lifetimes were most likely to injure themselves, compared with those who did not remove all their pubic hair.\n\nAmong women, waxing decreased the odds of injuries, compared with razor blades.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that because pubic hair grooming is a sensitive topic, some participants may not have been truthful in their response to the survey, the researchers added.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 16 in the journal JAMA Dermatology.\n\nOne New York City dermatologist said she sees plenty of these types of injuries.\n\n\"Removing pubic hair has become more popular among men and women,\" said Dr. Michele Green, of Lenox Hill Hospital. \"They don't want any hair anymore.\n\n\"I've had patients who have tried to wax themselves or tweeze themselves, and infections are common,\" she said.\n\nFor patients who want to remove all their pubic hair, Green recommends laser treatments.\n\nMen may be more reluctant to seek professional help with hair removal, she said. \"You know how the guys are: 'I'll fix my car, I'll do this myself, too,' \" she added.\n\n\"If you really don't like your hair, you should consult a specialist,\" Green said.", "id": "9764487", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ouch&#33;

About 94 percent of the people who groomed said they did it themselves. Prevalence of Pubic Hair Grooming-Related Injuries and Identification of High-Risk Individuals in the United States, JAMA Dermatology (2017).\n\nIn the study, the researchers surveyed almost 7,600 USA adults - about 4,200 women and about 3,400 men - ages 18 to 65 about their pubic hair grooming practices.\n\nPubic grooming-related injuries appear to be on the rise. Razors and electric razors were the tools most commonly used, followed by scissors, wax and electrolysis and/or laser hair removal.\n\nAbout 26% of men and women who groom their pubic hair have been injured at least once, according to a JAMA Dermatology study published Wednesday. Among the trends revealed, men who thought they were hairier were at higher risk of injury. Women who opted to go Brazilian more than 11 times in their lifetime are about twice as likely to be injured as women who don't.\n\nThe survey wasn't created to determine which grooming method-shaving versus waxing, for example-was safer. \"Waxing was associated with a prevention of high-frequency injuries\".\n\nAmong women, waxing decreased the odds of injuries, compared with razor blades. \"That's a pretty insightful thing for us\". The researchers wrote that, given how common the practice is, they wanted to better understand how pubic hair grooming could lead to injury.\n\nShould you consider trimming or shaving \"down there\", proceed with care - a new study finds injuries tied to pubic hair grooming are more common than you might think.\n\n\"We were, quite frankly, quite surprised how frequently people were presenting with injuries relating to grooming\", said Benjamin Breyer, a urologist at the University of California, San Francisco and co-author of the study. Data were collected in January 2014 and analyzed from August 1, 2016, through February 1, 2017. About 74% of participants reported a history of grooming.\n\nOf the 7570 men and women they have studied, 76% groom regularly and about a quarter report injuring themselves in the process. Grooming-related injury was reported by 1,430 groomers, a weighted prevalence of 25.6 percent, according to the results.\n\nIn the latest study, Breyer and his colleagues found that cuts were the most common injury (61 percent) followed by burns (23 percent) and rashes (12 percent). Common areas for grooming-related injury for men were the scrotum (378 [67.2%]), penis (196 [34.8%]), and pubis (162 [28.9%]); for women, the pubis (445 [51.3%]), inner thigh (340 [44.9%]), vagina (369 [42.5%]), and perineum (115 [13.2%]).\n\nNot surprisingly, the people who reported injuries were also those who said they groomed more frequently and were more likely to groom more extensively, in many cases removing all of their pubic hair.\n\nBut the blunders were rarely one-offs - two-thirds of those who had sustained injuries reported that they had been hurt a couple of times, and nearly a third said it had happened on five or more occasions over their lifetime.\n\nInjuries requiring medical attention occurred more commonly when the person was grooming while on his or her back or when someone else was doing the grooming, the study found.

Fun.\n\nResearchers gathered their pubic injury data by conducting a survey of adults between the ages of 18 to 65 living in the United States, questioning them about their pubic grooming choices as well as the injuries they'd received as a result.\n\nPeople were questioned on injury type, location, and severity, ranging from minor injuries, such as small cuts, to serious injuries, defined as requiring medical attention.\n\nIn total, 5,674 people out of 7,456 reported ever grooming their pubic hair, with women more likely to have groomed (85% of women had faffed around with their hair down there, versus 66.5% of men).\n\nOf those 5,674 people, 1,430 people reported experiencing at least one injury as a result of their grooming habits.\n\nMore women reported a history of injury than men, and most people reported having been injured more than once, with 461 people reporting five or more grooming-related injuries.\n\nThe most common injury was laceration (cuts), followed by burns, and then rashes.\n\n133 injured groomers reported a history of infection from their injury, with 49 requiring antibiotics, and 36 requiring surgical intervention.\n\n*Pause for clutching labia in sympathy*\n\nThe majority of those who were injured had been attempted to entirely remove their pubic hair, and hairier men tended to be more likely to hurt themselves while grooming.\n\n'In men and women, grooming frequency and removing pubic hair were associated with increased risk for injury and repeated high-frequency injuries,' note the researchers.\n\n'Thus, increasing exposure to grooming, in particular the degree of hair removal, is associated with increased risk for injury.'\n\nThat doesn't mean all hair removal is a dangerous game, to be clear. It just means there's an increased risk of hurting yourself if you're waving sharp objects around your genitals (which makes sense).\n\nThe researchers found that some grooming methods may be safer than others - waxing, for example, reduced the number of injuries women reported, although more research is needed before we can say that grooming is the safest option around - and that the position in which you self-groom plays a significant role in how likely you'll give yourself a cut.\n\nThe most common position that groomers used to remove their pubic hair was standing (75% of groomers did it while standing up), followed by sitting, squatting, and lying down.\n\nThe researchers found that lying down is actually likely to increase the severity of injuries, possible because it makes it harder to see exactly what you're doing.\n\nGetting someone else to do your grooming for you can be risky too, as another person won't have the sensation of knowing something is uncomfortable or scissors are too close for comfort.\n\nSitting or standing with a mirror, so you're aware of exactly where you're snipping or shaving, is a much safer bet.\n\n'The prevalence of injury among our respondents was high,' concluded the researchers, 'with 1 in 4 groomers reporting at least 1 injury.\n\n'Although most of the injuries were minor, this high rate of injury emphasizes the need for safer grooming practices.'\n\nThe researchers hope not that we'll all stop grooming (current pubic hair trends may prohibit that), but that we'll be more aware of the risk factors, which should lead to safer pube-grooming practices in the future.\n\nTrim safely, pube-y people. Use a mirror, be gentle, keep the skin moisturised, and go to the doctor's if you mess up and hurt yourself.\n\nMORE: Is it ever okay to ask someone you're having sex with to change their pubic hair?\n\nMORE: Men need to pipe down with their pubic hair opinions\n\nMORE: How do vegans deal with pubic lice?\n\nThe Fix The daily lifestyle email from Metro.co.uk.

They can even land some people in the emergency room, requiring treatment for cuts, rashes and burns.\n\nWhether people choose to shave, wax or use the latest laser hair removal technology, pubic hair grooming has become a common practice globally - both in men and in women.\n\nMany studies and media reports have focused on the trend, showing how it is driven by modern's society's definition of attractiveness and perceptions of what is normal when it comes to genitalia. But despite being a widespread practice, very little research has been done to document the type of injuries it is associated with.\n\nIn a study published in the journal JAMA Dermatology, scientists have tried to characterise the type of injuries sustained and the individuals at a high risk of getting injured. They hoped to develop recommendations for safer grooming practices.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2017, the researchers surveyed 7,570 US adults, both men and women, asking them a range of question about their pubic hair grooming practices. This included how hairy they thought they were, whether they removed their pubic hair, how often they did so, what method they used, and whether they had already sustained an injury from it and had needed medical attention as a result.\n\nThe researchers found that 76.1% of participants reported a history of grooming.\n\nAmong them, the number of injuries was surprisingly high. More than a quarter of the 'groomers' reported a related injury.\n\nCuts were the most common injury sustained, followed by burns and then by rashes - which makes sense considering that razors were the most commonly used instruments. Only 1.4% of participants however required medical attention, indicating that serious injuries are quite rare.\n\nRemoving all the pubic hair was linked with a higher probability of sustaining an injury. Both men and women who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more during their lifespan were found to have an increased risk for grooming injury.\n\nThe results suggest that grooming frequency, as well as how much hair is removed, are risk factors for injury. Waxing appeared to be protective against injuries in women, but more research will be needed to confirm this and to come up with recommendations for safe pubic hair grooming, as the practice does not seem to be receding.\n\n\"Injury-prevention efforts are necessary. Clinicians may use this data to identify patients at high risk for injury. This study may contribute to the development of clinical guidelines or recommendations for safe pubic hair removal,\" the authors conclude.", "id": "9730931", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pubic service announcement: Hair-grooming injuries are more common than you think", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1572241/wax.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}, "id": "322191", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Razor"}, "id": "332138", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser hair removal"}, "id": "348414", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA Dermatology"}, "id": "1132772", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_Dermatology"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "16:17:00"}

Most were not serious, but in 1.5% of cases, the injuries required medical attention.\n\nFor ladies, it's upkeep, for gentlemen, it's \"manscaping\", but it's also potentially unsafe: a quarter of individuals injure themselves while engage in pubic grooming, a study found. He plans to look at the relationship between grooming injuries and sexually transmitted infections to see if injuries might lead to higher rates of transmission.\n\nWhile the authors note that the majority of injuries were minor, 2.5% of those who reported injuries said they were severe and needed surgical intervention, from requiring stitches to the draining of abscesses.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2017, the researchers surveyed 7,570 USA adults, both men and women, asking them a range of question about their pubic hair grooming practices. Men who removed all hair more than 11 times in their lives were almost twice as likely to injure themselves over their lifetimes as men who didn't remove all their pubic hair. Of those who responded with a yes to have been injured at some point of time during pubic hair removal, two-thirds reported that they had been hurt more than once and one third reported to have sustained such injuries on five or more occasions.\n\nBut the study also found that 27% of women and nearly 24% of men came a cropper while tidying up their pubic hair, with 1.4% of groomers saying they had had to seek medical attention as a result. \"This study may contribute to the development of clinical guidelines or recommendations for safe pubic hair removal\", the authors conclude. Results were analyzed between mid-2016 and early 2017.\n\nPubic grooming-related injuries appear to be on the rise.\n\nLaceration occurred in 61.2% of the cohort, and burn was reported in 23% and rashes in 12.2%.\n\nThe most commonly injured areas for men were the scrotum (67 percent), the penis (35 percent) and the pubis (29 percent). Those getting Brazilian wax and remove all their pubic hair were said to be at four times greater risk. After adjustment for age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, men who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more during their lifespan had an increased risk for grooming injury (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.28-3.01; P =.002) and were prone to repeated high-frequency injuries (AOR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.01-7.52; P .001) compared with groomers who did not remove all their pubic hair. About 74% of participants reported a history of grooming.\n\nAmong women, waxing decreased the odds of injuries, compared with razor blades.

He's an associate professor of urology and epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn this latest report, Breyer and his team found that nearly 67 percent of men and 85 percent of women said they groomed their pubic hair.\n\nAmong those who did so, nearly 26 percent said they had injured themselves in the process. Injuries were more common among women (27 percent) than men (24 percent). Slightly more than 1 percent of the injuries required medical attention, the researchers said.\n\nIn general, the injuries are minor, Breyer said.\n\nBut one serious danger of grooming your pubic hair is that an open wound might increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, Breyer added.\n\nBreyer isn't sure why pubic hair grooming or removal has become popular, but he speculated that it's associated with sex because it has been commonly seen in pornography.\n\nOne recent study in the American Journal of Men's Health found that removing pubic hair is associated with sex in general and oral sex in particular.\n\nAmong some women, getting a \"Brazilian\" treatment, where the pubic hair is removed with wax, has also become popular, Breyer said.\n\nBut removing pubic hair isn't something new. It goes back centuries, when it was looked upon favorably in terms of sex and hygiene, according to a 2014 study in the journal Basic and Clinical Sciences.\n\nIn the latest study, Breyer and his colleagues found that cuts were the most common injury (61 percent) followed by burns (23 percent) and rashes (12 percent).\n\nThe most commonly injured areas for men were the scrotum (67 percent), the penis (35 percent) and the pubis (29 percent).\n\nFor women, the areas most likely to be injured were the pubis (51 percent), inner thigh (45 percent), the vagina (43 percent), and the perineum, which is the area between the anus and vulva (13 percent).\n\nAlthough the skin in the pubic area is as tough as it is in other areas, the folds and ridges in these areas are easy to cut or injure with a razor, scissors, tweezers or waxing. In addition, chemical burns can occur when using hair removal products, Breyer said.\n\nInjuries can also result in infections and ingrown hairs, he said.\n\nAfter taking into account age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, men and women who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more in their lifetimes were most likely to injure themselves, compared with those who did not remove all their pubic hair.\n\nAmong women, waxing decreased the odds of injuries, compared with razor blades.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that because pubic hair grooming is a sensitive topic, some participants may not have been truthful in their response to the survey, the researchers added.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 16 in the journal JAMA Dermatology.\n\nOne New York City dermatologist said she sees plenty of these types of injuries.\n\n\"Removing pubic hair has become more popular among men and women,\" said Dr. Michele Green, of Lenox Hill Hospital. \"They don't want any hair anymore.\n\n\"I've had patients who have tried to wax themselves or tweeze themselves, and infections are common,\" she said.\n\nFor patients who want to remove all their pubic hair, Green recommends laser treatments.\n\nMen may be more reluctant to seek professional help with hair removal, she said. \"You know how the guys are: 'I'll fix my car, I'll do this myself, too,' \" she added.\n\n\"If you really don't like your hair, you should consult a specialist,\" Green said.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about safe hair removal, visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSOURCES: Benjamin Breyer, M.D., associate professor, urology and epidemiology and biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco; Michele Green, M.D., dermatologist, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Aug. 16, 2017, JAMA Dermatology, online\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

He's an associate professor of urology and epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn this latest report, Breyer and his team found that nearly 67 percent of men and 85 percent of women said they groomed their pubic hair.\n\nAmong those who did so, nearly 26 percent said they had injured themselves in the process. Injuries were more common among women (27 percent) than men (24 percent). Slightly more than 1 percent of the injuries required medical attention, the researchers said.\n\nIn general, the injuries are minor, Breyer said.\n\nBut one serious danger of grooming your pubic hair is that an open wound might increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, Breyer added.\n\nBreyer isn't sure why pubic hair grooming or removal has become popular, but he speculated that it's associated with sex because it has been commonly seen in pornography.\n\nOne recent study in the American Journal of Men's Health found that removing pubic hair is associated with sex in general and oral sex in particular.\n\nAmong some women, getting a \"Brazilian\" treatment, where the pubic hair is removed with wax, has also become popular, Breyer said.\n\nBut removing pubic hair isn't something new. It goes back centuries, when it was looked upon favorably in terms of sex and hygiene, according to a 2014 study in the journal Basic and Clinical Sciences.\n\nIn the latest study, Breyer and his colleagues found that cuts were the most common injury (61 percent) followed by burns (23 percent) and rashes (12 percent).\n\nContinued\n\nThe most commonly injured areas for men were the scrotum (67 percent), the penis (35 percent) and the pubis (29 percent).\n\nFor women, the areas most likely to be injured were the pubis (51 percent), inner thigh (45 percent), the vagina (43 percent), and the perineum, which is the area between the anus and vulva (13 percent).\n\nAlthough the skin in the pubic area is as tough as it is in other areas, the folds and ridges in these areas are easy to cut or injure with a razor, scissors, tweezers or waxing. In addition, chemical burns can occur when using hair removal products, Breyer said.\n\nInjuries can also result in infections and ingrown hairs, he said.\n\nAfter taking into account age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, men and women who removed all their pubic hair 11 times or more in their lifetimes were most likely to injure themselves, compared with those who did not remove all their pubic hair.\n\nAmong women, waxing decreased the odds of injuries, compared with razor blades.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that because pubic hair grooming is a sensitive topic, some participants may not have been truthful in their response to the survey, the researchers added.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 16 in the journal JAMA Dermatology.\n\nOne New York City dermatologist said she sees plenty of these types of injuries.\n\n\"Removing pubic hair has become more popular among men and women,\" said Dr. Michele Green, of Lenox Hill Hospital. \"They don't want any hair anymore.\n\n\"I've had patients who have tried to wax themselves or tweeze themselves, and infections are common,\" she said.\n\nFor patients who want to remove all their pubic hair, Green recommends laser treatments.\n\nMen may be more reluctant to seek professional help with hair removal, she said. \"You know how the guys are: 'I'll fix my car, I'll do this myself, too,' \" she added.\n\n\"If you really don't like your hair, you should consult a specialist,\" Green said.\n\nWebMD News from HealthDay Sources SOURCES: Benjamin Breyer, M.D., associate professor, urology and epidemiology and biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco;

For women, common injury sites are the pubis (51.3 percent), inner thigh (44.9 percent), vagina (42.5 percent), and perineum (13.2 percent).\n\nResearchers from the University of California San Francisco, University of Texas Dell Medical School and Washington University School of Medicine conducted a survey of 7,570 adults in the United States ages 18-65 in January 2014 to gather information about grooming habits and their risks.\n\nOf that group, 4,198 men and 3,372 women reported a \"history of grooming.\" Some 25.6 percent also reported having received injuries, with women reporting more injuries than men.\n\nIn other words, one in four \"groomers\" reported at least one injury. More than 32 percent of them reported 5 or more injuries.\n\nThe researchers note that serious grooming injuries are rare: Only 2.5 percent of groomers experienced an injury that required surgical treatment, like draining an abscess or closing a wound with stitches. But their study also pointed out that as pubic hair removal has gained popularity, associated injuries have risen, too.\n\n\"In a previous study describing injuries sustained while grooming pubic hair, [researchers] used emergency department data to estimate that 12,000 grooming-related injuries occurred from 2002 to 2010 in the United States, with a 5-fold increase in injuries during this 9-year period,\" they wrote.\n\nThe researchers also took into account factors like type of instrument used, hairiness, age and how long a person has been grooming, writing that at least for women, waxingwas \"protective against high-frequency injuries\" and may be their safest option, though more research is needed to be sure.\n\nInjury isn't the only reason a person might want to shy away from excessive grooming. Previous research found that people who engage in pubic hair removal more than 11 times in a year have a heightened risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections, though the reason isn't clear.\n\nWhatever your pubic hair preferences are, be careful out there, folks.", "id": "9884298", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "These Gruesome-Sounding Injuries Are Rising As More People Groom Their Pubes", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5996ca9d22000009371a69e7.jpeg?ops=2000_1000", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 904, "date": "2014-01-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 916}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "id": "302505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wound"}, "id": "306299", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}, "id": "309497", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}, "id": "312495", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Abscess"}, "id": "318236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}, {"label": {"eng": "American Medical Association"}, "id": "407459", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Perineum"}, "id": "459604", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Washington University School of Medicine"}, "id": "531706", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_School_of_Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA Dermatology"}, "id": "1132772", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_Dermatology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dell Medical School"}, "id": "1318728", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Medical_School"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 812, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders"}], "time": "11:44:00"}

Shaving is by far the most common method.\n\nIt also found that the popular trend of removing all pubic hair, as they do in a Hollywood wax, drastically increases your risk of sexually-transmitted infections like HPV - something health experts have been warning for years.\n\nOut of 7456 adults surveyed, 5674 said they had groomed their pubic hair at some point during their lifetime. About 4800 were married or living with a partner and about 1750 were single, divorced or separated.\n\nThe most common position for grooming was standing (75 per cent), followed by sitting (22 per cent), squatting (13 per cent), and lying down (12 per cent).\n\nWhile most people (77 per cent) look directly at the area they are grooming, a fifth (21 per cent) used a mirror, while many (17 per cent) admitted they didn't look at all.\n\nShaving with a non electric razor was easily the most common method, used by 47.5 per cent of people.\n\nA quarter of people (27 per cent) used an electric razor, many used scissors (18 per cent), while just 2.6 per cent waxed and just 0.6 per cent had laser hair removal.\n\nThe report found 133 groomers were treated for infections after manicuring their genital area.\n\nMeanwhile, 49 received antibiotics for lacerations, and 36 had severe injuries that required surgical intervention.\n\nSurgeries included draining abscesses and stitching up wounds.\n\nFor males, scrotum injuries were most common and penile injuries were also frequent. They rarely reported pubis injuries.\n\nBut the opposite was true for females, who had a high number of injuries to the pubis. Females also sustained injuries to the inner thigh and vagina.\n\nInjuries to the perineum and anus were far less common than others for both males and females.\n\nThe 1.4 per cent of injuries that required medical attention were associated with people lying on their back and letting someone else groom them.\n\nNot being able to see the grooming process makes it more dangerous, the study said.\n\nBut there are pros and cons to having a partner groom your pubic hair in this position.\n\n\"Having a partner perform one's grooming eliminates a self-tactile sensation, which may predispose to injury. Alternatively, a grooming partner may encourage the injured to seek medical attention,\" the study said.\n\nReflecting on the data, Dr Arash Akhavan from the Dermatology and Laser Group in New York told Daily Mail Online it is hardly surprising.\n\n\"In our office we see patients regularly with infections and rashes related to pubic hair grooming,\" he said.\n\nHe said using a clean or new razor is the most important safety tip if you are planning to groom yourself at home.\n\n\"Using a dirty razor puts you at risk for an infection of the hair follicles called folliculitis, often caused by Staph bacteria,\" Akhavan said.\n\nHe warned to see a physician or dermatologist if you have an infection, saying it can get out of hand.\n\nAkhavan recommended using a shaving cream specifically for sensitive skin.\n\nHe said to shave in a single direction because shaving in multiple directions can lead to ingrown hairs.\n\nAnd he said to make sure whoever you have wax your pubic hairs is a \"well trained and experienced professional\".\n\n\"The skin in this area is very delicate and sensitive and prone to injury from incorrect waxing technique,\" Akhavan said.\n\nThe American Medical Association study found that waxing is a more common method for women and it causes them less injuries.\n\nAkhavan said choosing laser hair removal to groom pubic hairs prevents injuries and recommended the technique for those who can afford it.\n\nThe study said the fact that more younger people are grooming their pubic hair \"could signify a generational trend, indicating that this behavior may continue to become more universal as the population ages\".\n\nThe average age of the survey's participants was 41.9 years old and 68.1 per cent were white, 12.6 per cent were Hispanic and 12.3 per cent were black.\n\nThe respondents were from different geographic areas, were between 18 and 65 and had a wide range of sexual activity patterns, according to the study.\n\nThe study outlined the differences in the reasons men and women chose to groom their pubic hair, including sexual appeal, partner preference, oral sex and routine care and hygiene.\n\nSexual appeal is particularly a concern among women.\n\n\"Reasons for removing all pubic hair in women have been linked to feelings of sexual attractiveness and self-enhancement,\" the study said.\n\nIt also said the reasons men choose to remove pubic hair have not been investigated but have been linked to \"increased sexual activity and improved self-perception of appearance\".\n\nDo:\n\n* Shave your pubic hair in one direction, as shaving in different directions can cause you to have an ingrown hair\n\n* See a physician or dermatologist immediately if you think you have an infection\n\nDon't:\n\n* Never let someone who has not had experience waxing pubic hair groom you\n\n* Do not use a razor that is old or dirty, as it increases your risk of infection\n\nA study from the University of California last year said that adults who trim their pubic hair are 80 per cent more likely to get an STD.\n\nThis risk is four times higher for those who get a Brazilian wax, which removes all pubic hair.\n\nThe more times someone grooms their pubic hair, the higher the risk of getting an STD becomes.\n\nHigh frequency groomers - those who groom their pubic hair daily or weekly - are three-and-a-half times more at risk.\n\nStudy author Dr Benjamin Breyer said one reason for this is people who groom themselves might be more likely to participate in 'risky sexual behaviours' than those who do not.\n\n* Folliculitis occurs when a hair follicle gets inflamed so it can appear on any part of your body that grows hair\n\n* It is most common on one's arm, leg, back, buttocks and beard area\n\n* It can be caused by bacteria, fungus or yeast\n\n* Shaving or wearing tight clothes that rub the skin can also cause the infection\n\n* You can get folliculitis from swimming pools or hot tubs that have not been treated with chlorine properly\n\n* Having a disease that makes it harder for your body to fight infection, such as diabetes or HIV, makes you more likely to get folliculitis", "id": "9609614",

The team sent 14,409 surveys to people across the country ages 18 to 65 years old, asking them about their pubic hair grooming habits and injuries they have sustained as a result.\n\nOf the surveys sent, 52.5% or 7,570 people turned in completed questionnaires. Among them, 55.5% were men and 44.5% were women. Over three-fourths of those surveyed said that they groomed their pubic hair, women more so than men.\n\nIt turned out that injuries sustained while grooming were quite common - 25.6% reported experiencing it.\n\nMore women than men had injuries to their privates while grooming. Cuts were the most common kind at 61.2%, followed by burns at 23% and rashes at 12.2%. Of these, 66.5% admitted that they hurt themselves more than once, while 32.2% said they had suffered an injury five or more times. The overwhelming majority did not require medical attention, with only 3.4% needing antibiotics for infections. A small 2.5% needed surgery.\n\nThe more severe injuries happened when the person was lying on his or her back, or when other people were doing the grooming, the study added. \"Heat maps\" showing where the injuries occurred the most in men and women pointed to the scrotum as the most vulnerable part in men, followed by the penis and pubis. In women, the pubis was the most susceptible, followed by the inner thigh, vagina and perineum.\n\nIn addition, men who removed all of their pubic hair were over 11 times more likely to have hurt themselves, while women who removed all of their pubic hair more than once were more likely to get injured. Women who waxed, however, were less likely to suffer repeated injuries.\n\nThe study was published in JAMA Dermatology.\n\nRelated Items: Grooming, Public Health, Sexual Health", "id": "9765943", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Injuries Caused By Pubic Hair Grooming Are Common, Study Says", "image": "https://www.immortal.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/razor_1502993669.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "id": "302505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "id": "302506", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antibacterial"}, "id": "303485", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Perineum"}, "id": "459604", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Washington University School of Medicine"}, "id": "531706", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_School_of_Medicine"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "16:17:00"}

For women, common injury sites are the pubis (51.3 percent), inner thigh (44.9 percent), vagina (42.5 percent), and perineum (13.2 percent).\n\nResearchers from the University of California San Francisco, University of Texas Dell Medical School and Washington University School of Medicine conducted a survey of 7,570 adults in the United States ages 18-65 in January 2014 to gather information about grooming habits and their risks.\n\nOf that group, 4,198 men and 3,372 women reported a \"history of grooming.\" Some 25.6 percent also reported having received injuries, with women reporting more injuries than men.\n\nIn other words, one in four \"groomers\" reported at least one injury. More than 32 percent of them reported 5 or more injuries.\n\nThe researchers note that serious grooming injuries are rare: Only 2.5 percent of groomers experienced an injury that required surgical treatment, like draining an abscess or closing a wound with stitches. But their study also pointed out that as pubic hair removal has gained popularity, associated injuries have risen, too.\n\n\"In a previous study describing injuries sustained while grooming pubic hair, [researchers] used emergency department data to estimate that 12,000 grooming-related injuries occurred from 2002 to 2010 in the United States, with a 5-fold increase in injuries during this 9-year period,\" they wrote.\n\nThe researchers also took into account factors like type of instrument used, hairiness, age and how long a person has been grooming, writing that at least for women, waxing was \"protective against high-frequency injuries\" and may be their safest option, though more research is needed to be sure.\n\nInjury isn't the only reason a person might want to shy away from excessive grooming. Previous research found that people who engage in pubic hair removal more than 11 times in a year have a heightened risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections, though the reason isn't clear.\n\nWhatever your pubic hair preferences are, be careful out there, folks.", "id": "9743747", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Gruesome Injuries Are Rising As More People Groom Their Pubes", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5995cac92700003100d4f830.jpeg?cache=6iut8jszn9&ops=1910_1000", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 667, "date": "2014-01-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 679}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "id": "302505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wound"}, "id": "306299", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}, "id": "309497", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}, "id": "312495", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Abscess"}, "id": "318236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}, {"label": {"eng": "American Medical Association"}, "id": "407459", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Perineum"}, "id": "459604", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Washington University School of Medicine"}, "id": "531706", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_School_of_Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA Dermatology"}, "id": "1132772", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_Dermatology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dell Medical School"}, "id": "1318728", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Medical_School"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 812, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders"}], "time": "17:24:00"}

The more frequently and extensively one groomed, the more likely they were to injure themselves.\n\nThe study, surveying almost 7,600 U.S. adults ages 18 to 65, found that 50 to 87 percent had some form of pubic grooming. A staggering 94 percent revealed that they groomed themselves, and the most commonly used tools were razors, electric razors, scissors, wax, and laser hair removal.\n\nAbout 26 percent disclosed having injuries while grooming, or over 560 men and almost 870 women. Of those who reported injuries, 61 percent experienced a cut, 23 percent had burns, and 12 percent suffered rashes.\n\nNine percent of those with injuries thought they had an infection after the grooming incident. Seventy-nine participants who had an injury needed medical care, with 49 using antibiotics and 36 having a cut fixed or an abscess drained.\n\nThe location of injuries varied between the sexes. In females, 51 percent reported being hurt in their mons pubis, or the site above the vulva. This was followed by the inner thigh, vagina, area located between the vagina and anus, and anus.\n\nIn males, on the other hand, the scrotum was the most common site of injury with 67 percent of injured subjects, followed by the penis and the mons pubis.\n\nFor both men and women, how frequently one groomed and how much hair was removed were both linked to individual injury risk.\n\nBenjamin Beyer, study author and urologist at the University of California, San Francisco, said it could be difficult to say which grooming method is most dangerous to use.\n\n\"Razors were associated most [with injury], but they may be the ones that are by far used the most,\" he said, adding that electric shavers don't offer as fine a shave despite being unlikely to cause high degrees of injury.\n\nThe research is limited by the fact that it used self-reported answers, but the authors emphasized the need to prevent these grooming blunders. This could involve practicing it less frequently and taking off less hair in total.\n\nDoctors, too, could identify patients with a higher risk for such injuries.\n\nThe study followed previous research from the same team that found 59 percent of over 3,300 women reported grooming their pubic hair for hygiene purposes.", "id": "9704241", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "You're Likely Hurting Yourself When Grooming Your Pubic Hair: Study", "image": "http://images.techtimes.com/data/images/full/313091/bikini.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "id": "302506", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scissors"}, "id": "303293", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scissors"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antibacterial"}, "id": "303485", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vulva"}, "id": "309023", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Abscess"}, "id": "318236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Urology"}, "id": "327677", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser hair removal"}, "id": "348414", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anus"}, "id": "351292", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mons pubis"}, "id": "362582", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mons_pubis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "09:35:00"}

The researchers found that removing all pubic hair, and frequent hair removal, were most likely to cause injuries.\n\nPubic hair removal has become more common in recent years. This could be due to the mistaken assumption that grooming is more hygienic (as we discussed in 2016). Some commentators have also cited the influence of pornography, where shaved genitals are the norm.\n\nThe researchers found 66.5% of men and 85.3% of women who responded to their survey had removed or groomed pubic hair at some point in their lives. However, it's not as dangerous as the Mail Online headline suggests - while 25.6% of people reported at least one injury, these were almost all minor and only 1.4% reported injury that required medical attention.\n\nCuts, burns, rashes and infections were the main problems. Waxing seemed to cause fewer injuries than shaving, although researchers say more study is needed before it can be recommended as a safer option.\n\nPrevious research has shown that removal of pubic hair can also make sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HPV more likely.\n\nThe most effective method of reducing your risk of catching an STI is to always used a condom during sex, including oral and anal sex.\n\nThe study was carried out by researchers from the University of California, the University of Texas Dell Medical School and the Washington University School of Medicine, all in the US. It was funded by the Alafi Foundation, the Hellman Foundation and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nIt was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Dermatology.\n\nThe Guardian carried a balanced and accurate report of the study. In contrast, the Mail Online's reporting was muddled, misleading and sensationalised. For example, the website states: \"A quarter of groomers have suffered severe injuries,\" although the injuries were mostly minor.\n\nThe Mail also inaccurately reported that \"more than a third of people surveyed by government health researchers\" said they'd had five or more injuries - although this figure applies to only one third of the 25% of people injured, not one third of people questioned. The report also includes findings from other studies as if they were part of the new study which could further mislead the reader.\n\nThis was a cross sectional study, using a web-based survey targeted at US adults aged 18 to 65. The researchers contacted more than 10,000 adults in a \"nationally representative\" sample.\n\nThis type of study can give a snapshot view of what people are prepared to say in a survey about their grooming habits. However, it can't guarantee people answer truthfully.\n\nAlso, this methodology leaves any results open to accusations of selection bias. People who take the time to complete the survey may not be representative of the general public.\n\nResearchers randomly recruited people to take the survey through sampling of the US postal service database. An email request was sent out in January 2014 asking people to take part in the online survey.\n\nThe survey asked questions about people's grooming habits, experience, injuries and infections.\n\nTo ensure people weren't excluded because of lack of internet or computer access, those without access were provided with internet facilities to complete the questionnaire.\n\nParticipants also received a small points-based incentive equivalent to one dollar.\n\nThe results were analysed to find out the extent and nature of the problem, and to identify factors that seemed to increase the risk of injury.\n\nAlmost half of the people contacted declined to take part in the survey. Of the 52.5% of people (7,570) who did take part:\n\nThe most common problems were:\n\nThis may reflect the types of hair removal methods used. Shaving with a non-electric razor was the most common method (47.5%) followed by electric razor (26.9%), scissors (18.4%) and waxing (2.6%).\n\nFor women, those who reported waxing as their main method of hair removal were less likely to have repeated frequent injuries (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.43). For men (who were less likely to wax) the type of hair removal method made no difference to injury rate.\n\nWomen and men who removed all pubic hair regularly (more than 10 times per year) were more likely to report having an injury (women: AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.19; men: AOR 1.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.01).\n\nThe position adopted while grooming made some difference to the severity of injury. People were more likely to get an injury that needed medical attention if they carried out hair removal lying on their back (perhaps because they could not see what they were doing) or if other people were carrying out the hair removal.\n\nThe researchers said their research showed that \"pubic hair grooming is a widespread practice\" and so \"injury prevention efforts are necessary\". They said their study \"may contribute to the development of clinical guidelines or recommendations for safe pubic hair removal.\"\n\nPubic hair removal is now common practice, and this study suggests it is not without risk. It seems sensible to find out more about how it can be done safely, with minimal risk of injury.\n\nHowever, while the study provides useful information about peoples' experiences of pubic hair removal and injury (at least in the US), it doesn't tell us which is the safest method.\n\nAlthough waxing was linked to fewer repeated injuries among women, previous studies suggest it can be harmful if done incorrectly, leading to severe injury or infection.\n\nSimilarly, although frequent removal of all pubic hair is linked to higher risk of injury, we don't know why this is. It may simply be that doing anything regularly means you have more opportunities to make a mistake.\n\nThe research has some limitations. It's notable that almost half of people contacted didn't take the survey. It may be that the people who refused to do the survey were less likely to carry out pubic hair grooming or removal, or are more likely to be embarrassed at the thought of answering questions about it.\n\nBecause the research relies on people's own reporting of their experience, we don't know how accurate it is. People may be too embarrassed to give truthful answers, may forget minor injuries, or people who suffer major injuries may be more likely to respond to the survey.

Cable television? (We should probably blame porn.) But somewhere along the way in the last few decades, patches of pubic hair have shrunk in size. This has led to all sorts of interesting quagmires -- vajazzling, if you will -- but the most hazardous result is that pubic-grooming injuries have become the norm.\n\nA study published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association cites that 24 percent of men and 27 percent of women have injured themselves while grooming their pubic hair. Researchers looked at a representative sample of American men and women between the ages of 18 and 64 and found that over two-thirds of men and over 85 percent of women admit to grooming their pubic hair. Of the groomers, 1.4 percent experienced injuries so severe that they had to seek medical attention. And self-proclaimed super-hairy men were most at risk of injury. (The study did not mention the metric of determining hairiness.)\n\nThe injuries varied from cuts, which accounted for 61 percent of accidents, to burns from hair-removal creams, which took up 23 percent of the reported injuries. Of this injured bunch, 2.5 percent said they needed surgical intervention to drain abscesses or close sutures, for example. However, most abrasions were minor.\n\nAnd what exactly are folks injuring? For men that would be the scrotum; the pubis -- the area surrounding the pelvis -- was the most likely injury spot for women. Of course, all of these injuries could have been avoided if people left their hair alone -- but then again, the '70s are long behind us.", "id": "9550904", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "A Lot of Folks Are Getting Injured While Grooming Pubic Hair", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/08/16/16-pubic-hair-grooming.w1200.h630.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "id": "302505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pelvis"}, "id": "307108", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Abscess"}, "id": "318236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA (journal)"}, "id": "321293", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_(journal)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Androgenic hair"}, "id": "436575", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vajazzle"}, "id": "963487", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajazzle"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 211, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Men"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "19:32:00"}

And if you're a frequent groomer -- particularly if you remove all your pubic hair -- there's a 25 percent chance you've lacerated yourself in the process.\n\nIn a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dermatology on Wednesday, doctors warn that the standard method of taking a razor to your genitals for trimming, shaving, and waxing downstairs is -- surprise! -- dangerous. The researchers found that how often you groom and how much hair you remove both play significant roles in your chance of being injured.\n\nThomas Gaither, an M.D./M.A.S. student at University of California, San Francisco, and one of the authors of this study, says he was surprised by the high incidence of grooming-related injuries.\n\n\"What took us aback are how common injuries are,\" Gaither tells Inverse. Out of the respondents, 25.6 percent of them reported injuries from grooming. \"About one percent of groomers have sought medical attention because of an injury,\" adds Gaither.\n\nGaither and his colleagues surveyed 7,456 adults between the ages of 18 and 65. Respondents were asked detailed questions about their grooming habits and related injuries, including how many times they had groomed, how much hair they removed, what methods they used, and even who did the grooming.\n\nThey found that 66.5 percent of men and 85.3 percent of women reported a history of grooming. Among the 25.6 percent reporting grooming-related injuries, nearly two-thirds had cut themselves. Men overwhelmingly injured their scrotum, while women were pretty evenly divided between injuring their inner thigh and the pubis, or pubic mound; the vagina ranked a close third.\n\nThe researchers found a high correlation between how often a person groomed and injury frequency. Men who removed all hair more than 11 times in their lives were nearly twice as likely to injure themselves over their lifetimes compared to men who didn't remove all their pubic hair. Women who opted to go Brazilian more than 11 times in their lifetime are about twice as likely to be injured as opposed to women who don't.\n\nNotably, waxing seems to be the safest method of hair removal -- probably because it doesn't involve a blade (though there is still the risk of a burn).\n\n\"This is kind of a hot topic for some,\" says Gaither. \"Waxing was associated with a prevention of high-frequency injuries. In comparison to non-electric razors, electric razors, and scissors, it looked like those who use wax as their main form of grooming had fewer injuries. That's a pretty insightful thing for us.\"\n\nGaither says the next step for his team is to follow up on their previous study that correlated grooming with sexually transmitted infections. To do this, they will gather data at clinics to better understand how the timelines of grooming and infection interact.\n\nBeyond that, though, Gaither says he hopes this research will help raise awareness regarding just how common grooming is and the fact that educators are not addressing it in sexual education courses.\n\n\"We still need to figure out what's the best way to groom,\" he says.", "id": "9613303", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Doctors Say You're Grooming Your Pubes All Wrong", "image": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/20/74/2b/e1/a269/47b6/964a/ce59f0d430d2/if-you-must-groom-please-be-careful-and-above-all-dont-let-a-friend-do-it.jpeg?rect=0%2C168%2C800%2C400&fm=png&w=1200", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scissors"}, "id": "303293", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scissors"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physician"}, "id": "303806", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"}, {"label": {"eng": "Electricity"}, "id": "305536", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted disease"}, "id": "307207", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}, "id": "309248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Preventive medicine"}, "id": "310496", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frequency"}, "id": "313913", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clinic"}, "id": "314081", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"}, {"label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}, "id": "318930", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA (journal)"}, "id": "321293", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_(journal)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}, "id": "322191", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Razor"}, "id": "332138", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hair removal"}, "id": "345967", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "15:02:00"}

You catch glimpses, but it eludes you every time. Really, your sex life becomes the premise of the entire Finding Bigfoot series. One day, though, you may find yourself in the presence of this cryptid and decide, You know what? Let me clean myself up down there. But it doesn't work out so well; you end up hurting yourself. Turns out, you're not alone: People are injuring themselves while grooming their pubic hair, according to a new study. Who knew personal grooming was a full-contact sport?\n\nA JAMA Dermatology study published Wednesday found that a good chunk of people who trim their pubic region had suffered an injury at least once, according to Forbes. Researchers behind the study surveyed about 7,570 people ages 18 and 65 and discovered that at least 26 percent of respondents have battle scars from shaving, waxing, or laser hair removal; the majority reported being cut, while others have been burnt, developed a rash, or had an infection. Even more hair-raising: More than 66 percent of those participants said they have been injured more than once, Forbes reported.\n\nThe findings get worse, actually: According to MarketWatch, some of the pubic-related injuries not only required medical attention, but surgery. Those types of wounds occurred more often when a person was grooming themselves while laying on their back, rather than being helped by someone else.\n\nNot all injuries were created equal, though. Researchers found that, of those people who responded to the web survey, younger participants were more likely to suffer an injury. Same goes for men with a lot of hair. Unsurprisingly, more women reported suffering a wound than men -- 85.2 percent compared to 66.5 percent, according to MarketWatch.\n\nThe survey findings fall in line with what hospitals across the country have been seeing in their emergency rooms. According to a 2016 Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology study, injuries related to hair removal have spiked between 1991 and 2013, particularly among 19- to 34-year-olds.\n\nClearly, Americans need to be more careful when it comes to clearing out their pubic weeds. And researchers behind the JAMA Dermatology survey believe their findings could provide a basis for encouraging better grooming habits. After all, who wants their nether regions to look like they mowed their front yawn while drinking way too many martinis?\n\nOf course, I am not judging anyone from their pubic hair woes. As the old biblical saying goes, \"They who have not suffered a personal grooming boo-boo cast the first stone.\" But it is fascinating the sheer number of people who have injured themselves either in the name of personal hygiene or to meet some idealistic, ridiculous beauty standard -- or both.", "id": "9807719", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Science Says People Are Hurting Themselves More While Trimming *Down There*", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/image/2017/8/17/8fcc3f78-7cd6-4ef3-8cd0-a258338a4f23-screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-52513-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&fm=jpg&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "id": "302505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "id": "302506", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "id": "302508", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Injury"}, "id": "304994", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wound"}, "id": "306299", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Forbes"}, "id": "308584", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}, "id": "309248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving"}, "id": "332136", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hair removal"}, "id": "345967", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laser hair removal"}, "id": "348414", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Personal grooming"}, "id": "359914", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_grooming"}, {"label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}, "id": "370822", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cryptid"}, "id": "628427", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hypogastrium"}, "id": "703128", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogastrium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Finding Bigfoot"}, "id": "854100", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Bigfoot"}, {"label": {"eng": "JAMA Dermatology"}, "id": "1132772", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_Dermatology"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1142, "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty"}], "time": "19:37:00"}

Truesdale, a urologist from San Francisco was published Wednesday in the journal Jama Dermatology. According to the study, 76 percent of the participants said they removed some or all of their pubic hair almost on a regular basis out of which almost 26 percent of those adults who groomed, reported that they had suffered at least one injury including cuts, burns, and infections. Injuries were found to be more common among women (27 percent) as compared to men (24 percent).\n\nCuts were the most common injury among the adults, amounting to 61 percent of mishaps, while 23 percent were said to be burns, probably to have been caused due to waxing or the use of hair-removal creams. The study also found that the scrotum was the primary site for injury among men whereas the pubis was the most likely area for injuries among women.\n\nOther possible injuries include nicks, bumps, blisters/pimples, ingrown hair, genital infections and also might lead to itching and razor burn.\n\nFolliculitis is also a possible infection that can be caused due to pubic grooming, mainly caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus (staph) or a fungus, according to the Palo Alto Medical Foundation in California.\n\n\"We were, quite frankly, quite surprised how frequently people were presenting with injuries relating to grooming,\" said Benjamin Breyer, a urologist at the University of California, San Francisco and co-author of the study. \"Three per cent of the time [adults] are coming in [to the emergency department with a genitourinary injury, it's] with a grooming injury.\"\n\nThe study also disclosed that those who removed all of their pubic hair were more likely to report having been injured than who removed some.\n\n\"You are getting at all the nooks and crannies of your body - you are going to get places you can't see very well and that probably, in turn, leads to a greater likelihood of getting injured,\" said Beyer.\n\nHowever, researchers said that more research is required to be done in the matter to know exactly which methods are the most hazardous and lead to increased number of injuries.\n\n\"Razors were associated most [with injury], but they may be the ones that are by far used the most,\" Beyer said. \"Using electric shavers seems to be not associated with high degrees of injury - probably because you are just less likely to get cut - but you don't get as fine a shave.\"\n\nThere are proper treatments for the kinds of injuries one might suffer from. If they turn out to be serious problems, it is always recommended that one seeks medical help.\n\nFor itching sensations, you can apply 1 percent hydrocortisone two or three times per day and you must avoid shaving for at least two months. For genital infections, you should visit a doctor. You can use aloe vera to soothe your skin in case of a razor burn.\n\nIf you want to shave your pubic hair and take care that it does not cause injuries, then you must follow certain steps that includes not using an old or dull razor, using proper pair of scissors to clip your hair, using shaving creams, aloe vera creams and also make sure to keep your pubic area soft and smooth by soaking in a hot bath or shower for at least three minutes after you have shaved, according to Palo Alto Medical Foundation.", "id": "9884891", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Pubic Hair

The analysis included 7,570 participants (4,198 men) identified in January 2014 and analyzed from Aug. 1, 2016 through Feb. 1, 2017. Outcome measures included a binary of whether a grooming-related injury had occurred, whether the individual had more than five lifetime injuries, and injuries requiring medical attention.\n\nResults showed that 5,674 participants, including 66.5% of men and 85.3% of women, reported a history of grooming.

Injuries to the penis occurred in 34.8% of men, while the pubis was injured in 28.9%.\n\nAmong women, pubis injuries were most common, at 51.3%, followed by inner thigh (44.9%), vaginal (42.5%), and perineum (13.2%) injuries.\n\nIn a multivariable analysis that adjusted for age, duration of grooming, hairiness, instrument used, and grooming frequency, removal of all hair 11 times or more during a lifespan yielded a significant increase in the likelihood of injury among men (adjusted OR = 1.97; P = .002) compared with those who did not remove all pubic hair. Repeated high-frequency injuries also were more likely among men who removed all hair more than 11 times compared to those who did not (adjusted OR = 3.89; P < .001).\n\nA similar trend was reported for women who removed all pubic hair 11 times or more compared with those who did not, with injuries (adjusted OR = 2.21; P < .001) and high-frequency injuries (adjusted OR = 2.98; P < .001) reported more frequently in the former group.\n\nCompared with nonelectric blades, waxing was associated with a reduction in high-frequency injuries among women (adjusted OR = 0.11; P = .001).", "id": "9739971", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pubic hair grooming injuries common in US adults", "image": "/~/media/images/fscss/i3wyanokecdncom/healio_safe_image.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 392, "date": "2016-08-01", "amb": false, "dateEnd": "2017-02-01", "textEnd": 425}, {"textStart": 361, "date": "2014-01-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 373}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Area"}, "id": "306241", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demography"}, "id": "313339", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vagina"}, "id": "313793", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Frequency"}, "id": "313913", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thigh"}, "id": "321262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cross-sectional study"}, "id": "335116", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laceration"}, "id": "391791", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound#Laceration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Perineum"}, "id": "459604", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Multivariate statistics"}, "id": "583936", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Age adjustment"}, "id": "788864", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_adjustment"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "13:36:00"}

Of those, one in four reported injuring themselves at least once from the below-the-belt beautification. Minor lacerations were the most common type of injury, accounting for 61 percent of those reported, followed by burns and rashes. But 1.4 percent of groomers reported severe enough injuries to require medical attention. That includes antibiotics for infections or surgical interventions, such as stitches and incisions to drain an abscess.\n\nWith the data, published Wednesday in JAMA Dermatology, the researchers hope to draw attention to the hairy problem -- and pluck out factors that may contribute to injuries.\n\nDiving down into the data, they examined the specific bits most likely to get nicked during a grooming. Unsurprisingly, men who whittled around their willies were most likely to injure the scrotum and penis and less likely to injure the perineum, inner thigh, or anus. Women were most in danger of harming the pubis (the hairy region above the vagina), the inner thigh, and vagina. They were less likely to injure the perineum or anus.\n\nGroomers reported using all manner of pruning tools -- electric razors, nonelectric razors, wax, scissors, laser hair removal, electrolysis, or \"other.\" But this didn't seem to matter much; no one method was linked to a higher risk of injuries. (That said, waxing seemed to be linked to a lower risk of repeat injuries.) Also inconsequential to injury risk was how hairy a person rated themselves -- the hairiest didn't endure more harm, the researchers found.\n\nWhat did seem to matter was the frequency and extent of grooming. Both men and women risked more injuries with more grooming sessions -- moving from monthly to daily routines -- and if they aimed to snip out all the hair down there.\n\nIn terms of what increases the chances for a serious groin gash, researchers found two factors: lying on your back, rather than squatting, standing, or sitting during grooming; and having someone else do the grooming.\n\nMost groomers -- 94 percent -- reported doing the handiwork themselves. But 8.5 percent reported having their partner groom them, 3.9 percent reported professional grooming, and an intriguing 0.5 percent were \"groomed by a friend.\"\n\nThe researchers note that their study has limitations, including relying on people's admissions and memory. It's possible that minor injuries are underreported based on faulty memories while some more severe situations were omitted out of embarrassment.\n\nStill, the authors say, it's clear that pubic primping is widespread and injuries are common. \"Thus, injury-prevention efforts are necessary,\" they conclude. They hope that the data helps clinicians tease out patients who are at high risk of injuries and come up with \"clinical guidelines or recommendations for safe pubic hair removal.\"\n\nJAMA Dermatology, 2017.

Of those, 32 per cent have done it five times or more.\n\nThe survey polled nearly 8,000 American adults ranging in age from 18 to 65, with roughly equal numbers of both sexes.\n\nSixty-six per cent of men and 85 per cent of women said they've modified their pubic hair in some way, and 1,430 reported a depilation-related injury.\n\nThe vast majority of mishaps happened while people attempted to pluck, shave, wax or trim while standing up. Cuts by far were the most common complaint, at 61 per cent of all injuries, followed by burns (23 per cent) and rashes (12 per cent).\n\nThe paper's authors said it's time for health authorities to \"develop recommendations for safe grooming practices,\" which should make for some pretty great pamphlets.\n\nDebby Herbenick, director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University, who has done studies on pubic hair and sexuality but wasn't involved in this one, wasn't too troubled by the results.\n\n\"While lots of people have had some level of injuries, most are pretty mild and fleeting, so it's not a major public health concern,\" she said in an email.\n\n\"Most people who groom their pubic hair do it many, many times per year (some daily, others at least weekly), and when you think about those hundreds to tens of thousands of people who have occasionally nicked themselves or gotten razor burn, it's just not that bad. People should still exercise caution, of course.\"\n\nPast research has shown many people think pubic hair is somehow dirty or unhygienic, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Those who go bare down there are more prone to skin infections and sexually transmitted infections. (Pubic lice, on the other hand, don't tend to take up residence on the hairless).\n\nA 2015 study Herbenick worked on found that \"feeling clean\" -- not actually being clean -- is the top reason both men and women give for removing pubic hair.\n\nThe data for this most recent study on injuries was collected in 2014, when fashion magazines had just started to proclaim that pubic hair was back, and before model and self-declared \"fire-ass feminist\" Amber Rose posted a photo of herself nude from the waist down, totally au naturel. Azeala Banks recently did the same.\n\nHerbenick isn't convinced this signals a true turnaround.\n\n\"We've been hearing 'the bush is back' for at least a decade now. I do think there's a trend toward more acceptance of hair over at least the past five years, but time will tell,\" she said.\n\nThe number of people who told researchers they let a platonic friend trim, shave or wax their pubic hair\n\n27 per cent\n\nAmong those who modify their pubic hair, this is the proportion of women who have hurt themselves in the process\n\n67 per cent\n\nThe proportion of manscaping injuries that occur to the scrotum\n\n1.4 per cent\n\nRates of injury were similar between the sexes, and only a tiny proportion of people - 1.4 per cent - required a doctor's care.\n\n76\n\nMost accidents were self-inflicted.

But a quarter of them also said that their pruning practices resulted in an injury, according to a recent survey from JAMA Dermatology. A small number (1.5%) even sent themselves to the hospital.\n\nThe survey was conducted by a team of urologists at the University of California San Francisco after they noticed that about 3% of their emergency room patients were there because of pubic hair grooming-related injuries. The doctors were not surprised that their survey revealed that people who experienced these injuries also groom more frequently and extensively than their uninjured peers.\n\n\"One lesson to take from this is that if you have had significant grooming injuries, or keep getting injured, you should reconsider the areas you groom, how frequently you do it, and the extent to which you do it,\" co-author of the survey Dr. Benjamin Breyer told Time.\n\nAbout 60% of the injuries reported on the survey were cuts, leading the researchers to determine that razors are probably the riskiest way of trimming down under. Other common injuries were rashes and burns.\n\nPubic-area injuries could make people more susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases, but Breyer said that \"infections from grooming injuries are rare.\" He plans on studying the correlation between grooming nicks and cuts and sexually transmitted infections to see if there's any real connection.

Women, on the other hand, reported the pubis as the most commonly injured area.\n\nBut enough with the disturbing facts and distressing figures - just what can you do to prevent such an unwanted wound in one of your most treasured areas?\n\nIf it's not obvious enough, Breyer leaves us with a few words of wisdom: \"the things that we know can be protective is doing it just a little less frequently, and also taking off less hair in total, treating fewer areas.\"\n\nIt might not look as neat and tidy, but it may save you a very unpleasant (and slightly embarrassing) trip to the emergency room.", "id": "9752771", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Here's why you might not want to groom down there", "image": "http://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pic.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}, "id": "302539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}, "id": "304524", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Injury"}, "id": "304994", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wound"}, "id": "306299", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Risk"}, "id": "306679", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubis (bone)"}, "id": "307104", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Skin"}, "id": "308183", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}, "id": "310038", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Accountancy"}, "id": "310960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}, "id": "312495", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexual attraction"}, "id": "316550", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pun"}, "id": "322275", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun"}, {"label": {"eng": "Urology"}, "id": "327677", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California"}, "id": "329003", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"}, {"label": {"eng": "Razor"}, "id": "332138", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Groin"}, "id": "339787", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Waxing"}, "id": "339790", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hair removal"}, "id": "345967", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_removal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Genitourinary system"}, "id": "385383", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scrotum"}, "id": "404194", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 211, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Men"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 812, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders"}], "time": "18:23:00"}

An infection to the privates is significantly worse than an infection to any other part of the body.\n\nApply soap or shaving cream if using razor: You might feel the need to clean your privates in a hurry but get a nice lather going to avoid injuries.\n\nSlow down: One usually rushes while cleaning the pubic region but chances are if you are furiously cleaning the region between your legs you will end up with an injury. And it may become serious.\n\nDo not overheat the wax: Too hot the wax could do irreparable damage to your privates.\n\nExfoliate: This helps inb preventing ingrown hairs which can lead to infection.", "id": "9899546", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "5 tips to safely groom pubic hair", "image": "http://images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-r7s8taq5hp0fm1upu432k0g040-20170818143034.Medi.jpeg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "id": "302506", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}, "id": "302525", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Soap"}, "id": "303283", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap"}, {"label": {"eng": "Injury"}, "id": "304994", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"}, {"label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}, "id": "315505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foam"}, "id": "321652", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Razor"}, "id": "332138", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pubic hair"}, "id": "339793", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wax"}, "id": "346885", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "id": "347874", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaving cream"}, "id": "360619", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving_cream"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hypogastrium"}, "id": "703128", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogastrium"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}], "time": "08:04:00"}

Shave it off, give it a coconut oil hair mask, braid it, bedazzle it, whatever. Do what makes you feel good. But for heaven's sake, be safe when you're doing it.\n\nApparently, plenty of pube shavers out there have some pretty unsafe habits. Shaving while lying down, for instance, isn't advisable. Neither is shaving while looking at something other than the task at hand. And yet 11.6 and 17.5 percent of people do these things, respectively. So says a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Dermatology, in which public health researchers surveyed 7,570 Americans about their pubic hair habits.\n\nOverall, about a quarter of people who groom their pubic hair end up injuring themselves. Honestly, that's pretty impressive. Genitalia are not generally known for their smooth, flat surfaces. They're more on the wrinkly, bumpy, squishy end of the spectrum. The fact that folks can use blades to remove hair down there is a testament both to human dexterity and to our razor-engineering prowess. But none of us is perfect, and sometimes your hand just slips a little. In fact, it's pretty likely that more than a quarter of shavers have experienced injury -- it's not exactly the kind of survey question that researchers expect to get 100 percent honest answers on.\n\nBut while the truth about rate of injury may be unclear, the study does reveal some of the common mishaps. Unsurprisingly, men injured their scrotums most often. How could they not? It's like trying to shave an old, wrinkled piece of tissue paper wrapped around a couple of eggs. Penises and pubises (that's the area above and around the penis) got injured at approximately equal rates -- though probably not with equal pain.\n\nLadies nicked their pubises (pubii?) most often, followed by their inner thighs and \"vaginas,\" and finally their perineum (perinea?). It's worth noting that the study used the word vagina, even though clinically speaking the vagina is the inner part of the female anatomy. If you have a vagina, your external genitalia is called a vulva. And if you're actually cutting your vagina while shaving, you're going a little too far.\n\nOver 60 percent of all those injuries were simple cuts. Next most common was a burn (the razor type, not the fire one), and then a rash. A small (but frightening) percentage actually required medical attention. About 3 percent of people needed antibiotics, and 2.5 percent needed surgical intervention. That means 2.5 percent of people needed an abscess drained, or sutures to close a wound. Just picture that on a scrotum. Yikes.\n\nAll this being said, cuts aren't a huge deal. The human body is pretty great at healing things like that, though there is a small increased risk of catching HPV or molluscum contagiosum, which sounds like a made-up STD but is in fact a virus that causes little itchy bumps. That's because open access to your blood makes it easier for viruses to get in. On the upside, if you take all your pubic hair off you're not going to get pubic lice. Rates of lice have dropped dramatically in the 21st century, most likely because of the rise in popularity of the Brazilian wax and in removing hair in general. Both men and women are choosing to entirely rid themselves of body hair at increasing rates, so there are fewer places on Earth for those pesky lice to hide.\n\nIf you do end up with cuts -- and let's be honest, we pretty much all do -- just make sure to treat them properly. Wash gently with soap and water (razors don't tend to be super clean), then put a little ointment on to soothe the sore. Try not to irritate it too much and you should be fine in a day or so. Ingrown hairs are a pain once they develop, but you can largely prevent them by using salicylic acid or isopropanol (or both) to sanitize the area.\n\nMost importantly, only shave hair off your body for you. No one else is worth the pain.", "id": "9742931", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "A lot of people are getting injured while shaving their pubic hair", "image": "http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/medium_1x_/public/images/2017/08/beard_not_pubic_hair.jpg?itok=P2la-mcc", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "116491", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "label": {"eng": "Poil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surgery"}, "id": "302505", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "id": "302514", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human"}, "id": "302854", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Soap"}, "id": "303283", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antibacterial"}, "id": "303485", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pain"}, "id": "303798", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "304093", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "label": {"eng": "Earth"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Public health"}, "id": "304094", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"}, {"label": {"eng": "Injury"}, "id": "304994", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virus"}, "id": "305231", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wound"}, "id": "306299", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human body"}, "id": "306401", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted disease"}, "id": "307207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vulva"}, "id": "309023", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva"}, {"label": {"eng": "Penis"}, "id": "309026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Healing"}, "id": "309243", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}, "id": "309248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}, "id": "311248", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rash"}, "id": "312853", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 3, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 44, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 173, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 584, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 859, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1142, "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1240, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Skin Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Skin_Disorders"}], "time": "16:28:00"}

The study was originally published in JAMA Dermatology, and was the result of an observation made by Benjamin Breyer, a urologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Breyer noticed that a large number of adults coming to the emergency room with injuries to their undercarriage hurt themselves by trying to groom themselves. Inspired and perhaps confused by how this was happening, he co-authored a study that revealed that an awful lot of us trimming the snatch with whatever's handy in the bathroom are not being as careful as we could.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, cuts accounted for 61 percent of the injuries; an alarming 23 percent were burns, related most likely to \"waxing or the use of hair-removal creams.\" Even worse, 2.5 percent of those injuries were actually serious, and required stitches or \"the draining of abscesses\" which makes me want to fucking die.\n\nA word of advice if you want to weed-whack your basement without causing grievous injury to yourself or others: be careful!

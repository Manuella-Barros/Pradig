{"id": 232130340, "title": "Relying on coalition partners, Modi is sworn in for a rare third term as India\u2019s PM", "text": "The 73-year-old popular, but polarizing, leader is only the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to retain power for a third five-year term. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which won by landslides in 2014 and 2019, failed to secure a majority to govern on its own in the latest national election. However, Modi\u2019s National Democratic Alliance coalition won enough seats to form a government, with him at the helm. This is the first time the BJP under Modi has needed support from its regional allies to form a government after a decade of commanding the majority in Parliament. Final election results released Wednesday showed Modi\u2019s BJP won 240 seats, well below the 272 needed for a majority. Together, the parties in the NDA coalition secured 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of Parliament. Modi\u2019s coalition government now largely depends on two key regional allies \u2014 the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state and Janata Dal (United) in eastern Bihar state \u2014 to stay in power. Meanwhile, Modi\u2019s political challenger, the INDIA alliance led by the resurgent Congress party, put up a stronger-than-expected fight, doubling its strength from the last election to win 232 seats.", "summary": "The 73-year-old popular, but polarizing, leader is only the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to retain power for a third five-year term.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/relying-on-coalition-partners-modi-is-sworn-in-for-a-rare-third-term-as-indias-pm", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/aptopix-india-prime-minister-modi.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:55:06", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.019}

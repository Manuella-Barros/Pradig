Global capacity to generate electricity from renewable has been expanding at an unprecedented 8.1% annually for past five years, the report said.Increased access to treatment has averted 20.8 million AIDS-related deaths in the past three decades. New malaria vaccines being rolled out could save millions of lives. Girls in most regions are now achieving parity with boys in education.And many women are breaking glass ceilings, it said.\u201cBut the speed and scale of the change needed for sustainable development is still far too slow,\u201d Guterres said.He called for action to end wars from Gaza to Ukraine, Sudan and beyond, \u201cand to pivot from spending on destruction and war to investing in people and peace.\u201dThe secretary-general also called for greater action to combat climate change and on \u201cthe green and digital transitions.\u201dAccording to the report, there is a $4 trillion annual gap in the investments needed to help developing countries reach the sustainable development goals.Guterres called for stepped-up efforts to deliver the resources and also to reduce debt pressures and debt servicing costs, to expand access to contingency financing for countries at risk of a cash flow crisis, and to multiply the lending capacity of the World Bank and other development banks.\u201cWe must not let up on our promises \u2014 to end poverty, protect the planet and leave no one behind,\u201d the secretary-general said", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/only-17-of-targets-to-improve-life-around-the-world-are-likely-to-be-reached-by-2030-un-reports-9422268/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/cover_06a30f.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:39:30", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.26}

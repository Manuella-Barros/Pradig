{"id": 237084216, "title": "'Morally bankrupt loser': Top Trump VP contender wants to deport 20 million people", "text": "J.D. Vance, the venture capitalist-turned-Republican Ohio U.S. Senator, ignited a firestorm when he declared support for the deportation of what he claims are 20 million undocumented people in the United States. Senator Vance came to power thanks in large part to tech billionaire Peter Thiel bankrolling his campaign. Vance\u2019s book, which alleges to speak for the forgotten people in middle America, had become a best-seller while also being criticized as \u201can example of poverty porn designed to appeal to the same type of (white) viewer who may believe they understand \u2018urban poverty\u2019 because they watched HBO\u2019s \u2018The Wire.\u2019 \u201d An anonymous Twitter account with a bio that literally says, \u201cJust here to collect liberal tears,\u201d over the weekend had posted: \u201cI\u2019m so sick of this administration. I\u2019m 23 years old. I\u2019m ready to buy a house and start putting my roots down, but I have to stick to renting because the house market is ridiculous. Vote for the convicted felon. This shit is getting old.\u201d READ MORE: Republicans in 10 States Have Now Used Courts to Block Biden\u2019s LGBTQ Student Protections Former journalist James Surowiecki, author of the book, \u201cThe Wisdom of Crowds,\u201d responded: \u201cHow will Trump\u2019s policies make it easier for this guy to buy a house? He has no answer. (Literally \u2013 I asked.) It\u2019s just that \u2018Mortgage rates were low under Trump, and they\u2019re higher under Biden; therefore, Trump will bring mortgage rates down.\u2019 It\u2019s magical thinking.\u201d That\u2019s when Senator Vance, a top contender on Trump\u2019s vice presidential running mate shortlist, decided to ride the wave of anti-immigrant hate that has fueled the ex-president\u2019s campaigns. \u201cNot having 20 million illegal aliens who need to be housed (often at public expense) will absolutely make housing more affordable for American citizens,\u201d Vance, a multi-millionaire, according to Forbes, claimed to great criticism. \u201cBut I see the left\u2019s strategy of making fun of people for suffering under Biden policies continues apace.\u201d Housing, including mortgage rates, while high in the U.S., are far higher in other developed nations, thanks in large part to the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. economy is the best in the world right now \u2013 number one, according to The Wall Street Journal in April. Vance was quickly scorched: \u201cYou are so full of shit. 20 million people being rounded, put in camps, and deported will break the economy,\u201d declared former Lincoln Project executive director Fred Wellman. \u201cYou also act like it will be free to do this. How many billions will be spent to build the fascist \u2018deportation force?\u2019 Camps? Flights? What does any of that have to do with interest rates and housing costs? You are a liar and a propagandist. It\u2019s pathetic how someone who was once a Marine is such a morally bankrupt loser now.\u201d READ MORE: Whoopi Goldberg Mocks \u2018Crook\u2019 Trump for \u2018Black Church\u2019 Trip Immigration advocate Thomas Kennedy wrote: \u201cA U.S. Senator is advocating for a mass deportation program so that homes of immigrants can be seized and redistributed. Also the 20 million figure isn\u2019t even accurate. Just a terrible person.\u201d \u201cThis is a dumbass bumper-sticker slogan answer and his own angry hallucination, all showing that the intellect gap between the nutjobs and those considered the GOP\u2019s most sage and sophisticated thinkers is much more narrow that you\u2019ve been led to believe,\u201d responded Los Angeles Tribune investigative reporter Joe Rossi. \u201cPeople should take a moment to imagine the amount of terror, violence, expense and destruction that is going to be necessary to deport TWENTY MILLION people. And also, think the won\u2019t just mess up and grab a whole bunch of American citizens while they\u2019re at it?\u201d observed MSNBC host Chris Hayes. \u201cLet\u2019s deport all the people who build the houses and find out what happens to housing prices. Great plan!\u201d mocked Robby Soave, senior editor of the Libertarian magazine Reason. \u201cHitler also carried out mass deportations to create more living space for the Volksgemeinschaft,\u201d reminded journalist Aaron Rupar. American Immigration Council Policy Director Aaron Reichlin-Melnick weighed in: \u201cSetting aside that there aren\u2019t 20 million undocumented immigrants (actual number is 12-15 million, depending on if you count new arrivals facing removal proceedings in the number), it\u2019s pretty dark to say the US should seize and redistribute millions of peoples\u2019 homes.\u201d Talking Points Memo publisher Josh Marshall served up this take: READ MORE: Democrats Have One Way to Correct Corruption of Justices Thomas and Alito: Expert", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/jd-vance.jpg?id=52187493&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C290%2C0%2C290\"/><br/><br/><p>J.D.

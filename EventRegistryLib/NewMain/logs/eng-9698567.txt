positions after commander killed", "body": "Beirut (Lebanon) (AFP) - Hezbollah said it fired more than 100 rockets at Israeli positions on Wednesday in retaliation for a strike that killed a senior commander in Lebanon, the movement's second such loss in recent weeks.\n\nHezbollah has traded near daily cross-border fire with the Israeli army since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, triggering war in Gaza, but an uptick in bellicose rhetoric from both sides in recent weeks has raised fears of all-out war.\n\n\"A Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon was killed\" in an \"Israeli strike on a car in Tyre\", a source close to the group told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nThe Iran-backed group said that \"commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser\", also known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\" had been killed, and also announced the death of a second fighter.\n\nThe Israeli army said in a statement that it \"eliminated\" Nasser, saying he was \"the commander of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation's Aziz Unit which is responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon at Israeli territory\".\n\nIn a statement, Hezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the attack and assassination that the enemy carried out\" in south Lebanon's Tyre, its fighters attacked two positions in the Israeli-annexed Syrian Golan Heights \"with 100 Katyusha rockets\".\n\nThe militant group also claimed another retaliatory attack with \"Falaq rockets\" on a base in northern Israel.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson told AFP that about 100 rocket launches had been made towards Israel from Lebanon.\n\n'Prevent a conflagration'\n\nThe source close to Hezbollah said Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, a commander killed in an Israeli strike last month who was described by a Lebanese military source at the time as the \"most important\" Hezbollah commander killed to date.\n\nThat strike prompted Hezbollah to intensify its attacks on Israeli targets, firing barrages of rockets across the border in the days that followed.\n\nThe Israeli army statement Wednesday said that Nasser and Abdallah \"served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon\".\n\nA second source close to Hezbollah, also requesting anonymity, said Nasser was the third senior Hezbollah commander to be killed in almost nine months of hostilities.\n\nIn January, a security source said an Israeli strike killed Wissam Hassan Tawil, another top commander from the group.\n\nNasser's death followed a relative easing of cross-border exchanges over the past week, after threats on both sides had intensified.\n\nHezbollah announced a series of other attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Wednesday, while Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported Israeli attacks in other parts of south Lebanon.\n\nFears the violence, so far largely restricted to the border area, could turn into all-out war have sparked a flurry of diplomatic efforts to lower tensions.\n\nOn Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a \"conflagration\" between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made repeated visits to Lebanon in recent months, was due in Paris on Wednesday where he was due to meet with Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 495 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors":

A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously, in line with regulations, said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nNasser is the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a speech honoring Abdullah, said he played a pivotal role on the front line since clashes began on Oct. 8, leading the Nasr Unit.\n\nHezbollah said that in response to the killing of Nasser, it launched Falaq rockets with heavy warheads targeting the headquarters of the Israeli military's 769th Brigade in Kiryat Shmona, as well as 100 salvos of Katyusha rockets targeting the headquarters of Israel's 210th division and the Kilaa air base in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\n\nThe group also shared footage of Nasser taking part in what they said was an operation at an Israeli military outpost in southern Lebanon in 1999 back when it was under occupation.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" militants in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel in October, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nThe group maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says, it will continue with its attacks to pile pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation should Hezbollah not stop its attacks.\n\nHezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that Israel cannot expect the group's attacks to remain limited should it launch a military operation within Lebanon, even if it aims to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nA senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between Lebanon and Israel, was set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris on Wednesday as part of diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.\n\nFrench officials had invited Hochstein to the French capital to discuss the latest developments in their ongoing diplomatic scrambles, according to administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Abby Sewell and Aamer Madhani of The Associated Press.\n\nThis picture released by Hezbollah media relations office, shows a portrait of Hezbollah commander Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit his car, in the southern costal town of Tyre, Lebanon, Wednesday, July 3, 2024. The strike took place as global diplomatic efforts have intensified in recent weeks to prevent escalating clashes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military from spiralling into an all-out war that could possibly lead to a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran.

A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously in line with regulations, said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nNasser is the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a speech honoring Abdullah said he played a pivotal role on the front line since clashes began on Oct. 8, leading the Nasr Unit.\n\nHezbollah said in response to the killing of Nasser, it launched Falaq rockets with heavy warheads targeting the headquarters of the Israeli military's 769th Brigade in Kiryat Shmona, as well as 100 salvos of Katyusha rockets targeting the headquarters of Israel's 210th division and the Kilaa air base in the Golan Heights.\n\nThe group also shared footage of Nasser taking part in what they said was an operation at an Israeli military outpost in southern Lebanon in 1999 back when it was under occupation.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" terrorists in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after the Oct. 7 surprise Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed more than 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nSenior adviser to President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between Lebanon and Israel, is set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris on Wednesday as part of his ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the

One of the sources said a second Hezbollah fighter and a civilian were also killed.\n\nNasser was of the same rank and importance as Taleb Abdallah, a top commander who was killed by an Israeli strike in June, prompting Hezbollah to fire its largest barrages of drones and rockets yet in retaliation, the sources said.\n\nThe Israeli military statement said Nasser and Abdallah \"served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon\".\n\nSenior Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah said Nasser had known he was a target but had not left the battlefield in nine months. Hezbollah would inflict its \"punitive response\" on Israel for \"its crime, so that this enemy understands that the arm of the resistance is long\", he said.\n\nThe hostilities have inflicted a heavy toll on both sides of the frontier, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.\n\nIsraeli attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and 87 civilians, according to Reuters tallies.

Hezbollah -- a group which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran but believed to be larger and much better armed -- responded with another barrage of rocket fire.\n\nHezbollah has stepped up its attacks since Israel, which shares its northern border with Lebanon, launched the war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack. Hezbollah has said it won't stop firing rockets at Israel until there's a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it intercepted drones and other projectiles fired from southern Lebanon on Thursday and that some of the falling debris caused fires on the ground. The military did not report any casualties, but said it was responding to the Hezbollah fire by \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon.\"\n\nSenior Hezbollah commander Muhammad Nimah Nasser was killed in an Israeli attack on July 3, 2024\n\nThe escalating exchange of fire across the border has been deadly. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 435 deaths on that side of the border as of June 26. About 90 of those killed by Israeli shelling have been civilians, according to the Al Jazeera network.\n\nIn Israel at least 27 people have been killed by Hezbollah rocket and drone attacks since October, including 10 civilians, according to previous statements by Israeli authorities.\n\nThe clashes have also sparked an exodus, forcing tens of thousands of people in both northern Israel and southern Lebanon to flee their homes across the border region.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah fought a bloody war in 2006, and the U.S. government has voiced concern over the prospect of a full-scale war that could prompt Iran's proxy groups across the region to target American forces based in neighboring countries. They have already done so a few times since October, including a drone strike on an American base in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops in January.\n\nThe Biden administration has been working both with public diplomacy and behind closed doors to try to prevent that from happening.\n\nIsrael's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that his country would prefer a diplomatic solution, but

A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously in line with regulations, said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nIRAN VOWS TO BACK HEZBOLLAH IN FIGHT WITH ISRAEL AS IRGC GENERAL RENEWS THREAT OF IMMINENT MISSILE STRIKE\n\nNasser is the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a speech honoring Abdullah said he played a pivotal role on the front line since clashes began on Oct. 8 leading the Nasr Unit.\n\nHezbollah said in response to the killing of Nasser, it launched Falaq rockets with heavy warheads targeting the headquarters of the Israeli military's 769th Brigade in Kiryat Shmona, as well as 100 salvos of Katyusha rockets targeting the headquarters of Israel's 210th division and the Kilaa air base in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\n\nThe group also shared footage of Nasser taking part in what they said was an operation at an Israeli military outpost in southern Lebanon in 1999 back when it was under occupation.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" militants in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel in October, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nThe group maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says it will continue with its attacks to pile pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation should Hezbollah not stop its attacks.\n\nHezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that Israel cannot expect the group's attacks to remain limited should it launch a military operation within Lebanon, even if it aims to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nSenior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between Lebanon and Israel, is set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris on Wednesday as part of his ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the

A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously in line with regulations, said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nIRAN VOWS TO BACK HEZBOLLAH IN FIGHT WITH ISRAEL AS IRGC GENERAL RENEWS THREAT OF IMMINENT MISSILE STRIKE\n\nNasser is the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a speech honoring Abdullah said he played a pivotal role on the front line since clashes began on Oct. 8 leading the Nasr Unit.\n\nHezbollah said in response to the killing of Nasser, it launched Falaq rockets with heavy warheads targeting the headquarters of the Israeli military's 769th Brigade in Kiryat Shmona, as well as 100 salvos of Katyusha rockets targeting the headquarters of Israel's 210th division and the Kilaa air base in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\n\nThe group also shared footage of Nasser taking part in what they said was an operation at an Israeli military outpost in southern Lebanon in 1999 back when it was under occupation.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" militants in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel in October, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nThe group maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says it will continue with its attacks to pile pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation should Hezbollah not stop its attacks.\n\nHezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that Israel cannot expect the group's attacks to remain limited should it launch a military operation within Lebanon, even if it aims to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nSenior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between

The death marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict. The U.S. is pushing for de-escalation amid fears of wider conflict. Casualties on both sides are mounting.\n\nAn Israeli strike killed one of Hezbollah's top commanders in south Lebanon on Wednesday, prompting retaliatory rocket fire by the Iran-backed group into Israel as their dangerously poised conflict rumbled on. The Israeli military said it had struck and eliminated Hezbollah's Mohammed Nasser, calling him commander of a unit responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon at Israel.\n\nNasser, killed by an airstrike near the city of Tyre in southern Lebanon, was the one of the most senior Hezbollah commanders to die yet in the conflict, two security sources in Lebanon said. Sparked by the Gaza war, the hostilities have raised concerns about a wider and ruinous conflict between the heavily armed adversaries, prompting U.S. diplomatic efforts aimed at deescalation.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israeli forces were hitting Hezbollah \"very hard every day\" and will be ready to take any action necessary against the group, though the preference is to reach a negotiated arrangement. Hezbollah began firing at Israeli targets at the border after its Palestinian ally Hamas launched the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, declaring support for the Palestinians and saying it would cease fire when Israel stops its Gaza offensive.\n\nHezbollah announced at least two attacks in response to what it called \"the assassination\", saying it launched 100 Katyusha rockets at an Israeli military base and its Iranian-made Falaq missiles at another base in the town of Kiryat Shmona near the Israeli-Lebanese border. Israel's Channel 12 broadcaster reported that dozens of rockets were fired into northern Israel from Lebanon. There were no reports of casualties. The Israeli Defence Ministry said that air raid sirens sounded in several parts of northern Israel.\n\nIsrael's military did not give a number of rockets launched but said most of them fell in open areas, some were intercepted, while a number of launches fell in the area of Kiryat Shmona. It added that no injuries were reported but firefighters were working to extinguish a number of fires that were ignited by the rocket attack.\n\nFollowing the rocket salvos, it said, Israeli fighter jets struck a Hezbollah launcher that was used to fire the barrages toward Israel as well as two additional launchers. The sources in Lebanon said Nasser was responsible for a section of Hezbollah's operations at the frontier. One of the sources said a second Hezbollah fighter and a civilian were also killed.\n\nNasser was of the same rank and importance as Taleb Abdallah, a top commander who was killed by an Israeli strike in June, prompting Hezbollah to fire its largest barrages of drones and rockets yet in retaliation, the sources said. The Israeli military statement said Nasser and Abdallah \"served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon\".\n\nSenior Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah said Nasser had known he was a target but had not left the battlefield in nine months. Hezbollah would inflict its \"punitive response\" on Israel for \"its crime, so that this enemy understands that the arm of the resistance is long\", he said. The hostilities have inflicted a heavy toll on both sides of the frontier, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.\n\nIsraeli attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and 87 civilians, according to Reuters tallies. Israel says fire from Lebanon has killed 18 soldiers and 10 civilians.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_14_21_53_6689637.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1426, "textEnd": 1432}], "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt said about 200 \"projectiles\" were launched toward the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and over 20 drones into Israeli territory, but that it had intercepted some of them.\n\nIsrael after Hezbollah's attack struck various towns in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah's \"military structures\" in the southern border towns of Ramyeh and Houla. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported an Israeli drone strike of Houla killed at least one person. Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over the Lebanese capital and other areas in the country.\n\nIsrael on Wednesday acknowledged that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours after the killing, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nHashem Safieddine, head of Hezbollah's Executive Council, vowed that the group will continue its retaliatory attacks, \"targeting new sites they never imagined would be hit.\"\n\n\"The enemy sometimes acknowledges these hits and sometimes does not, but it is certain that there have been many casualties,\" he said at Nasser's funeral.\n\nNasser was of great importance to Hezbollah, which said he took part in battles in conflicts in Syria and Iraq from 2011 until 2016 and fought in the group's last war with Israel in 2006. Two other senior Hezbollah commanders have also been killed.\n\nThe U.S. and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiraling into an all-out war, which they fear could spillover across the region. Washington in its shuttle diplomatic efforts initially hoped for calm along the Lebanon-Israel border in a deal that is not linked to the war in Gaza. However, since the U.S. has called for Hamas to agree to a cease-fire proposal presented by President Joe Biden, it has said that an end to the war in Gaza would lead to calm in Lebanon and northern Israel as well.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The group's leadership says it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and that while it does not want war, it is ready for one.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail.\n\nHezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians -- have been killed.\n\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.\n\nIn 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war that ended in a draw.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news",

In response to Hezbollah's rocket barrage, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned of a potential ground offensive deep into Lebanon if the attacks persisted.\n\nThe tanks \"coming out of the battle in Rafah can reach as far as the Litani,\" Gallant remarked during a visit near the Gaza Strip border. The Litani is Lebanon's longest river that stretches from the country's center to its south.\n\nDespite expressing a preference for a ceasefire, Gallant emphasized Israel's readiness for military action. Hezbollah, for its part, previously said it would stop its attacks once Israel agrees to a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nREAD MORE: Islamic Group leader 'killed in Israeli airstrike in eastern Lebanon'\n\nTensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before.

killed", "body": "Hezbollah said it fired more than 100 rockets at Israeli positions on Wednesday in retaliation for a strike that killed a senior commander in Lebanon, the movement's second such loss in recent weeks.\n\nHezbollah has traded near daily cross-border fire with the Israeli army since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, triggering war in Gaza, but a recent uptick in bellicose rhetoric from both sides has raised fears of all-out war.\n\n\"A Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon was killed\" in an \"Israeli strike on a car in Tyre\", a source close to the group told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nThe Iran-backed group said that \"commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser\", also known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\" was killed in the strike, and also announced the death of a second fighter.\n\nThe Israeli army said that it \"eliminated\" Nasser, saying he was the commander of Hezbollah's \"Aziz Unit which is responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon at Israeli territory\".\n\nHezbollah said that \"as part of the response\" to Nasser's killing, its fighters attacked two positions in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights \"with 100 Katyusha rockets\".\n\nAlso in retaliation, it said it fired \"dozens of Katyusha rockets\" at one of the positions, and \"Falaq rockets\" and heavy duty Burkan missiles at two military sites in northern Israel.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson told AFP that about 100 rocket launches had been made towards Israel from Lebanon.\n\nA separate Israeli army statement said emergency services were \"operating to extinguish a number of fires\" caused by one of the attacks, in northern Israel's Kiryat Shmona area.\n\n'Very worried'\n\nThe source close to Hezbollah said Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, a commander killed in an Israeli strike last month who was described by a Lebanese military source at the time as the \"most important\" Hezbollah commander killed to date.\n\nThe Israeli army statement said that Nasser and Abdallah \"served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon\".\n\nA second source close to Hezbollah, also requesting anonymity, said Nasser was the third senior Hezbollah commander to be killed in almost nine months of hostilities.\n\nIn January, a security source said an Israeli strike killed Wissam Hassan Tawil, another top commander from the group.\n\nHezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said Nasser's killing \"will not drive\" the movement to retreat.\n\nInstead, Hezbollah will \"increase the pace of its pressure\" on Israel, Fadlallah said in a statement carried by Lebanon's state-run National News Agency.\n\nNasser's death followed a relative easing of cross-border exchanges over the past week, after threats on both sides had intensified.\n\nHezbollah announced other attacks on Israeli troops and positions on Wednesday, while the NNA reported Israeli raids elsewhere in south Lebanon.\n\nFears the violence, so far largely restricted to the border area, could turn into all-out war have sparked a flurry of diplomatic efforts to lower tensions.\n\n\"We're very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire,\" United Nations chief Antonio Guterres's spokesman said Wednesday.\n\nSpokesman Stephane Dujarric warned of the potential risks to the region \"as a whole if we were to find ourselves in a full fledged conflict\".\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made repeated visits to Lebanon, was due in Paris on Wednesday and was set to meet France's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 495 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [],

REUTERS\n\nLebanon's Hezbollah launched a big rocket and drone attack at Israel on Thursday and threatened to hit new targets in retaliation for the killing of a top commander, in the latest surge of violence in the steadily worsening conflict across the border.\n\nSparked by the Gaza war, the conflict between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel has been gradually intensifying for months, raising fears of a full-scale war, which both sides have indicated they want to avoid and diplomats are working to prevent.\n\nAs the latest violence played out in areas at or near the frontier - in keeping with the pattern of the last nine months - the sound of sonic booms rattled nerves for the second successive day in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli jets broke the sound barrier over several areas of the country, Lebanon's National News Agency reported.\n\nHezbollah said it launched more than 200 rockets and a swarm of drones at 10 Israeli military sites in retaliation for Israel's killing of Hezbollah commander Mohammed Nasser in the south on Wednesday. Nasser is one of the most senior Hezbollah commanders to be killed by Israel during the conflict.\n\nThe Israeli military said around \"200 projectiles and over 20 suspicious aerial targets were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory\", a number of which were intercepted by Israeli air defences and fighter jets.\n\nIsrael's ambulance service said no casualties were reported. The Israeli military said some of the drones and interceptor shrapnel set off fires.\n\nThe Israeli air force \"struck Hezbollah military structures\" in the areas of Ramyeh and Houla\", it said, referring to two villages in south Lebanon.\n\nSenior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine, speaking at an event in Beirut commemorating Nasser, indicated his group would widen its targeting.\n\n\"The series of responses continues in succession, and this series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit,\" Safieddine said.\n\nDIPLOMATIC PUSH\n\nThe United States has been leading diplomatic efforts to deescalate the fighting. Hezbollah has said it will not cease fire as long as Israel continues its offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe hostilities have inflicted a heavy toll on both sides of the frontier, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.\n\nAmos Hochstein, a senior U.S. official at the heart of the diplomacy, discussed French and American efforts to restore calm in meetings with French officials on Wednesday, a White House official said.\n\n\"France and the United States share the goal of resolving the current conflict across the Blue Line by diplomatic means, allowing Israeli and Lebanese civilians to return home with long-term assurances of safety and security,\" the official said, referring to the demarcation line between the two neighbours.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday Israeli forces were hitting Hezbollah \"very hard every day\" and will be ready to take any action necessary against the group, though the preference is to reach a negotiated arrangement.\n\nHezbollah also launched rockets at Israel on Wednesday in retaliation for Nasser's killing.\n\nHezbollah began firing at Israeli targets along the border with Lebanon after its Palestinian ally Hams launched an attack on Israel on Oct 7, declaring its support for the Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and some 90 civilians, according to Reuters tallies.

A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously in line with regulations, said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nNaameh is the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike 11 June.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a speech honoring Abdullah said he played a pivotal role on the front line since clashes began on 8 October leading the Nasr Unit.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the attack.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel in October, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nThe group maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says it will continue with its attacks to pile pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation should Hezbollah not stop its attacks.\n\nHezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that Israel cannot expect the group's attacks to remain limited should it launch a military operation within Lebanon, even if it aims to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nSenior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nFollowing the attack, Israel struck various towns in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah's \"military structures\" in the southern border towns of Ramyeh and Houla.\n\nLebanon's state-run National News Agency reported an Israeli drone strike of Houla killed at least one person. Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over the Lebanese capital and other areas in the country.\n\nIsrael on Wednesday acknowledged that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours after the killing, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nHashem Safieddine, head of Hezbollah's executive council, vowed that the group will continue its retaliatory attacks, \"targeting new sites they never imagined would be hit\".\n\nNasser was of great importance to Hezbollah, which said he took part in battles in conflicts in Syria and Iraq from 2011 until 2016 and fought in the group's last war with Israel in 2006.\n\nTwo other senior Hezbollah commanders have also been killed.\n\nThe US and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiralling into an all-out war, which they fear could spill over across the region.\n\nWashington in its shuttle diplomatic efforts initially hoped for calm along the Lebanon-Israel border in a deal that is not linked to the war in Gaza.\n\nHowever, since the US has called for Hamas to agree to a ceasefire proposal presented by President Joe Biden, it has said that an end to the war in Gaza would lead to calm in Lebanon and northern Israel as well.\n\nThe group's leadership says it will stop its attacks once there is a ceasefire in Gaza, and that while it does not want war, it is ready for one.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail.\n\nHezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to US President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians -- have been killed.\n\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000

The Lebanese group said it fired 100 Katyusha rockets against an army position in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and hit another in the northern town of Kriyat Shmona with artillery fire.\n\nIsrael said some of the rockets were intercepted over Kiryat Shmona and others fell in open areas.\n\nIsrael has killed hundreds of members of the Iran-backed militia, including other senior figures, since the two sides began near-daily cross-border fire in October. The skirmishes started after the onsent of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has raised fears of an all-out war that could draw in Tehran and other regional powers, and countries including the US, France and Germany are working to prevent an escalation.\n\nHezbollah is a much stronger force than Hamas, in terms of numbers of fighters and its arsenal of missiles and rockets.\n\nIsrael took responsibility for the strike that killed Nasser, saying he led rocket and missile attacks from Lebanon on Israeli civilians and communities.\n\n\"Nasser directed a large number of terror attacks toward Israel both during and before the war,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a post on Telegram.\n\nHezbollah has been firing missiles into Israel in solidarity with Hamas, whose Oct. 7 attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are considered terrorist organizations by the US.\n\n\"We are hitting Hezbollah very hard every day and we will be fully prepared to carry out any action required in Lebanon or reach an agreement -- from a position of strength,\" Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. \"We prefer the latter, but if reality forces us, we will know how to fight.\"\n\nA month ago, Hezbollah escalated its attacks after Israel killed of a senior military commander called Taleb Abdullah. The Associated Press said Nasser is the most senior Hezbollah official to have been killed since Abdullah.\n\nNasser took part in operations in Iraq and in Syria between 2011 and 2015, when Hezbollah supported President Bashar Al-Assad in the country's civil war. Hezbollah also confirmed he planned and supervised several assaults against Israel since Oct. 7.\n\nHezbollah has repeatedly told mediators it will only halt its attacks once there's a cease-fire in Gaza. The US, Egypt and Qatar have been trying to broker such a deal between Israel and Hamas for months.\n\nIsrael wants Hezbollah fighters to retreat at least 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the border. That should allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to bring back tens of thousands of civlians who were evacuated from the north of Israel once the skirmishes began.\n\nOn the Lebanese side of the border, a similar number of people have fled and Israeli strikes have leveled several neighborhoods. Lebanon is reeling from an economic and financial meltdown that started nearly four years ago and a war on its soil could spell more devastation.\n\nThe group has said that while it doesn't want a war with Israel, it is ready for one. An Iranian official told the Financial Times this week that Tehran would support Hezbollah directly and via other allied militias in the region in the event of a full-blown conflict.\n\nIsraeli bonds have been among the worst performers in emerging markets in the past two weeks, in part because of tensions with Hezbollah worsening.\n\n--With assistance from Galit Altstein and Alisa Odenheimer.",

Hezbollah -- a group which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran but believed to be larger and much better armed -- responded with another barrage of rocket fire.\n\nHezbollah has stepped up its attacks since Israel, which shares its northern border with Lebanon, launched the war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack. Hezbollah has said it won't stop firing rockets at Israel until there's a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it intercepted drones and other projectiles fired from southern Lebanon on Thursday and that some of the falling debris caused fires on the ground. The military did not report any casualties, but said it was responding to the Hezbollah fire by \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon.\"\n\nThe escalating exchange of fire across the border has been deadly. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 435 deaths on that side of the border as of June 26. About 90 of those killed by Israeli shelling have been civilians, according to the Al Jazeera network.\n\nIn Israel at least 27 people have been killed by Hezbollah rocket and drone attacks since October, including 10 civilians, according to previous statements by Israeli authorities.\n\nThe clashes have also sparked an exodus, forcing tens of thousands of people in both northern Israel and southern Lebanon to flee their homes across the border region.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah fought a bloody war in 2006, and the U.S. government has voiced concern over the prospect of a full-scale war that could prompt Iran's proxy groups across the region to target American forces based in neighboring countries. They have already done so a few times since October, including a drone strike on an American base in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops in January.\n\nThe Biden administration has been working both with public diplomacy and behind closed doors to try to prevent that from happening.\n\nIsrael's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that his country would prefer a diplomatic solution, but \"if reality forces us, we will know how to fight.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

An Israeli airstrike killed Muhammad Nimah Nasser in the city of Tyre on the coast of southern Lebanon on July 3.\n\nNasser was the commander of Hezbollah's Aziz Unit, and his death comes two and a half weeks after another Israeli airstrike killed the commander of Hezbollah's Nasr Unit, Taleb Sami Abdallah, on June 12. Hezbollah previously fired more than 215 rockets at Israel in response to the killing of Abdallah.\n\nThe pro-Iran media outlet Al-Mayadeen reported that Nasser was born in 1965 in Haddatha, a small village in the Bint Jbeil District in southern Lebanon that's about five miles from the Israeli border. The report claimed he was killed in a drone strike that targeted a car he was in with other men. Another member of Hezbollah, Muhammad Ghassan Khashab, was also killed.\n\nThe IDF said that it \"eliminated the terrorist Muhammad Nimah Nasser, the commander of the Hezbollah terrorist organization's Aziz Unit which is responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon at Israeli territory.\" According to the IDF statement, Nasser took over the Aziz unit in 2016 and \"led the firing of rockets and anti-tank missiles from southwestern Lebanon toward Israeli civilians, communities, and security forces. Furthermore, Nasser directed a large number of terror attacks toward Israel both during and before the war, and he previously held several central roles within the Hezbollah terrorist organization.\"\n\nThe IDF noted that Nasser was a counterpart of Abdullah, \"the commander of the Nasr Unit, who was eliminated last month. Together, they served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon.\"\n\nHezbollah carried out new attacks on Israel in the wake of the latest killing. Sirens sounded in the various areas, including the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona. The city was evacuated in October, and only a few thousand of its 24,000 residents remain. Sirens also sounded in Metula and Manara, two Israeli communities on the Lebanon border. Later in the afternoon, more sirens sounded in Beit Hillel and Kfar Giladi in the Huleh Valley before sunset. In addition, there were sirens in Misgav Am, Margaliot, and Tel Hai, all areas near Kiryat Shmona.\n\nThe airstrike on Nasser follows two months of Hezbollah escalation and a desire by Israeli officials to end Hezbollah's eight months of attacks on northern Israeli communities. Hezbollah has said it will not stop its attacks until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nIranian media have emphasized claims of Hezbollah's success in these attacks. An article on July 3 in Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) claimed that \"fleeing Zionist settlers\" have become refugees in Israeli hotels over the last eight months due to Hezbollah's attacks. Around 50,000 Israelis remain evacuated from northern communities; many reside in hotels, and Iran and Hezbollah see this situation as a victory.\n\nIn other developments, Iran's top diplomat, acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani, warned on July 3 that if Israel increases attacks on Hezbollah, leading to a wider war, then Hezbollah will turn Lebanon into an \"eternal hell\" for any Israeli invasion.\n\nHezbollah's response to the killing of Nasser followed attacks on July 2 when the group launched 15 rockets at northern Israel.\n\n\"Additionally, IDF troops identified a terrorist entering a Hezbollah military structure in the area of Yarine in southern Lebanon. Shortly following the identification, the IAF struck the military structure from which the terrorist operated,\" the IDF said. Overnight between July 2 and July 3, the Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon, including Blida, Yaroun, Aitaroun, Labbouneh, Chihine, and Tayr Harfa.\n\nThe IDF continues to prepare for a possible escalation in the north. Israel recently established the 810 Brigade, called the \"Mountain Brigade,\" which is designed to guard Mount Dov and Mount Hermon on the border with Lebanon. This new territorial brigade, stationed at a key border area between Israeli forces in the Galilee and the Golan Heights, is designed to ease the burden on the 91 Division, also deployed on the Lebanon border. The new brigade comes under the command of the 210th Division in the Golan.\n\nThe Mountain Brigade recently conducted a drill designed to increase its readiness for operations in the north. Various units deployed in northern Israel have conducted similar training as Israel prepares for a possible escalation with Hezbollah.\n\nReporting from Israel, Seth J.

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt said about 200 \"projectiles\" were launched toward the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and over 20 drones into Israeli territory, but that it had intercepted some of them.\n\nIsrael after Hezbollah's attack struck various towns in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah's \"military structures\" in the southern border towns of Ramyeh and Houla. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported an Israeli drone strike of Houla killed at least one person. Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over the Lebanese capital and other areas in the country.\n\nIsrael on Wednesday acknowledged that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours after the killing, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nHashem Safieddine, head of Hezbollah's Executive Council, vowed that the group will continue its retaliatory attacks, \"targeting new sites they never imagined would be hit.\"\n\n\"The enemy sometimes acknowledges these hits and sometimes does not, but it is certain that there have been many casualties,\" he said at Nasser's funeral.\n\nNasser was of great importance to Hezbollah, which said he took part in battles in conflicts in Syria and Iraq from 2011 until 2016 and fought in the group's last war with Israel in 2006. Two other senior Hezbollah commanders have also been killed.\n\nThe U.S. and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiraling into an all-out war, which they fear could spillover across the region. Washington in its shuttle diplomatic efforts initially hoped for calm along the Lebanon-Israel border in a deal that is not linked to the war in Gaza. However, since the U.S. has called for Hamas to agree to a cease-fire proposal presented by President Joe Biden, it has said that an end to the war in Gaza would lead to calm in Lebanon and northern Israel as well.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The group's leadership says it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and that while it does not want war, it is ready for one.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail.\n\nHezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians -- have been killed.\n\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.\n\nIn 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war that ended in a draw.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

An Iran-aligned group later claimed to have fired 100 Katyusha rockets at Israeli military positions.\n\nThe group's Telegram announcement of Nasser's death did not provide a location, but a source previously told Al Jazeera that a commander was killed in the Hosh area of Tire in southern Lebanon. A person close to the group confirmed to the AFP news agency that Nasser was killed in a tire attack.\n\nThe source said Nasser held the same rank as another top commander, Taleb Abdullah, who was killed in an Israeli strike in June. At the time, Abdullah was the highest-ranking Hezbollah military officer killed since fighting began with Israel on Oct. 8 in response to the bombing of Gaza. Following Abdullah's killing, Hezbollah launched its largest barrage of rockets into northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed it had targeted Nasser, saying he was an \"enemy\" of Abdullah and responsible for Hezbollah's \"anti-tank and rocket attacks from southwest Lebanon.\" In January, an Israeli strike also killed another top commander of the group, Wissam al-Tawil.\n\nThe latest attacks come amid infighting and accusatory rhetoric between Hezbollah and Israeli officials, which have drawn U.S., European and Arab mediators to prevent a wider territorial expansion.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in late June that Israeli forces should shift their focus to northern Israel, while far-right Israeli ministers called for a full-scale invasion of Hezbollah-held territory in Lebanon.\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel was trying to prevent a wider war, but warned that its military had the ability to take \"Lebanon back to the Stone Age\".\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group was prepared to fight \"without any restrictions, rules and ceilings\" in the event of a major Israeli attack.\n\nFor its part, Iran has warned that \"all resistance fronts\" will face Israel if it attacks Lebanon, referring to armed groups it supports across the region.\n\nFrom Marjayoun, Lebanon, Al Jazeera Assed Baig said Hezbollah's response to Nasser's killing included a total of ten separate attacks.\n\n\"In fact, earlier, we heard some of those missiles and rockets coming out of southern Lebanon and we saw them hitting the occupied Golan Heights. We saw smoke rising and some of them catching fire,\" he said.\n\nLebanon's National News Agency reported Israeli attacks on the southern towns of Qiyam, Aida al-Shaab and Markaba following Wednesday's killings.\n\n\"Israel is also targeting southern Lebanon, and some fear this is an escalation,\" Baig said.\n\nOn Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a \"conflict\" between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nMacron \"reiterated his serious concern about the deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel ... and underlined the absolute need to prevent a conflict that would harm the interests of Lebanon and Israel,\" the French presidential office said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, US Ambassador Amos Hochstein, who has visited Lebanon repeatedly in recent months, was also due to arrive in Paris on Wednesday to meet with Macron's Lebanese ambassador, Jean-Yves Le Trian.\n\nGallant said on Wednesday that the attacks were continuing, adding that the army \"will be fully prepared to take any necessary action in Lebanon or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength.\"\n\nShortly before he spoke, Israeli warplanes bombed several villages in southern Lebanon overnight, including Yaron, Thayer Harfa and Aidaroun.\n\nA day earlier, Hezbollah's deputy commander, Sheik Naim Qassem, said the group would stop fighting \"without any discussion\" if a complete ceasefire in Gaza was reached - a position it has maintained since the start of the war.\n\nIsraeli attacks in Lebanon have killed at least 543 people, including 88 civilians, while at least 21 Israelis, including 10 civilians, have been killed in attacks by Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon since the start of the war.\n\nAt least 37,953 people have been killed in Israel's war on Gaza since October, according to Palestinian health officials. Israel launched the offensive after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7 that killed at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera count based on Israeli figures.", "source": {"uri":

armed and long seen as a significantly superior foe to Hamas, has said it does not want a full-out war with Israel and that it will observe in Lebanon any ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"Israel can decide what it wants: limited war, total war, partial war,\" the group's deputy leader, Naim Qassem, said in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday. \"But it should expect that our response and our resistance will not be within a ceiling and rules of engagement set by Israel.\"\n\nSo far, more than 400 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters,

As the latest violence played out in areas, at, or near the frontier - in keeping with the pattern of the last nine months - the sound of sonic booms rattled nerves for the second day in a row in Beirut and more widely across Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli jets broke the sound barrier over several areas of Lebanon, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. Hezbollah said it launched more than 200 rockets and a swarm of drones at 10 Israeli military sites in retaliation for Israel's killing of Hezbollah commander Mohammed Nasser in the south on Wednesday. Nasser is one of the most senior Hezbollah commanders to be killed by Israel during the conflict.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson said Hezbollah's claims were \"under review\", while Israel's ambulance service said there were no casualties reported. The Israeli military said it was striking launch posts in southern Lebanon and that it had intercepted numerous projectiles. Some of the drones and interceptor shrapnel set off fires, it said.\n\nDIPLOMATIC PUSH The United States has been leading diplomatic efforts to deescalate the fighting. Hezbollah has said it will not cease fire as long as Israel continues its offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe hostilities have inflicted a heavy toll on both sides of the frontier, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Amos Hochstein, a senior U.S. official at the heart of the diplomacy, discussed French and American efforts to restore calm in meetings with French officials on Wednesday, a White House official said.\n\n\"France and the United States share the goal of resolving the current conflict across the Blue Line by diplomatic means, allowing Israeli and Lebanese civilians to return home with long-term assurances of safety and security,\" the official said, referring to the demarcation line between the two neighbours. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday Israeli forces were hitting Hezbollah \"very hard every day\" and will be ready to take any action necessary against the group, though the preference is to reach a negotiated arrangement.\n\nHezbollah also launched rockets at Israel on Wednesday in retaliation for Nasser's killing.

His death prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 100 rockets into Israel on Wednesday.\n\nThe attack on Thursday was one of the largest so far along the Lebanon-Israel border as tensions skyrocket with the group sending exploding drones at several military bases in northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces were \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon\" after \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory\", most of which were intercepted.\n\nIt said \"fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel\" following the attacks.\n\nIsraeli media reported a vehicle with Israeli troops inside was hit by a projectile. There were reportedly two direct strikes on two buildings, one in Acre and another north of the city. Ambulance service Magen David Adom said two women were taken to hospital in northern Israel with light injuries.\n\nSeventeen alerts were sounded over 90 minutes in different parts of the northern region, from Nahariya in the west to Golan in the east, according to the military.\n\nThe uptick in fighting and charged rhetoric between Hezbollah and Israeli officials has sent United States, European, and Arab mediators scrambling to prevent a wider regional conflagration.\n\nHezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Palestinian armed group Hamas, which attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,139 people and taking about 250 others captive.\n\nIn response, Israel launched a no-limits attack on Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 people - mostly children and women - forcibly displaced about two million others multiple times, and laid waste to the long-besieged coastal enclave.\n\nNow, as tensions with Hezbollah spike, Israeli officials say they may go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail.\n\nEstimates suggest border clashes have so far killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also 95 civilians. Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have died.\n\nRami Khouri, a political analyst from the American University of Beirut, said while Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to thump the drums of war with Hezbollah, its military is unprepared for a second front.\n\n\"Netanyahu, especially, keeps saying we are going to attack Lebanon. We are going to destroy Hezbollah. But they don't have the capacity to do that while they are still fighting a war in Gaza,\" Khouri told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe suggested a Gaza ceasefire is the best possible scenario for Israel. \"Hezbollah has said many times: 'We will stop attacking Israel if Israel stops attacking Gaza.'\"\n\nStephane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations chief Antonio Guterres, said on Wednesday he's \"very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire\" between Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nHe warned of the potential risks to the region as a whole if it were to find itself in a \"full-fledged

A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously in line with regulations, said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nNasser is the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a speech honoring Abdullah said he played a pivotal role on the front line since clashes began on Oct. 8 leading the Nasr Unit.\n\nHezbollah said in response to the killing of Nasser, it launched Falaq rockets with heavy warheads targeting the headquarters of the Israeli military's 769th Brigade in Kiryat Shmona, as well as 100 salvos of Katyusha rockets targeting the headquarters of Israel's 210th division and the Kilaa air base in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\n\nThe group also shared footage of Nasser taking part in what they said was an operation at an Israeli military outpost in southern Lebanon in 1999 back when it was under occupation.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" militants in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel in October, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nThe group maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says it will continue with its attacks to pile pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation should Hezbollah not stop its attacks.\n\nHezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that Israel cannot expect the group's attacks to remain limited should it launch a military operation within Lebanon, even if it aims to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nSenior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between Lebanon and Israel, is set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris on Wednesday as part of his ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the

Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants.

The attack by the Iran-backed militant group on Thursday was one of the largest in the monthslong conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border, per the AP. The Israeli military said \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets\" had entered its territory from Lebanon, many of which it said were intercepted. There were no immediate reports of casualties. It acknowledged on Wednesday that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours later, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases. The US and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiraling into an all-out war, which they fear could spill over across the region. The relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it's striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. The group's leadership says it will stop its attacks once there's a ceasefire in Gaza, and that while it doesn't want war, it's ready for one.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail. Hezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to US President Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris. The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians -- have been killed. Israel sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.

He was one of the highest-ranking officials in the terror group to be killed in nine months of fighting along the border. The terror group responded by firing at least 100 rockets at northern Israel on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHezbollah confirmed the death of Muhammad Nimah Nasser, also known as Abu Nimah, from the south Lebanon town of Haddatha, following reports of the strike. Nasser was killed in a strike in the coastal city of Tyre.\n\nLebanon's state-run National News Agency said \"an enemy drone targeted a car\" in Tyre, around 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border. A source told AFP that a second Hezbollah fighter and a civilian were also killed in the same strike.\n\nIn its statement, Hezbollah referred to Nasser as a commander, a designation the terror group rarely uses to refer to its senior operatives slain in Israeli strikes. The only other operatives referred to as commanders were Taleb Abdullah -- the commander of the Nasr regional division -- killed last month, and Wissam al-Tawil -- the deputy head of the terror group's elite Radwan unit -- killed by Israel in January.\n\nSeveral hours after the strike, the IDF confirmed that it had killed Nasser, who it said since 2016 commanded Hezbollah's Aziz unit, one of three regional divisions in south Lebanon. The unit is responsible for Lebanon's southwestern region, from the coast to the Bint Jbeil area, and has carried out hundreds of attacks against northern Israel's upper and western Galilee amid the war.\n\nAccording to the IDF, he is the second most senior Hezbollah commander it has killed amid the ongoing fighting alongside fellow regional division head Abdullah. Nasser previously commanded Hezbollah special forces, and was involved in numerous attacks against Israel, including the 2006 cross-border kidnapping of soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev.\n\nThe killing of Abdullah in June sparked an escalation in drone and rocket attacks from Lebanon on northern towns and IDF bases in the days following the airstrike, including a barrage of more than 80 rockets.\n\nThe IDF expected Hezbollah to also respond with major attacks to Nasser's killing. In the hours following the airstrike, at least 100 rockets were fired from Lebanon at Kiryat Shmona, other areas in the Galilee Panhandle, as well as at the northern Golan Heights, the military said.\n\nThe IDF said most of the rockets struck open areas. There were no reports of injuries.\n\nIn comments released by his office shortly after the airstrike, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israeli forces would be ready to take any action necessary against Hezbollah, although Israel would still prefer to reach a negotiated deal.\n\nSpeaking to troops along the Gaza border, Gallant said that IDF tanks exiting Rafah \"can reach as far as the Litani\" -- a reference to a Lebanon river 10 miles north of Israel's border, and the line to which Israel is demanding the terror group withdraw its forces.\n\n\"We are striking Hezbollah very hard every day, and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength,\" Gallant said in a statement from his office. \"We prefer an arrangement, but if reality forces us we will know how to fight.\"\n\nOngoing diplomatic efforts by Israeli allies to prevent an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah have intensified in recent days amid fears of a wider escalation.\n\nOn Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a \"conflagration\" between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nMacron \"reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel,\" the French presidency said in a statement.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made repeated visits to Lebanon in recent months, was due in Paris on Wednesday where he was set to meet with Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nSince October 8, Hezbollah-led forces have attacked Israeli communities and military posts along the border on a near-daily basis. So far, the skirmishes on the border have resulted in 10 civilian deaths on the Israeli side, as well as the deaths of 15 IDF soldiers and reservists.\n\nHezbollah has named 358 members who have been killed by Israel during the ongoing skirmishes, mostly in Lebanon but some also in Syria. In Lebanon, another 65 operatives from other terror groups, a Lebanese soldier, and around 95 civilians have been killed.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

No casualties were reported immediately.\n\nThe Lebanese Hezbollah group, on Thursday, said it launched over 200 rockets at several military bases in Israel in retaliation for a strike that killed one of its senior commanders. The attack by the Iran-backed militant group on Thursday was one of the largest in the monthslong conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border, with tensions boiling in recent weeks. The Israeli military said \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets\" had entered its territory from Lebanon, many of which it said were intercepted. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt acknowledged on Wednesday that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier. Hours later, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nThe US and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiralling into an all-out war, which they fear could spill over across the region. The relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its October 7 attack into southern Israel. The group's leadership says it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and that while it does not want war, it is ready for one.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail. Hezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to US President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris. The fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians -- have been killed.\n\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles. In 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war that ended in a draw.\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajit_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Ajit Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanese Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Yves_Le_Drian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Yves Le Drian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision-guided_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precision-guided munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/palestinians-search-for-bodies-and-survivors-in-the-rubble-of-a-residential-building-destroyed-in-an-israeli-airstrike-in-khan-younis-1720089333.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1564, "textEnd": 1573}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" militants in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel in October, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nThe group maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says it will continue with its attacks to pile pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation should Hezbollah not stop its attacks.\n\nHezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that Israel cannot expect the group's attacks to remain limited should it launch a military operation within Lebanon, even if it aims to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nSenior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between Lebanon and Israel, is set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris on Wednesday as part of his ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.\n\nFrench officials had invited Hochstein to the French capital to discuss the latest developments in their ongoing diplomatic scrambles, according to administration officials who spoke on

His death prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 100 rockets into Israel on Wednesday.\n\nNasser, also known as Hajj Abu Nimah, was the third high-ranking Hezbollah fighter killed in almost nine months of cross-border fighting sparked by the Israeli war in Gaza.\n\nReuters cited the Israeli military as giving a similar assessment of the scale of the attack, stating that \"200 projectiles and over 20 suspicious aerial targets were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,\" a number of which were intercepted by Israeli air defenses and fighter jets. No casualties were reported.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that the country's forces were hitting Hezbollah \"very hard every day\" and will be ready to take any action necessary against the group. However, Israel's preference is reportedly to reach a negotiated arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile, senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine has warned that the group would increase its strikes against Israel.\n\n\"The series of responses continues in succession, and this series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit,\" Safieddine said at an event in Beirut commemorating the killed commander.\n\nThe growing tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been causing concern of an escalation into an all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Israeli attacks in Lebanon have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and some 90 civilians. Israel reportedly said that strikes from Lebanon have killed 18 soldiers and 10 civilians.\n\nHezbollah's deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told AP this week that the only way to stop the escalation on the Israeli-Lebanese border is for West Jerusalem to end its operation in Gaza. Hezbollah has been claiming to be striking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian armed group Hamas.\n\nWest Jerusalem declared war on Hamas after the militant group launched a surprise attack in the south of the country last October, leaving more than 1,200 people dead and taking over 200 hostages.

Hezbollah added that its fighters also fired \"more than 200 rockets of various types\" at several Israeli bases across the border. The attack on Thursday was one of the largest in the months-long conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border, with tensions boiling in recent weeks. In response, the Israeli military said its forces were \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon\" after \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory,\" many of which it said were intercepted. Israel said about 160 \"projectiles\" were launched towards the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and over 15 drones into Israel, but that it had intercepted some of them. The military added that \"fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel\" following the attacks. A number of residents who live closest to the flames were asked to evacuate their homes, according to Israeli media. Channel 12 news reported that 18 teams of firefighters are working on the scene. The Israeli army does not immediately provide information on potential casualties in the attacks. However, Israeli sources reported that a soldier was killed and others were injured, one of whom was in critical condition, following a bombing that targeted their vehicle on the outskirts of Golan. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that one Israeli drone strike in the border town of Houla killed at least one person. Meanwhile, Israeli jets broke the sound barrier over the Lebanese capital and other areas in the country. Israel on Wednesday acknowledged that it had killed Mohamed Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier. Hours after the killing, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the war on Gaza erupted on 7 October, stoking fears that the clashes could escalate into a new all-out war. The border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally. Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians were killed. All-out war The US and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiralling into an all-out war, which they fear could spill over across the region. Washington, in its shuttle diplomatic efforts, initially hoped for calm along the Lebanon-Israel border in a deal that is not linked to the war in Gaza. However, the US said that an end to the war in Gaza would lead to calm in Lebanon and northern Israel as well. Israel sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles. In 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war that ended in a draw.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sound barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision-guided_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precision-guided munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2024/7/4/41_2024-638556941938711983-871.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2298, "textEnd": 2307}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Cross-border exchanges of fire have intensified, and Israeli officials have publicly spoken of shifting their military focus from Hamas in the Gaza Strip to Hezbollah, a far more advanced and potent threat.\n\nAmos Hochstein, a senior White House adviser who has become the de facto U.S. envoy in tamping down the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, conferred on Wednesday with French officials in Paris to discuss how to defuse the rising tensions. Jean-Yves Le Drian, President Emmanuel Macron's special envoy to Lebanon, was among the people with whom he met, according to a person close to the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.\n\nThe Israeli military said its drone strike had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, also known as Abu Naameh, who was among the highest-ranking Hezbollah fighters to die in nearly nine months of conflict, according to a senior Lebanese intelligence official, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue. He said Nasser had led Hezbollah's Aziz unit, one of the group's main fighting forces along the Lebanese border.\n\nHezbollah confirmed his death, and though it did not explicitly say how he had died, the group said it had fired 100 rockets at military targets over the border as part of an \"initial response,\" setting off sirens in communities across northern Israel. The Israeli military said that most of that barrage had fallen in open areas, but Hezbollah continued to claim retaliatory attacks into the evening.\n\nIn solidarity with Hamas, Hezbollah, which is closely tied to Iran, has greatly increased the pace of its periodic attacks on northern Israel since the war in Gaza began in October. Israel has retaliated with strikes in Lebanon.\n\nThe killing of Naameh in a drone strike in the Tyre area on the western coast was the latest in a string of Israeli assassinations of Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon. One last month led to an escalation in the fighting that the Biden administration has since struggled to contain. With tensions already high, analysts and Western diplomats have warned that the tit-for-tat strikes could lead to further escalation.\n\nAmal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University who researches Hezbollah, said that the powerful militia would not allow itself to be dragged into an all-out war over the killing, but that recent threats by Israeli officials would not deter Hezbollah from responding with strength.\n\n\"I don't think Hezbollah will downplay this,\" Saad said, adding that the rocket barrage was only \"a small teaser of what is to come.\"\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has so far remained fairly contained, but the fighting has already displaced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the border. If a full-scale war were to break out, analysts said, it would very likely prove catastrophic, leaving swaths of Lebanon in ruins, prompting Hezbollah to unleash its arsenal of precision-guided missiles on cities across Israel, and potentially setting off a wider regional war involving Iran. Israel's military leadership is seeking a cease-fire with Hamas in case a larger war breaks out in Lebanon, according to Israeli security officials.\n\nU.S. officials have worked for months to prevent a war between Israel and Hezbollah. On Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel \"has effectively lost sovereignty\" near the border with Lebanon because Hezbollah attacks launched from across the border had driven much of the population from their homes. Some 60,000 Israelis have fled the area, many of whom have been living in Tel Aviv hotels for the past nine months.\n\nIn his remarks Monday, Blinken noted that Hezbollah had said that if a cease-fire were reached in Gaza, it would stop firing into Israel. That \"underscores why a cease-fire in Gaza is so critical,\" he said.\n\nThe cease-fire talks have been deadlocked since June, but officials said Wednesday that mediators were working to revive them, focusing on terms based on a proposal backed by the United Nations and the United States.\n\nFor months, Israel and Hamas, which do not talk directly with each other, have negotiated through mediators, including Qatar and Egypt, over a potential deal for a three-stage truce in Gaza and the release of the remaining 120 living and dead hostages held there. However, wide gaps remained on key issues.\n\nLast week, Qatar sent Hamas new potential amendments to the proposed deal in an effort to win over its support, according to two senior officials from different countries involved in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks.\n\nThe main stumbling blocks remain: Hamas, which controlled Gaza before the conflict, wants an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed and seeks control over postwar security in Gaza.\n\nCurrent and former security officials in Israel say the country's top generals want to start a cease-fire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being. Israel's generals see their forces being stretched thin, in both soldiers and munitions, as the war drags on. They believe the military needs time to recuperate in case a ground war with Hezbollah breaks out, the officials said.\n\nIsrael's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said Wednesday that Israeli forces were prepared to take any action necessary against Hezbollah, but that they preferred a diplomatic settlement.\n\n\"We are striking Hezbollah very hard every day and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength,\" said Gallant, according to a statement from his office.\n\n\"We prefer an arrangement, but if reality forces us we will know how to fight,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Israeli military said a number of projectiles which fell in open areas sparked fires, but no injuries were reported.\n\nThe military said Nasser commanded Hezbollah's Aziz Unit, which is responsible for launching rockets from south-western Lebanon, and accused him of directing a \"large number of terror attacks\".\n\nIt also described him as \"the counterpart\" of Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of another unit whose killing last month prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 200 rockets and missiles into northern Israel in a single day.\n\nSince then, there has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, with the UN and US warning of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a war that could also draw in Iran and other allied groups.\n\nThere have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October.\n\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran. Both groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\n\nIn recent weeks, Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they will use military force to restore security along the northern border if diplomacy fails.\n\n\"We are striking Hezbollah very hard every day and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength,\" Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday. \"We prefer an arrangement, but if reality forces us we will know how to fight.\"\n\nHezbollah, heavily armed and long seen as a significantly superior foe to Hamas, has said it does not want a full-out war with Israel and that it will observe in Lebanon any ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"Israel can decide what it wants: limited war, total war, partial war,\" the group's deputy leader, Naim Qassem, said in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday. \"But it should expect that our response and our resistance will not be within a ceiling and rules of engagement set by Israel.\"\n\nSo far, more than 400 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, and 25 people in Israel, mostly soldiers.\n\nTens of thousands from communities on both sides of the border have also been displaced.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

In response to Hezbollah's rocket barrage, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned of a potential ground offensive deep into Lebanon if the attacks persisted.\n\nThe tanks \"coming out of the battle in Rafah can reach as far as the Litani,\" Gallant remarked during a visit near the Gaza Strip border. The Litani is Lebanon's longest river that stretches from the country's center to its south.\n\nDespite expressing a preference for a ceasefire, Gallant emphasized Israel's readiness for military action. Hezbollah, for its part, previously said it would stop its attacks once Israel agrees to a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nTensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on Oct. 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Most of them fell in open areas outside the communities, and one rocket was successfully intercepted by the Iron Dome,\" the Council reported. \"One of the rockets fell in the area of Kibbutz Holit's fence.\"\n\nThe Eshkol Regional Council includes territory stretching from the border with Egypt and Gaza to north of Kibbutz Be'eri.\n\nThe rocket attack caused no injuries, and the IDF said it responded with artillery fire, striking the sources of the launches.\n\nEarlier, the rockets triggered sirens in the Israeli communities in the area.\n\nThese sirens first blared in Nir Oz and Ein Hashlosha at 7:57 a.m. local time before being triggered several more times in various communities, including Ein Hashlosha.\n\nIn Shejaia in northern Gaza, the IDF continued a second invasion of the area, which it started this past Friday, having taken control of the area back in January but then leaving it shortly after.\n\nIDF Division 98 carried out a number of raids and found significant quantities of Hamas weapons.\n\nThe military also noted that the Israel Air Force (IAF) struck many targets, eliminating about 20 terrorists and demolishing manufacturing facilities and warehouses.\n\nIn Rafah, forces of the Nahal Brigade, under the command of the 162nd Division, identified a terrorist who launched an anti-tank missile toward them. He was subsequently struck by an IAF aircraft.\n\nSergeant Ori Itzchak Hadad, 21, from Beersheba, from the 931st Battalion of the Nahal Brigade, fell in combat in the southern Gaza Strip, the military said on Monday.\n\nAnother soldier from the Nahal Brigade sustained severe injuries during the incident in which Hadad fell He was evacuated to a hospital for medical treatment.\n\nSeparately, the IDF added that on Sunday, in central Gaza, troops of the 99th Division identified a terrorist who had fired a mortar at them. An IAF aircraft eliminated him, the IDF noted. There were no injuries to IDF forces during that incident.\n\nIDF in the West Bank\n\nIN THE West Bank, a military vehicle drove over an explosive device in the Nur Shams camp in the Palestinian city of Tulkarm. The incident occurred during IDF operations in the area, during which the forces were reportedly targeted by more explosives.\n\nThe IDF had not disclosed what had happened to the soldiers by press time.\n\nLater, the Palestinian Health Ministry, based in Ramallah, stated that a \"child\" and woman had been killed.\n\nAn additional four people were reportedly wounded by Israeli fire.\n\nThe ministry did not comment on the age of the child or whether those reportedly killed or wounded were engaged in attacks on the Israeli personnel operating in the area.\n\nAttacks and counterattacks in the North\n\nIn the North, the IDF and Hezbollah continued a pattern of significant but contained attacks and counterattacks.Following alarms in Ma'ayan Baruch at 5:31 p.m. Monday, five Hezbollah rockets crossed into the Galilee from Lebanon and fell in open areas; no casualties were reported, the IDF announced Monday evening.\n\nAdditionally, after alarms were activated in Ramot Naftali at 4:23 p.m. and in Dovev at 5:03 p.m., a Hezbollah rocket crossed into Israel from Lebanon and fell into an open area. Again, no casualties were reported.\n\nAdditionally, a mortar made a direct hit on a house in Metulla on Monday afternoon. For unexplained reasons, no siren was activated in the area. However, there were no reports of damage or casualties.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Israeli Air Force fighter jets attacked two Hezbollah military buildings, where terrorists were operating in the areas of Aitaroun and Ayta ash Shab in southern Lebanon, as well as military buildings and terrorist infrastructure in the areas of Markaba, Houla, and Kfarkela in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe air force also attacked a Hezbollah military building in the Blida area of southern Lebanon when some Hezbollah terrorists entered, the military said on Monday.\n\nEarlier on Monday, the military said its jets had struck other Hezbollah military targets in southern Lebanon overnight, including military structures in the Kfarkela area and terror infrastructure in the Houla, El Biyada, and Rab El Thalathine areas.\n\nIn addition, the military noted that IDF artillery forces fired at the Al-Dahira area to remove a threat.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"},

In response, the group fired dozens of rockets at Israeli military positions.\n\nThe Lebanese armed group on Wednesday said that Muhammad Nimah Nasser, also known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\", had been killed. The Iran-aligned group later added it had launched 100 katyusha rockets targeting Israeli military positions.\n\nThe announcement of Nasser's death on the group's Telegram did not provide the location, but a source previously told Al Jazeera that a commander had been killed in the Hosh area in Tyre in southern Lebanon. A source close to the group confirmed to the AFP news agency that Nasser had been killed in the Tyre attack.\n\nThe source stated that Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, another top commander who was killed by an Israeli attack in June. At the time, Abdallah was the highest-ranking Hezbollah military official killed since the group began fighting Israel on October 8 in response to bombardment of Gaza. Following Abdallah's killing, Hezbollah launched one of its largest rocket barrages on northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed it targeted Nasser, and noted he was a \"counterpart\" of Abdallah and in charge of Hezbollah's \"antitank and rocket fire from southwest Lebanon\". In January, an Israeli strike also killed Wissam al-Tawil, another top commander from the group.\n\nThe latest attacks come amid an uptick in fighting and charged rhetoric between Hezbollah and Israeli officials that has sent US, European, and Arab mediators scrambling to prevent a wider regional escalation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in late June that Israeli forces must shift their focus to northern Israel, while far-right Israeli ministers called for a full-scale invasion of territory controlled by Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant has said Israel is seeking to prevent a wider war, but warned that its military has the capacity to take \"Lebanon back to the Stone Age\".\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group was ready for war with \"no restraint and no rules and no ceilings\" in the event of a major Israeli attack.\n\nFor its part, Iran has warned that \"all Resistance Fronts\" would confront Israel if it attacks Lebanon, referring to the armed groups it supports throughout the region.\n\nAt least 543 people, including 88 civilians, have been killed by Israeli attacks in Lebanon, while at least 21 Israelis, including 10 civilians, have been killed in attacks by Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon since the beginning of the war.\n\nAt least 37,953 people have been killed in Israel's war on Gaza since October, according to Palestinian health authorities.", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

positions on Thursday, vowing to intensify its attacks after the killing of a senior commander a day earlier. as tensions have soared amid the almost nine-months-old war raging in Gaza.\n\nThe Iran-backed militant group said its latest attack, which followed the launch of over 100 rockets on Wednesday, came in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, near the southern Lebanese coastal city of Tyre.\n\nA source close to the group described him as the \"Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon.\" Another border sector chief was killed in an Israeli strike last month.\n\nThe Israeli military said Thursday its forces were \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon\" after \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory\".\n\nIt said that most were intercepted by air defence systems but that \"fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel\" following the attacks.\n\nIsrael did not report any deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with strikes on targets in southern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy\" it had fired \"more than 200 rockets\" and \"a squadron of explosive drones\" at Israeli bases.\n\nAir raid sirens blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted.\n\nSenior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine threatened to attack new locations within Israel as part of the group's response to the killing of Nasser.\n\n\"The series of responses continues in succession, and this series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit,\" Safieddine said, speaking at the senior commander's memorial on Thursday.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears the clashes could escalate into all-out war.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres is \"very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire\", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday, warning of the risk to the wider Middle East \"if we were to find ourselves in a full-fledged conflict\".\n\nHezbollah and Hamas are part of an Iran-led \"Axis of Resistance\" against Israel and the United States, a regional alliance that also includes Yemen's Houthi rebels and militias in

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt acknowledged on Wednesday that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours later, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said that the Palestinian death toll from nearly nine months of war has surged past 38,000, in what Israel has been forced to deny to a UN court is genocide.\n\nThe ministry said that in the last 24 hours, the bodies of 58 people had been brought to hospitals, bringing the overall death toll to 38,011.\n\nIt said more than 87,000 people have been wounded in the fighting.\n\nThe ministry does not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants in its count, but many of the dead are said to be women and children.\n\nThe US and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes involving Hezbollah from spiralling into an all-out war, which they fear could spill over across the Arab world.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its October 7 attack into southern Israel.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.\n\nIn Lebanon, more than 450 people - mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians - have been killed.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail.\n\nHezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to US President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris.\n\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.\n\nIn 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war that ended in stalemate.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's cabinet is set to convene to discuss Hamas' latest response to the US-backed proposal for a phased ceasefire in Gaza, as diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the nine-month war stirred back to life.\n\nThe US has rallied world support behind a plan that would see the release of all of the scores of hostages still held by the militant group in return for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But until now, neither side appears to have fully embraced it.\n\nHamas suggested \"amendments\" last month, some of which the US said were unworkable, without providing specifics. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed that the original proposal was an Israeli one, but has raised doubts over whether it would end the war - a key Hamas demand.\n\nHamas confirmed on Wednesday that it had sent another response to Egypt and Qatar, which are mediating the talks, without providing details.

It also saw more than 20 \"suspicious aerial targets,\" several of which were intercepted, launched at Israel.\n\nThe slain IDF soldier, hit by a rocket in Golan Heights, was identified as Maj. Res. Itay Galea, 38.\n\nFires erupted in several areas and there were original reports of several injuries on the Israeli side, according to The Jerusalem Post.\n\nSirens in a handful of northern Israeli towns were heard in the morning hours as the Lebanese-based terror group fired at cites like Acre and Nahariya, which have typically not been targets, in what has been described as one of the most intensive attacks by Hezbollah on neighboring Israel since the October war with Hamas began.\n\nIn response, the IDF says it carried out a series of airstrikes at supposed Hezbollah launch posts at Ramyeh, Houla, Shihine and southern Lebanon's Jabal Blat area.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, Hezbollah launched toward the Golan area, some of which were intercepted by IDF's Aerial Defense Array and Israeli Air Force responders.\n\nThis arrives as the Gaza-run Health Ministry claims of now more than 38,000 dead since Hamas attacked Israel and 87,445 injured.\n\nThe Israeli military and Hezbollah have been engaged in daily fighting, mostly restricted to parts of southern Lebanon and northern Israel, since the Lebanese militant group joined the battle a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 sneak attack on Israel sparked the war in the Gaza Strip in southern Israel.\n\nBut Israel was bracing for the strikes, a direct response to Wednesday's killing of Muhammad Nimah Nasser, a second most senior Hezbollah commander who was killed in IDF military strikes in the coastal city of Tyre, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nHezbollah then responded in kind by firing at least 100 rockets to Israel's north by Wednesday afternoon local time.\n\nThe United States recently deployed an amphibious assault ship to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, intended to act as a military deterrent, in a show of force as tensions mount along the Lebanese border.\n\nHowever, Iran's proxy militia is not willing to go into a full-scale war with Israel, preferring to maintain the status quo of a \"gray-zone warfare,\" analysts told UPI in January.\n\nA Shiite Muslim political party and militant group based in Lebanon, Hezbollah has \"an extensive security apparatus,\" political organization and social services network which has fostered its reputation as a 'state within a state,'\" the Council on Foreign Relations explains.\n\nFounded in the chaos of the 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War, the Iran-backed Hezbollah, similar to Hamas, is \"driven by its opposition to Israel and its resistance to Western influence in the Middle East.\"\n\nAnother top Hezbollah official has signaled how attacks are likely to keep intensifying.\n\nLast week, Israel struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in response to Hezbollah's recent airstrikes from southern Lebanon toward Kibbutz Misgav Am along the Israeli-Lebanese border. No injuries were reported at the time.\n\n\"The series of responses continues in succession, and this series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit,\" Hashem

The incident escalated tensions amid efforts by Western diplomats to prevent a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah. Cross-border exchanges intensified as Israeli officials discussed shifting military focus from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah, seen as a more formidable threat. The conflict has displaced over 150,000 people, with fears that further escalation could lead to widespread devastation and regional conflict involving Iran.Israeli forces killed a senior Hezbollah commander on Wednesday in a drone strike in southern Lebanon, prompting the Lebanese militia to retaliate with a heavy rocket barrage across the border.\n\nThe flare-up came as Western diplomats worked to avoid a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, a danger that appears to have grown in recent weeks. Cross-border exchanges of fire have intensified, and Israeli officials have publicly spoken of shifting their military focus from Hamas in the Gaza Strip to Hezbollah, a far more advanced and potent threat.\n\nAmos Hochstein, a senior White House adviser who has become the de facto U.S. envoy in tamping down the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, conferred on Wednesday with French officials in Paris to discuss how to defuse the rising tensions. Jean-Yves Le Drian, President Emmanuel Macron's special envoy to Lebanon, was among the people with whom he met, according to a person close to the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.\n\nThe Israeli military said its drone strike had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, also known as Abu Naameh, who was among the highest-ranking Hezbollah fighters to die in nearly nine months of conflict, according to a senior Lebanese intelligence official, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue. He said Nasser had led Hezbollah's Aziz unit, one of the group's main fighting forces along the Lebanese border.\n\nHezbollah confirmed his death, and though it did not explicitly say how he had died, the group said it had fired 100 rockets at military targets over the border as part of an \"initial response,\" setting off sirens in communities across northern Israel. The Israeli military said that most of that barrage had fallen in open areas, but Hezbollah continued to claim retaliatory attacks into the evening.\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has so far remained fairly contained, but the fighting has already displaced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the border. If a full-scale war were to break out, analysts said, it would very likely prove catastrophic, leaving swaths of Lebanon in ruins, prompting\n\nHezbollah to unleash its arsenal of precision-guided missiles on cities across Israel, and potentially setting off a wider regional war involving Iran.

In a separate statement late Wednesday, Hezbollah said it had fired over 100 rockets at bases near Israel's northern border.\n\nBoth attacks came after the group confirmed that Muhammad Na'ima Nasser, one its senior field commanders, had been killed in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre.\n\nThe Israeli military later confirmed that they \"struck and eliminated\" Nasser, who was also known as Hajj Abu Na'ima, in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe statement said he was a commander with Hezbollah's Aziz Unit, \"responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon at Israeli territory.\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces also accused Nasser of directing \"a large number of terror attacks\" toward Israel, both during and before the start of the war with Hamas in Gaza. It did not say where or how Nasser was killed.\n\nAfter the first wave of Hezbollah attacks on Wednesday, the IDF said some of the projectiles were intercepted and some fell in the area of Kiryat Shmona, a city near the Lebanese border, but the majority of the launches fell in open areas. It added that its forces struck a Hezbollah launcher that was used to fire the barrages.\n\nMagen David Adom, the Israeli counterpart of the American Red Cross, said there were no casualties reported. It is unclear if anyone was killed or injured in the second wave of strikes.\n\nThe day after Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, Hezbollah announced its solidarity with the group -- which is also backed by Iran -- and began a near-daily barrage of missile and rocket attacks over Israel's southern border.\n\nThe fighting has ratcheted up in recent weeks with Hezbollah using increasingly sophisticated weapons to fire far deeper into Israel. After another of its senior commanders, Taleb Abdallah, was killed last month, the group fired a large barrages of drones and rockets at Israel.\n\nThe IDF said Wednesday Nasser and Abdallah \"served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon.\"\n\nIsrael has been firing back with greater frequency, and its leadership has become increasingly bellicose, threatening to invade Lebanon and take Hezbollah head-on.\n\nIt has also evacuated about 60,000 people from more than 40 northern communities. On the Lebanese side, the fighting has displaced around 74,500 people, according to the International Organization for Migration.\n\nThe tit-for-tat attacks come as fears grow that the conflict could escalate into a wider confrontation on Israel's northern border, as the war in Gaza continues to rage on more than eight months after Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks that saw 1,200 people killed and resulted in around 250 taken hostage. Nearly 38,000 have been killed in Gaza in the offensive that followed, health officials in the enclave have said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his security cabinet on Thursday evening to discuss new Hamas positions on a cease-fire deal in Gaza, an Israeli official confirmed to NBC News Thursday.\n\nIsrael received Hamas' response on Wednesday to a proposal made public at the end of May by President Joe Biden that would include the release of about 120 hostages remaining in Gaza in addition to a cease-fire.\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Hamas said Ismail Haniyeh, the head of its political bureau, spoke with mediators in Qatar, Egypt and Turkey about reaching a deal to end the war. \"The movement dealt in a positive spirit with the content of the ongoing deliberations,\" it said.\n\nBoth sides have struggled to arrive at a long-term agreement to end the bloodshed as Netanyahu has vowed the war would continue until Hamas is completely obliterated.\n\nHowever, he said last month the \"intensive\" phase of Israel's offensive in Gaza would end soon, and that would allow a shift in focus to the simmering conflict on the country's northern border with Lebanon.\n\nHamas meanwhile, has said it won't stop fighting until there is a permanent cease-fire in place and Israel fully withdraws from Gaza.", "source": {"uri":

-", "body": "Hezbollah says a top commander has been killed in an Israeli attack in southern Lebanon, at least the third high-ranking official in the group to be killed in almost nine months of cross-border fighting that has sparked fears of wider regional escalation.\n\nThe Lebanese armed group on Wednesday said that Muhammad Nimah Nasser, also known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\", had been killed.\n\nThe Iran-aligned group later said it had launched 100 katyusha rockets targeting Israeli military positions.\n\nThe announcement of Nasser's death on the group's Telegram did not provide the location, but a source previously told Al Jazeera that a commander had been killed in the Hosh area in Tyre in southern Lebanon.\n\nA source close to the group confirmed to the AFP news agency that Nasser had been killed in the Tyre attack.\n\nThe source said that Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, another top commander who was killed by an Israeli attack in June.\n\nAt the time, Abdallah was the highest-ranking Hezbollah military official killed since the group began fighting Israel on October 8 in response to bombardment of Gaza.\n\nFollowing Abdallah's killing, Hezbollah launched one of its largest rocket barrages on northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed it targeted Nasser, and said he was a \"counterpart\" of Abdallah and in charge of Hezbollah's \"antitank and rocket fire from southwest Lebanon\".\n\nIn January, an Israeli strike also killed Wissam al-Tawil, another top commander from the group.\n\nThe latest attacks come amid an uptick in fighting and charged rhetoric between Hezbollah and Israeli officials that has sent US, European, and Arab mediators scrambling to prevent a wider regional escalation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in late June that Israeli forces must shift their focus to northern Israel, while far-right Israeli ministers called for a full-scale invasion of territory controlled by Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant has said Israel is seeking to prevent a wider war, but warned that its military has the capacity to take \"Lebanon back to the Stone Age\".\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group was ready for war with \"no restraint and no rules and no ceilings\" in the event of a major Israeli attack.\n\nFor its part, Iran has warned that \"all Resistance Fronts\" would confront Israel if it attacks Lebanon, referring to the armed groups it supports throughout the region.\n\nReporting from Marjayoun, Lebanon, Al Jazeera Assed Baig said Hezbollah's response to Nasser's killing included a total of ten separate attacks.\n\nLebanon's National News Agency also reported Israeli attacks on the southern towns of Khiam, Aita al-Shaab

One struck the northern border town of Metula, the military said.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries, with Metula having largely been evacuated. According to Hebrew media reports, the rocket hit an unoccupied home, with no sirens activated to warn of the attack.\n\nRocket sirens were also heard in the town of Kiryat Shmona and at least seven rockets hit areas in the north during the afternoon. Five rockets were fired at the northern community of Maayan Baruch, setting off sirens. The IDF said the rockets struck open areas, causing no injuries.\n\nEarlier, one rocket was fired at Dovev, setting off a siren there and another was fired at Ramot Naftali, setting off sirens. According to the IDF, both rockets struck open areas, causing no injuries.\n\nThe IDF announced a series of strikes in southern Lebanon throughout the day, including on buildings in Aitaroun and Ayta ash-Shab where Hezbollah operatives were gathered. Fighter jets also bombed additional buildings the army said was used by the terror group and other Hezbollah infrastructure in Markaba, Houla and Kafr Kila.\n\nIn the morning, the IDF said it carried out an airstrike against a group of Hezbollah operatives spotted entering a building used by the terror group in southern Lebanon's Blida.\n\nThe Hezbollah members were identified by artillery forces of the 91st \"Galilee\" Regional Division, and a short while later, a fighter jet struck the building, the IDF said.\n\nIn missions overnight, the IDF said it struck other Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. The targets included buildings used by the terror group in Kafr Kila and other infrastructure in Houla, Biyyada, and Rab al-Thalathine, according to the military.\n\nIn a statement Monday evening, Hezbollah declared the death of a member killed \"on the road to Jerusalem,\" its term for operatives killed in Israeli strikes. He was named as Hamza Shour, from the coastal city of Tyre.\n\nLebanon to 'soon enough start feeling' war\n\nWhile IDF operations have focused on Hezbollah, Gantz warned the European ambassadors that the Lebanese state could be in the crosshairs if it doesn't stop the terror organization's attacks.\n\n\"There is a state over there and it has a government,\" said Gantz at briefing organized by ELNET, the European Leadership Network, \"and it cannot hold the stick from both sides unless it wants to break it on its own knee.\"\n\n\"If we have to break it, then we'll do so,\" continued the National Unity party leader and former IDF chief of staff. \"So far Lebanon has not paid the price of this war, and soon enough they are going to start feeling it. They need to make sure Hezbollah stops. Hezbollah needs to decide whether it's an Iranian branch or a Lebanese organization and pay the price for what comes with this.\"\n\nAmid policy clashes with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Gantz last month pulled his party out of the emergency government his party joined following Hamas's devastating October 7 attack, which sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip and the cross-border skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nGantz told the ambassadors that Israel cannot allow Hezbollah to be in a position to carry out an attack similar to the Hamas-led onslaught, during which 3,000 Palestinian terrorists burst into southern Israel from Gaza and killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while taking 251 as hostages.\n\nHe blamed Iran, which also backs Hamas, as the \"cornerstone of all these matters and the regional instability.\n\nGantz's remarks came after the Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, a group of militia factions, vowed to increase attacks on Israel if tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon escalate into all-out war, the Al Mayadeen outlet reported Sunday.\n\nThe pro-Hezbollah Lebanese outlet also said that the committee threatened Washington, saying that in the case of war between Israel and Hezbollah, US interests in Iraq and across the Middle East would become a legitimate target.\n\nIran-backed militias in Iraq have claimed a number of drone attacks on the southern city of Eilat in the last several months.\n\nHezbollah has also increasingly used drones, with several launched Sunday from Lebanon at Israel. The IDF said that one explosive-laden drone struck the Merom Golan area, injuring 18 troops. One of the soldiers was seriously wounded, and the rest were listed in good condition.\n\nThe terror group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it targeted an Israeli military site in the area in response to IDF strikes against it earlier in the day.\n\n'Effectively lost sovereignty'\n\nAlso Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel \"has effectively lost sovereignty in the northern quadrant of its country because people don't feel safe to go to their homes.\"\n\nIn an on-stage interview at the Brookings Institution, Blinken reiterated his belief that Israel does not want a war in Lebanon, but admitted \"they may well be prepared to engage in one if necessary -- from their perspective -- to protect their interests.\"\n\nAccording to Blinken, neither Hezbollah or Lebanon want a war that would engulf the latter, nor does Iran because it would prefer to save the terror group for a scenario in which it has a direct conflict with Israel.\n\n\"On the one hand, no one actually wants a war. On the other hand, you have momentum that may be leading in that direction in which we are determined to try to arrest,\" Blinken said.\n\nHe asserted that the US has been working tirelessly to broker an agreement that would include \"making sure that forces... are pulled back so that they can't endanger people every single day\" -- an apparent recognition of Israel's demand that Hezbollah retreat north of the Litani River, 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the border.\n\nBlinken also argued that securing a ceasefire in Gaza was the best way to end attacks by both Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels.\n\nSo far, the skirmishes on the northern border have resulted in 10 civilian deaths on the Israeli side, as well as the deaths of 15 IDF soldiers and reservists. There have also been several attacks from Syria, without any injuries.\n\nHezbollah has named 357 members who have been killed by Israel during the ongoing skirmishes, mostly in Lebanon but some also in Syria. In Lebanon, another 65 operatives from other terror groups, a Lebanese soldier, and dozens of civilians have been killed.\n\nIsrael has warned that it can no longer tolerate Hezbollah's presence along its border, with tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from their homes in the north due to the rocket and drone attacks, and has warned that, should a diplomatic solution not be reached, it will

Barrage Targets Israel following Commander's Assassination", "body": "Agence France Presse cited an Israeli military spokesperson as saying that about 100 rocket launches had been made toward Israel from Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah confirmed in a statement that \"as part of the response to the attack and assassination that the enemy carried out\" in Tyre, its fighters attacked two positions in the Israeli-annexed Syrian Golan Heights \"with 100 Katyusha rockets\".\n\nThe group also claimed another retaliatory attack with Falaq rockets on a base in northern Israel.\n\nSince the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, on October 7, the Lebanese movement Hezbollah has engaged directly, but relatively in a limited way in the war against the Israeli occupation.\n\nHowever, recently, heightened tensions have raised fears of a full-scale war.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike targeted on Wednesday a car in the Hawsh area near Tyre in southern Lebanon, resulting in the assassination of a prominent Hezbollah military commander.\n\nThe target was identified as Mohammed Ni'ma Nasser, commander of Hezbollah's Aziz unit and a leader of one of the party's three axes in southern Lebanon.\n\nThis is the second high-profile assassination since June 11, when Taleb Abdullah, another leader of one of the three axes in southern Lebanon, was killed in an airstrike in Joya, about 15 kilometers from the Israeli border, along with three other party members.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement that \"with great pride and honor, the Islamic Resistance exalts the martyr leader fighter Mohammed Ni'ma Nasser 'Al-Hajj Abu Ni'ma' born in 1965 from the town of Hadada in southern Lebanon, who rose as a martyr on the road to Al-Quds.\"\n\nThe ground developments come as Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, condemned the Israeli attacks on Lebanon as \"destructive and terrorist aggression\" and called for international intervention.\n\nMikati stated that the events in southern Lebanon are a result of Israel's continued attacks on Lebanon's sovereignty and violations of international resolution 1701, which demands both parties cease their attacks and for Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.\n\nMikati also warned of the risk of the Gaza conflict spreading to Lebanon and the wider region, emphasizing Lebanon's commitment to peace based on justice and international law.\n\nIn a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the importance of preventing an escalation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, warning that it would endanger regional stability and harm both Lebanon and Israel.\n\nIn contrast, Iranian Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires Ali Bagheri Kani warned that Lebanon would become a \"hell with no return\" for Israelis, also suggesting that Israel is trying to offset its losses from the Gaza conflict.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the US envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, plans to meet with French officials in Paris to discuss de-escalation strategies along the Hezbollah-Israel border.\n\nAccording to Hezbollah sources, the movement has carried out 1,194 military operations in the first 250 days of war, killing and wounding over 2,000 Israeli soldiers.\n\nIsrael has occupied parts of Lebanon for decades and has only left the country in 2000, following stiff Lebanese resistance under Hezbollah's leadership.\n\nIt attempted to re-occupy Lebanon in 2006 but failed in what Lebanon considers a major victory against Israel.\n\nIsrael, however, continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, namely the Sheeba Farms region.", "source": {"uri": "palestinechronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palestine Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hezbollah retaliated swiftly with the firing of approximately 100 katyusha rockets aimed at Israeli military positions, marking a dramatic escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two adversaries.\n\nThe announcement of Nasser's death was made via Hezbollah's official channel on Telegram, although specific details about the location of the attack were not disclosed initially. Sources close to the group later confirmed to media outlets that Nasser had been killed in the Hosh area of Tyre, a city in southern Lebanon known for its historical significance and proximity to the Israeli border, according to AL Jazeera.\n\nNasser held a senior rank within Hezbollah, comparable to that of Taleb Abdallah, another prominent commander who was killed in a previous Israeli attack in June. The loss of such high-ranking officials underscores the intensity and strategic significance of the conflict, which has been ongoing for nearly nine months and has seen periodic flare-ups leading to concerns about broader regional instability.\n\nIsraeli military officials acknowledged targeting Nasser, describing him as a key figure responsible for Hezbollah's operations involving anti-tank and rocket systems in southwestern Lebanon. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have maintained a stance of pre-emptive strikes against Hezbollah positions, citing security concerns and the need to protect Israeli territory from potential attacks.\n\nIn response to the escalating violence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasised the need for heightened security measures in northern Israel, where communities have faced increased threats from Hezbollah's rocket fire.\n\nNetanyahu's government has faced pressure from within Israel, with calls from some far-right ministers for a full-scale invasion of Hezbollah-controlled territory in Lebanon--a move that could escalate the conflict further and potentially lead to broader regional implications.\n\nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, known for his fiery rhetoric and staunch defence of the group's military actions, has warned of readiness for an all-out war with Israel, characterized by unrestricted warfare and a willingness to engage without restraint. Nasrallah's statements have been consistent with Hezbollah's longstanding position of preparedness against what it perceives as Israeli aggression and threats to Lebanon's sovereignty.\n\nThe recent exchanges of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel have prompted international concern, with diplomatic efforts underway to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been vocal in his calls for de-escalation, urging Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to avoid actions that could ignite a broader conflict detrimental to both Lebanese and Israeli interests.\n\nMacron \"reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel ... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel,\" the French presidency said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, United States Envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts in Lebanon, is coordinating with French counterparts to seek avenues for mediation and ceasefire negotiations. The United States, along with European and Arab states, has a vested interest in stabilizing the situation and preventing a wider regional conflagration that could have far-reaching consequences beyond Lebanon and Israel.\n\nAmidst the diplomatic manoeuvring and military engagements, the civilian toll continues to mount on both sides.\n\nLebanese authorities report that over 543 people, including 88 civilians, have been killed by Israeli attacks since the conflict intensified. In Israel, at least 21 people, including 10 civilians, have lost their lives due to Hezbollah's rocket fire and other attacks targeting civilian areas, Al Jazeera reported.\n\n(With Inputs From

And Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of advanced drone weapons, Russian-made supersonic anti-ship missiles and 130,000-150,000 rockets and missiles, many of which can reach deep into Israel. A war would also likely drag in Iran, which in April fired a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel.\n\nLast week, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned during a visit to Washington that Israel could bomb Lebanon \"back to the Stone Age\" in any war with Hezbollah, but he also said his government prefers a diplomatic solution to restore peace on the Israel-Lebanon border. On Wednesday, another 100 Hezbollah missiles landed in Northern Israel, after an Israeli airstrike killed a senior Hezbollah commander.\n\nIsrael faces a dilemma: How much can it take? And how best to respond? Israel has a long history of pursuing foreign militias in Lebanon, most notably its 1982 invasion of the country after continued attacks from Lebanon-based terrorists of the Palestine Liberation Organization. During its last major incursion into Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Lebanon, in 2006, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) pushed Hezbollah back behind the Litani River, and the United Nations drew the so-called \"Blue Line,\" beyond which Hezbollah was not supposed to stray.\n\nBut Hezbollah has repeatedly breached the Blue Line. And that - along with the recent Hezbollah strikes - is why Israel has been preparing for an invasion of Lebanon that would push Hezbollah back to the Blue Line and end its ability to attack Northern Israel.\n\nThe stakes are high: Hezbollah's attacks have forced some 60,000 people from their homes, ignited large forest fires, and shut down Northern Israel's economy. Israel has \"lost sovereignty\" in the north from Hezbollah's attacks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday. But if Israel decides to invade Lebanon, can it stop Hezbollah? And if so, at what cost?\n\nCipher Brief reporter Peter Green spoke with Giora Eiland, a retired major general who served as planning and operations chief of the IDF and later as national security adviser to the late prime minister, Ariel Sharon. Eiland takes a dim view of Israel's chances of defeating Hezbollah in a full-on military confrontation. Instead, he says, Israel must make clear to Lebanon - and the world -- that continuing to allow Hezbollah to operate with impunity means Lebanon is responsible for the attacks on Israel.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: There seems to have been a fundamental shift in Hezbollah's position toward Israel, and a much greater willingness to fight. What's happened?\n\nGiora Eiland: There is significant change in the situation along the northern border, and it is not only reflected in the way that things are happening on the ground. There is a shift in the policy of Hezbollah. In the very first days (after) October 7, Hezbollah opened fire against Israel as a symbolic political act, to show the Palestinians in Gaza they have some support from Hezbollah. So despite the hatred between Shia and Sunnis, as long as Israel is concerned, they are actually brothers, and they can help each other.\n\nBut Hezbollah was not really keen to open a new front. And when we managed to achieve a temporary ceasefire in November, Hezbollah immediately stopped all their attacks against Israel. But today, Israel is finding it very, very difficult to win in Gaza, and Israel is completely isolated in the international arena. So Hezbollah has become more confident that it can continue to fight Israel. But more than that, until April, Hezbollah assumed that in a full war with Israel, it would have to fight Israel more or less alone. Now, we understand that if such a war breaks out, there is a good chance that Iran will attack Israel directly. That gives Hezbollah much more confidence that Israel is actually deterred [by the threat of Iranian involvement]. And the more deterred Israel is, the more aggressive Hezbollah can be. So we are in a very delicate situation.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: What about the Americans? Can they help?\n\nGiora Eiland: The American position is very problematic, to say the least. The United States is actually telling Israel not to open total war in Lebanon, that we, the United States, are not only against it, but actually, we do not believe that you will be successful. And more than that, if Iran decides to join the party, we are not sure that we are going to help you. This is something that brings Israel to a very delicate strategic situation. And then the Americans say, If and when you will be in total war in Lebanon, because you have no other choice and it might be understandable, you should attack only Hezbollah targets. Don't you dare touch the state of Lebanon. And this is a complete recipe for Israeli defeat. So all in all, we are in a real deep hole strategically. That's why I am so worried.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: Is there any way that Israel could defeat Hezbollah, or at least bring an end to the assault on Northern Israel?\n\nGiora Eiland: The only real way to win a war in Lebanon is to fight against the state of Lebanon and not against Hezbollah.\n\nI need to explain something very fundamental and important - and completely missing in the international press or in international dialogue. And that is that whenever we [call an armed movement] a terrorist organization, whether it is Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen or elsewhere, we underestimate the real character of our enemies. A terrorist organization is a group of a few hundred or a few thousand people with Kalashnikovs. ISIS was a terrorist organization, al-Qaeda was a terrorist organization. Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, some of the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, are not terrorist organizations. These are really advanced armies that enjoy all the characteristics of a modern army, they have an unlimited number of fighters because these organizations are the only ones that can offer good pay for young people in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen, Syria, or Iraq. So everybody wants to join them because they get a decent salary.\n\nThey have a huge amount of weapons and ammunition, they have unlimited financial resources, and more than that, in the past decade, they got all of Iran's advanced technology. So they managed to bridge the technological gap between them and us, especially with regard to precision weapons. And of course, they are not committed to [respect] any international norms. They can still be assimilated within the population, so when you shoot at them you kill civilians, and then everybody in the world is mad at Israel.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: So then how do you fight Hezbollah?\n\nGiora Eiland: The only potential leverage over Hezbollah is the simple fact that Hezbollah is an official part of the Lebanese government, it has ministers, and representatives in Lebanon's parliament. And more than that, Hezbollah presents itself as Lebanese patriots, saying \"We defend Lebanon, we care about Lebanon, we have the defensive forces that keep Lebanon alive and safe.\" That's what they claim, and they depend very much on their internal legitimacy in Lebanon.\n\nAnd that's why the only real worry of [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah is a scenario in which Israel will attack the infrastructure of the state of Lebanon: energy, communication, transportation, everything. And if the condition of [Lebanon's] roads will look like the condition of Gaza, then Hezbollah understands that many Lebanese including from [Hezbollah's] own Shia community will come to them complaining, \"Why the hell did you bring such a catastrophe on our heads, just to signal some support to these crazy cousins in Ramallah and Gaza?\"\n\nIf we decide to fight only against Hezbollah, they know that they can absorb a large number of casualties among their combatants because it is not difficult to draft others. They can use a lot of missiles and other weapons systems because Iran will bring others. So the only thing they are concerned about is the protection of the state of Lebanon in that they pretend they are defending Lebanon.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: How does Israel capitalize on that?\n\nGiora Eiland: To pursue this strategy, it is not enough that Israel will make a unilateral decision. It needs diplomatic cooperation, which is completely missing today. When I'm told the Americans will not agree to something like this, my only answer is that Israel actually has only two options: either to agree to be defeated, or to choose the strategy that I recommend. So we have to choose between these two options, there is no other.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: So you're saying turn Lebanon into Gaza?\n\nGiora Eiland: No, we made a similar mistake in Gaza. We never said that we are fighting in Gaza against the state of Gaza, although Gaza in practical terms was and is a state. The party that won the election is the government in command. But we failed because we said we're fighting only against the terrorist organization, we have nothing to do with the state of Gaza, we have nothing to do with the people of Gaza. It was a terrible mistake, and that's the main reason why we failed to win this war.\n\nThe precondition for something like this is to give a different definition to the simple question of \"Who is the enemy?\" So everything begins with the narrative, not with military moves.\n\nTo be successful in Lebanon, we must begin with a diplomatic dialogue, and we have to explain this point. Otherwise, we will be in a terrible situation again. We are not fighting terrorist organizations. Not more than 10% of the countries of the world have an arsenal more impressive than the arsenal of Hezbollah. The Houthis in Yemen can launch precise ballistic missiles to the range of 2,000 kilometers. We are speaking about Iranian armies deployed around Israel or in many other places in the Middle East.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: So unless Israel can build international diplomatic and political consensus, it won't defeat Hezbollah within Lebanon?\n\nGiora Eiland: Hezbollah is not deterred by anything, especially when they have such strong Iranian backing. The only way to make the war shorter or maybe to deter Hezbollah even before we come to an [all-out] war, is if everybody understands that such a war will lead to the full devastation of the state of Lebanon, something that no one wants. Neither the United States nor France, Saudi Arabia, but also Iran. The only real ability that we have [to prevent a war] is to convince their patrons that we have no choice but to destroy the country that is not only hosting Hezbollah, but that is actually fully occupied by Hezbollah. Lebanon and Hezbollah are in fact one entity.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: And if you don't get the U.S. and the Saudis and the Lebanese onboard?\n\nGiora Eiland: At some point, we might have no other choice than to begin a war and hopefully to be able to explain our position during the war. But it is better to have some dialogue with the Americans in advance.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: And is that a failure on the part of the Israeli government or the Americans or both?\n\nGiora Eiland: Both. The Israeli leadership today is in a totally weak situation. There is a mutual lack of trust, and the Americans fail to understand the real nature of the war here.\n\nThe Cipher Brief: But if Israel has to go it alone, does it have the ability to wage war on a second front in Lebanon while it is still fighting in Gaza?\n\nGiora Eiland: Yes, and again, it depends on which kind of war. If you rely mainly on massive ground operations, we might be very short of enough troops to deploy. But if the main goal would be to destroy everything that belongs to the state of Lebanon, we have enough air force capabilities. So we can do it in parallel to whatever is happening now.", "source": {"uri": "thecipherbrief.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cipher Brief"}, "authors": [{"uri":

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt said about 200 \"projectiles\" were launched toward the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and over 20 drones into Israeli territory, but that it had intercepted some of them.\n\nIsrael after Hezbollah's attack struck various towns in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah's \"military structures\" in the southern border towns of Ramyeh and Houla. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported an Israeli drone strike of Houla killed at least one person. Israeli jets also broke the sound barrier over the Lebanese capital and other areas in the country.\n\nColumn: Janet Jackson surprises St. Louis dance class, and I was there Ramsay's Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay is worse than bad.

He must end it.\n\nIsrael on Wednesday acknowledged that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours after the killing, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nHashem Safieddine, head of Hezbollah's Executive Council, vowed that the group will continue its retaliatory attacks, \"targeting new sites they never imagined would be hit.\"\n\n\"The enemy sometimes acknowledges these hits and sometimes does not, but it is certain that there have been many casualties,\" he said at Nasser's funeral.\n\nNasser was of great importance to Hezbollah, which said he took part in battles in conflicts in Syria and Iraq from 2011 until 2016 and fought in the group's last war with Israel in 2006. Two other senior Hezbollah commanders have also been killed.\n\nThe U.S. and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiraling into an all-out war, which they fear could spillover across the region. Washington in its shuttle diplomatic efforts initially hoped for calm along the Lebanon-Israel border in a deal that is not linked to the war in Gaza. However, since the U.S. has called for Hamas to agree to a cease-fire proposal presented by President Joe Biden, it has said that an end to the war in Gaza would lead to calm in Lebanon and northern Israel as well.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The group's leadership says it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in Gaza, and that while it does not want war, it is ready for one.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail.\n\nHezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians -- have been killed.\n\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.\n\nIn 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war that ended in a draw.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType":

at Israel after commander's killing", "body": "Smoke billows after a hit from a rocket fired from southern Lebanon over the Upper Galilee region in northern Israel on July 4, 2024\n\nLebanon's Hezbollah said it launched more than 200 rockets and explosive drones Thursday at Israeli military positions as tensions have soared amid the almost nine-months-old Gaza war.\n\nThe Iran-backed militant group said its latest attack, which followed the launch of over 100 rockets the previous day, was in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander.\n\nIsrael did not report any deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with air strikes on targets in southern Lebanon.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears that the clashes could escalate into a new all-out war.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces were \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon\" after \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory\", most of which were intercepted.\n\nIt said \"fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel\" following the attacks.\n\nIsrael on Wednesday killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, near the Lebanese coastal town of Tyre.\n\nAn undated handout photo released by the Hezbollah military media press office on July 4, 2024 shows the late Hezbollah military commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser\n\nA source close to the group described Nasser as the \"Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon\".\n\nHezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy\" it had fired \"more than 200 rockets of various types\" and \"a squadron of explosive drones\" at Israeli bases including in the annexed Golan Heights.\n\nAir raid sires blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted by Israeli air defences.\n\n- Gaza war grinds on -\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nAn Israeli bombardment targets the southern Lebanese village of Khiyam on July 3, 2024\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,953 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted, stoking fears of an escalation.\n\nThe border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres's spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday that \"we're very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire\".\n\nSmoke rises from an area targeted by Israeli bombardment in the eastern Shujaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City on July 3, 2024\n\nHe warned of the potential risks to the region \"as a whole if we were to find ourselves in a full fledged conflict\".\n\nThe Gaza war has raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and artillery shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day as thousands of Palestinians joined an exodus of far-southern areas near Egypt after an army evacuation order.\n\nLong-stalled efforts towards a Gaza truce and hostage release deal regained some momentum after Hamas said late Wednesday it had sent new \"ideas\" to mediators and Israel confirmed it was \"evaluating\" them.\n\nThe Israeli military said its troops are fighting militants in the streets of Gaza City and destroying their infrastructure, tunnel shafts and weapons depots.\n\nTroops over the past day \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" said the military.\n\nPalestinians on a donkey cart in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on July 3, 2024\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in Gaza's southern areas near the cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the army will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nThe United Nations has long urged a ceasefire, and its humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week again called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".\n\nburs-tw/fz/ami", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War",

Sirens sounded as far south as the city of Acre, 20 kilometres from the border, where part of an air-defence missile fell on a shopping mall. Israel said 200 projectiles and 20 \"suspicious aerial targets\" had been launched from Lebanon. At least two people were wounded.\n\nThe Israeli military said it responded to the attacks by targeting launching sites across southern Lebanon. At least two sonic booms were heard over Beirut, marking the second day in a row that Israeli jets have conducted mock bombing raids over the Lebanese capital.\n\nThe escalation followed Wednesday's assassination of Mohammed Nasser, who was described by Hezbollah as one of its regional commanders. Mr. Nasser was killed along with another Hezbollah member when an explosive drone struck their car near the southern Lebanese city of Tyre.\n\nMr. Nasser's death came three weeks after Taleb Abdallah, another of Hezbollah's top frontline commanders, was killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in southern Lebanon. That assassination was followed by a similar response, with Hezbollah claiming to launch some 215 missiles and drones at nine military targets in Israel.\n\nQassem Qasir, a Lebanese expert on Hezbollah, said Mr. Nasser appeared to be equal in rank to Mr. Abdallah. \"This is part of Israel's plan to get rid of all the resistance leaders on the ground,\" Mr. Qasir said of the assassination.\n\nThe Israeli military said Mr. Nasser held several key roles within Hezbollah and had \"led the rockets and anti-tank missile attacks from southwestern Lebanon toward Israeli civilians, communities and security forces\" before and since the start of the most recent fighting.\n\nOn Thursday, some 1,000 mourners - including about 100 camouflage-clad fighters - gathered for a memorial service for Mr. Nasser held in a hangar in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Afterwards, the crowd chanted, \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" as Mr. Nasser's coffin, draped in a yellow Hezbollah flag, was carried through the streets.\n\nHashem Safieddin, the head of Hezbollah's executive council, told the mourners that the military response to Mr. Nasser's killing was ongoing and \"will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not think would be hit. It is certain that there are many casualties, including dead and wounded.\" Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was expected to give a speech Friday.\n\nMr. Qasir said he expected Hezbollah's response would stay within the unofficial rules of the conflict to date, striking at only military targets in the north of Israel - with the militia holding back on using its longer-range arsenal. Both sides have evacuated most of their citizens from the towns and villages in the border area, though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under escalating pressure to do something to change the status quo so the 60,000 residents of northern Israel who have been living in internal exile since October can return in time for the start of the new school year. An estimated 100,000 Lebanese have also been forced to flee their homes.\n\nMore than 435 Lebanese have been killed over the past nine months, including upwards of 350 acknowledged by Hezbollah as members. Nineteen Israeli soldiers have been killed on the country's northern front.\n\nThe long-simmering conflict was reignited by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, which killed more than 1,100 people and provoked an Israeli invasion of Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, including 58 more on Thursday alone, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Hezbollah says its near-daily missile and drone launches are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians - both it and Hamas are backed by Iran - and that it will cease its attacks as soon as there is a complete ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nMr. Netanyahu, who has resisted pressure from the U.S. and other Western governments to bring the Gaza campaign to an end, was due to discuss the latest ceasefire proposal with his security cabinet Thursday. He suggested last month that Israel could begin moving more troops to the Lebanese border as the fighting in Gaza winds down.\n\nMr. Qasir said any escalation of the current fighting between Israel and Hezbollah is in Mr. Netanyahu's hands. \"We're in a position where it's really difficult to predict what is going to happen next,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType":

rockets at Israel after commander's killing", "body": "Beirut (Lebanon) (AFP) - Lebanon's Hezbollah said it launched more than 200 rockets and explosive drones Thursday at Israeli military positions as tensions have soared amid the almost nine-months-old Gaza war.\n\nThe Iran-backed militant group said its latest attack, which followed the launch of over 100 rockets the previous day, was in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander.\n\nIsrael did not report any deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with air strikes on targets in southern Lebanon.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears that the clashes could escalate into a new all-out war.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces were \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon\" after \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory\", most of which were intercepted.\n\nIt said \"fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel\" following the attacks.\n\nIsrael on Wednesday killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, near the Lebanese coastal town of Tyre.\n\nA source close to the group described Nasser as the \"Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon\".\n\nHezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy\" it had fired \"more than 200 rockets of various types\" and \"a squadron of explosive drones\" at Israeli bases including in the annexed Golan Heights.\n\nAir raid sires blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted by Israeli air defences.\n\nGaza war grinds on\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,953 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted, stoking fears of an escalation.\n\nThe border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres's spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday that \"we're very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire\".\n\nHe warned of the potential risks to the region \"as a whole if we were to find ourselves in a full fledged conflict\".\n\nThe Gaza war has raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and artillery shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day as thousands of Palestinians joined an exodus of far-southern areas near Egypt after an army evacuation order.\n\nLong-stalled efforts towards a Gaza truce and hostage release deal regained some momentum after Hamas said late Wednesday it had sent new \"ideas\" to mediators and Israel confirmed it was \"evaluating\" them.\n\nThe Israeli military said its troops are fighting militants in the streets of Gaza City and destroying their infrastructure, tunnel shafts and weapons depots.\n\nTroops over the past day \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" said the military.\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in Gaza's southern areas near the cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the army will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nThe United Nations has long urged a ceasefire, and its humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week again called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".",

Last month Israel also eliminated Taleb Abdullah, another commander at the same level as Nasser who led the Nasr unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe recent retaliation by the Iranian-backed Lebanese group has been one of the most intense since the border conflict erupted in October. Air raid alarms have been sounded not only in the border communities, but also in the southern Golan Heights and in coastal towns such as Nahariya and Acre.\n\nAccording to The Jerusalem Post, these attacks - several of them intercepted by air defence systems - have resulted in injuries and fires in certain areas in the north.\n\nHezbollah began firing shells at Israel following an attack by its Palestinian ally Hamas on 7 October and does not intend to cease its offensive until a ceasefire is reached in the Gaza Strip. \"If there is a truce in Gaza we will stop without any discussion,\" Shi'ite militia deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said during an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nKassem told the news agency that Hezbollah's involvement in the war between Israel and Hamas serves as a \"support front\" for its ally, so that \"if the war stops, this military support will no longer exist\".\n\nThe conflict in the Palestinian enclave began after a Hamas attack in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 others kidnapped. In response, Israel launched an air and ground offensive against Gaza that has left more than 37,000 dead, according to Hamas-controlled Gazan health authorities.\n\nIn the midst of this war, hostilities with Hezbollah, especially since late May, have heightened fears of a full-scale conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militia, a scenario that would have devastating consequences for both sides\n\nFor the moment, the fighting has already forced thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border. Similarly, Israeli attacks in Lebanon have left more than 300 Hezbollah fighters dead, as well as 87 civilians, according to a Reuters tally. In Israel, meanwhile, the Shi'ite organisation's offensive has killed 18 soldiers and 11 civilians.\n\nThe United States has stepped up diplomatic efforts to try to reach a solution that avoids open war. This is, in fact, the main objective of the Lebanese political authorities, since a conflict would plunge the country of cedars even deeper into the instability it has suffered for years.\n\nIn his latest speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that the militia was not seeking \"all-out war\" but would be willing to fight if necessary, asserting that \"there would be no safe place\" in Israel in such a situation.\n\nCoinciding with the recent Hezbollah attacks, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has stressed that Israeli forces are attacking Hezbollah \"very hard every day\" and will be ready to take any necessary action against the group. However, he also indicated that Israel's preference is for a negotiated settlement.\n\nHezbollah, a far more powerful and better prepared organisation than Hamas, possesses a large arsenal of rockets and missiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. Moreover, an all-out war with the pro-Iranian Lebanese militia would be a new front when Israeli military efforts remain focused on Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news",

Lebanon, July 4, 2024 (AFP) - Lebanon's Hezbollah said it launched more than 200 rockets and explosive drones Thursday at Israeli military positions as tensions have soared amid the almost nine-months-old Gaza war.\n\nThe Iran-backed militant group said its latest attack, which followed the launch of over 100 rockets the previous day, was in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander.\n\nIsrael did not report any deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with air strikes on targets in southern Lebanon.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears that the clashes could escalate into a new all-out war.\n\nThe Israeli military said its forces were \"striking launch posts in southern Lebanon\" after \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory\", most of which were intercepted.\n\nIt said \"fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel\" following the attacks.\n\nIsrael on Wednesday killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, near the Lebanese coastal town of Tyre.\n\nA source close to the group described Nasser as the \"Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon\".\n\nHezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy\" it had fired \"more than 200 rockets of various types\" and \"a squadron of explosive drones\" at Israeli bases including in the annexed Golan Heights.\n\nAir raid sires blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted by Israeli air defences.\n\n- Gaza war grinds on -\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,953 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted, stoking fears of an escalation.\n\nThe border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres's spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday that \"we're very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire\".\n\nHe warned of the potential risks to the region \"as a whole if we were to find ourselves in a full fledged conflict\".\n\nThe Gaza war has raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and artillery shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day as thousands of Palestinians joined an exodus of far-southern areas near Egypt after an army evacuation order.\n\nLong-stalled efforts towards a Gaza truce and hostage release deal regained some momentum after Hamas said late Wednesday it had sent new \"ideas\" to mediators and Israel confirmed it was \"evaluating\" them.\n\nThe Israeli military said its troops are fighting militants in the streets of Gaza City and destroying their infrastructure, tunnel shafts and weapons depots.\n\nTroops over the past day \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" said the military.\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in Gaza's southern areas near the cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the army will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nThe United Nations has long urged a ceasefire, and its humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week again called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net",

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt acknowledged on Wednesday that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours later, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nThe U.S. and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiraling into an all-out war, which they fear could spillover across the region.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt acknowledged on Wednesday that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours later, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday.\n\nThe US and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiralling into an all-out war, which they fear could spill over across the Arab world.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its October 7 attack into southern Israel.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.\n\nIn Lebanon, more than 450 people - mostly fighters but also dozens of civilians - have been killed.\n\nIsraeli officials, meanwhile, say they could decide to go to war in Lebanon if efforts for a diplomatic solution fail.\n\nHezbollah's retaliation comes a day after a senior adviser to US President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, met with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris.\n\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.\n\nIn 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war that ended in stalemate.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's cabinet is set to convene to discuss Hamas' latest response to the US-backed proposal for a phased ceasefire in Gaza, as diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the nine-month war stirred back to life.\n\nThe US has rallied world support behind a plan that would see the release of all of the scores of hostages still held by the militant group in return for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But until now, neither side appears to have fully embraced it.\n\nHamas suggested \"amendments\" last month, some of which the US said were unworkable, without providing specifics. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed that the original proposal was an Israeli one, but has raised doubts over whether it would end the war - a key Hamas demand.\n\nHamas confirmed on Wednesday that it had sent another response to Egypt and Qatar, which are mediating the talks, without providing details.

The Israeli military said that most of that barrage had fallen in open areas. The Iran-backed militia continued to claim retaliatory attacks into the evening.\n\nThe death of Mr. Naameh, which Israel's military confirmed in a statement, marked the latest in a string of Israeli killings of Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon, one of which led to an escalation in cross-border exchanges of fire last month that the Biden administration has since battled to contain. With tensions already high, analysts warned that the tit-for-tat strikes could trigger a further escalation and risk open war.\n\nAmal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University who researches Hezbollah, said that although the powerful militia was unlikely to allow itself to be dragged into an all-out war over the killing, recent threats by Israeli officials would not deter Hezbollah from responding with strength.\n\n\"I don't think Hezbollah will downplay this,\" said Ms. Saad, adding that the rocket barrage was only \"a small teaser of what is to come.\"\n\nThe border flare-up on Wednesday took place as a top U.S. official was in Paris to discuss with French officials how to defuse the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. Amos Hochstein, a senior White House adviser who has become the de facto U.S. envoy in the quest to resolve the border conflict, met with Jean-Yves Le Drian, President Emmanuel Macron's special envoy to Lebanon, according to a person close to the talks, who spoke on the condition on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.\n\nLebanon was a French protectorate after World War I, and France still has some influence there. The White House had no immediate comment about Mr. Hochstein's visit.\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has so far remained contained, but as exchanges of cross-border fire have intensified in recent weeks, Israeli officials have spoken publicly of shifting their military focus from Hamas to Hezbollah, a far more advanced military threat.\n\nMore than 150,000 people have already been displaced on both sides of the border. If a full-scale war were to break out, analysts say, it would likely prove catastrophic, leaving swaths of Lebanon in ruins, causing Hezbollah to unleash its arsenal of precision-guided missiles on cities across Israel and potentially setting off an even wider regional war. Israel's military leadership has been pressing for the government to reach a cease-fire with Hamas so that Israeli fighting forces can prepare for the possibility of a war with Hezbollah, according to Israeli security officials.\n\nIsrael's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Wednesday that Israeli forces were prepared to take any action necessary against Hezbollah but that they preferred a diplomatic settlement.\n\n\"We are striking Hezbollah very hard every day and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength,\" said Mr. Gallant, according to a statement from his office.\n\n\"We prefer an arrangement, but if reality forces us we will know how to fight,\" he added.", "source": {"uri":

His death came after an Israeli strike in June killed Taleb Abdallah, who headed another sector.\n\nSpeaking at Nasser's funeral, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned Israel against \"imagining that targeting these heroes would ever leave the south exposed\".\n\n\"When any leader becomes a martyr, another takes up the banner and proceeds with new, firm and strong resolve.\"\n\n- Heavy battles rock Gaza -\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nMore from this section Addressing moral injury within the special forces: Weapons and Warfare US: Overnight Torrential Rains Cause Severe Flooding In Jersey Shore Operation Lone Star: Texas' $11 billion border security challenge\n\nThe Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.\n\nThe Gaza war at the heart of the tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day on Thursday.\n\nIsraeli troops \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" the military said.\n\nGaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\n- Efforts towards truce -\n\nIsrael has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.\n\nThe UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week truce and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThere has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.\n\nHamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had \"made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement\".\n\nNetanyahu's office said Wednesday that \"Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators\".\n\nThe main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting, which Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners strongly reject.\n\nburs/fz/kir", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com", "name": "Agence

Most of the attacks began around ten in the morning and continued throughout the day. They also mostly involved the use of drones, which have become one of the main Hezbollah weapons in its arsenal since the October 7 war began and Hezbollah chose to begin attacks on Israel.\n\nHezbollah claimed, via Iranian media, that it had \"launched a barrage of rockets at several Israeli military positions in response to the regime's killing of one of its commanders in southern Lebanon.\" It said that that it targeted \"five Israeli military positions, including 100 Katyushas that targeted the headquarters of the Golan Division as well as Israel's air and missile systems at Nafah Base,\" Iran's IRNA reported.\n\nHezbollah calls this a retaliation for Israel killing Muhammad Nimah Nasser, known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\", on Wednesday. He is the second high level Hezbollah commander killed in the last month. Another one was killed on June 12. Hezbollah responded in June by firing up to 215 rockets and projectiles at northern Israel.\n\nHezbollah members of parliament have said the retaliation against Israel will increase. \"Hassan Fadlallah [a member of Lebanon's parliament for Hezbollah] stressed that Hezbollah's punitive response will come, and the enemy should realize that the resistance front has the upper hand,\" IRNA reported. Hezbollah continues to warn Israel about launching a large military operation in Lebanon. Iran has also issued warning about the chances of an escalating war. Advertisement\n\nClearly Iran and Hezbollah do not want a larger war, because Iran wants to preserve Hezbollah so it can use it against Israel. Hezbollah has accomplished many of its aims over nine months of attacks. It has depopulated areas in northern Israel, including Kiryat Shmona, an unprecedented \"success\", in the eyes of Hezbollah.\n\nA recent article at the Iranian state media IRNA, which reprints Hezbollah claims, noted that Israelis who left the north in October due to the attacks have become \"refugees\" in hotels in Israel. This is Iran and Hezbollah's plan. Their plan does not want a major war because they are concerned about the damage Hezbollah will suffer.\n\nHezbollah's true message\n\nThe message from Hezbollah is clear from its attacks. It used drones in many incidents on Wednesday between 10am and noon, targeting an increasingly large area between the Sea of Galilee and Metulla. This including numerous sirens in the Golan and also in the Huleh valley. These included the communities that overlook the Huleh such as Shamir and Gonen. It also included Katzrin in the Golan. At 11:23am the area of Hezbollah attacks expanded to target Nahariya, and communities along the coast as well as further inland.\n\nHezbollah's message is clear. It has the large drone arsenal and also rocket and missile arsenal to chose where and when to attack. It has leaned into its drone arsenal over the last months, increasing its use of drones. This is because drones can be precise and effective and also they cause sirens in wide areas. Hezbollah can then achieve a multi-pronged list of what it sees as \"successes.\" It can target Israeli areas with precision, as well as cause civilian areas to be forced into shelters through sirens. Hezbollah often relies on Israeli media to bolster its sense of accomplishment. It will sometimes seek to launder news through foreign media and then re-report its won \"success\" via Al-Mayadeen in order to make its claims seem more legitimate.\n\nThe point here is that Hezbollah's claims alone do not make them true, but it thinks it makes it seem more accurate if it can get others to re-report its claims. Therefore the increase in attacks in retaliation for the killing of the commander will also be waged online and on media. For instance Al-Mayadeen reported that Israel's Haaretz had said there are \"difficult days\" ahead now after the killing of Nasser in Lebanon.

It was founded in the 1980s, after Israel, responding to attacks, invaded and occupied southern Lebanon, intending to root out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was then based in the country.\n\nBut Israel soon ran into a new foe, one whose guerrilla fighters quickly grew effective at bedeviling the far-better-equipped Israeli forces: Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim popular movement that made driving Israel out of Lebanon a major goal.\n\nBy 2000, Israel had withdrawn from Lebanon, making Hezbollah a hero to many Lebanese. It fought Israel again in 2006, launching a military operation into its southern neighbor that led to a fierce counterattack. In that war, Israel rained bombs on southern Lebanon and Beirut, the capital; the fighting killed more than 1,000 Lebanese.\n\nYet, the Israeli military never managed to overwhelm Hezbollah in 34 days of war, allowing the group and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, to emerge as stars in an Arab world wearily accustomed to being defeated by Israel.\n\nHezbollah soon allied with Iran, and they became close partners.\n\nThough the group retains a large and loyal following among Shiite Muslims because of the social services and political power it offers them -- as well as the authoritarian tactics it uses to quell any dissent -- many Lebanese see the group as an obstacle to progress that keeps threatening to drag the country into an unwanted war.\n\nHezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States and other countries, has evolved from a fighting force into a dominant political one, accruing significant influence in Lebanon's government.\n\nToday, Lebanon is politically deadlocked, but few major changes can occur without Hezbollah's approval.\n\nLebanon can hardly afford a new conflict with Israel.\n\nThe country is reeling from years of an economic crisis that has left countless Lebanese in poverty and a political one that has stripped citizens of many basic services. The strikes at the border have displaced about 100,000 Lebanese civilians, depriving many of their income and their homes, and have cost the country billions of dollars in lost tourism and agricultural revenue, Lebanese officials say.\n\nLebanon can also count on less international support, with its former colonial power, France, distracted by internal politics, said Emile Hokayem, who specializes in Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Other Arab states and Iran, which pumped money into rebuilding Lebanon after 2006, are less willing or able to help.\n\n\"It was already difficult in 2006, when the economic situation and Lebanon's international position were considerably better,\" Hokayem said. \"The country is not in a position to deal with this conflict.\"\n\nEven some of Hezbollah's traditionally loyal Shiite Muslim constituents in southern Lebanon are questioning the price of the current fighting. As a result, analysts say, Nasrallah knows he has to step carefully. He has said that Hezbollah does not want a broader conflict, while warning that his fighters are prepared for one -- and that Israel will face serious consequences if it comes.\n\n\"If war is imposed, the resistance will fight without constraints, rules or limits,\" Nasrallah said in a speech two weeks ago.\n\nA Hezbollah-Israel war could also metastasize into a larger regional war that would dwarf the ongoing fighting. Such a conflict could draw in Iran, as well as the United States, which has been working to avert further escalation.\n\nThough jitters have grown with the frequency and deadliness of each side's strikes, Israel, Hezbollah and Iran do not want a full-fledged war, analysts and U.S. officials say. Yet, the only near-certain way to avoid one, they say, is to end the fighting in Gaza with a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas, whose Oct. 7 attack led to the war in the enclave.\n\nThrough propaganda videos and calibrated strikes, Hezbollah has repeatedly displayed signs of a bulked-up arsenal that analysts say is capable of inflicting heavy damage on Israeli cities. Its forces are also battle-tested after years of fighting against rebels in Syria, where Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters during that country's civil war to help prop up the government of President Bashar Assad, a close ally of Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nIran-backed militia fighters in Iraq could also join the fight if Israel attacks Lebanon, Hokayem said.\n\nEstimates vary about just how many missiles Hezbollah has and just how sophisticated its systems are. The CIA's World Factbook says the group may have more than 150,000 missiles and rockets of various types and ranges. It also estimates that the group has up to 45,000 fighters, though Nasrallah has claimed to have 100,000.\n\nBut analysts and Israeli officials say Hezbollah's arsenal is considerably more dangerous than Hamas' because of its precision-guided missiles, which could target critical Israeli infrastructure and military assets.\n\nHezbollah has also displayed exploding drones that can elude Israel's Iron Dome, the detect-and-shoot-down system designed to protect the country from incoming rockets and missiles. The group also appears to have anti-tank missiles that fly too fast and too low for the Iron Dome to intercept.\n\nNasrallah warned in his speech two weeks ago that Hezbollah had used just a small fraction of its weapons. If necessary, he said, Hezbollah could launch them on \"a bank of targets\" in precision strikes.\n\n\"The enemy knows it must expect us on land, in the air and at sea,\" he said.\n\nSome in Israel are wary of exposing their country to such an arsenal. But others argue that Israel must do something before Hezbollah grows stronger.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Another border sector chief was killed in an Israeli strike last month.\n\nHezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy\" it had fired \"more than 200 rockets\" and \"a squadron of explosive drones\" at Israeli bases.\n\nAir raid sirens blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted.\n\n- Heavy battles rock Gaza -\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nThe Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.\n\nThe Gaza war at the heart of the regional tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and artillery shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day on Thursday.\n\nIsraeli troops over the past day had \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" said the military.\n\nGaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in Gaza's southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\nWitnesses reported air strikes and intense artillery shelling in western Rafah on Thursday.\n\n- Efforts towards truce -\n\nIsrael has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.\n\nThe UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week again called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week ceasefire and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nThere has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.\n\nHamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had \"made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement\".\n\nNetanyahu's office and the Mossad intelligence service said \"Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators\".\n\nThe main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting -- a demand Netanyahu and his right-wing nationalist government allies strongly reject.\n\nburs/fz/ami\n\nMore from this section\n\nTeal in Top Best Managed Service Providers by Channel Futures\n\niMyFone MagicMic - The Best AI Voice Changer for PC and Mobile\n\n'Artificial

Together, they served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in Southern Lebanon,\" the IDF statement concluded.\n\n'People don't feel safe to go to their homes'\n\nAfter Abdullah was killed in June, Hezbollah launched one of its largest barrages of rockets and explosive drones towards the Jewish state's north, sparking large fires and lightly wounding two civilians.\n\nFollowing the news of Nasser's death, air-raid alerts sounded in the northern city of Kiryat Shmona and Kibbutz Manara, warning of renewed rocket attacks from Lebanon and sending the remaining residents of the mostly evacuated border area scrambling for shelter.\n\nHezbollah subsequently claimed it fired some 100 Katyusha rockets towards military sites in the Golan Heights and Galilee, per Al-Akhbar. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages in the attacks, which sparked fires in the central Golan Heights, Channel 12 reported.\n\nHezbollah has attacked Israel's north nearly every day since Oct. 8, firing thousands of UAVs, rockets and anti-tank missiles at Israeli towns, killing more than 20 people and causing widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain displaced due to the violence.\n\nIn an interview on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel has \"effectively lost sovereignty\" over its northern territory.\n\n\"People don't feel safe to go to their homes,\" the top diplomat told the Brookings Institute, noting that \"absent doing something about the insecurity, people won't have the confidence to go back.\"\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to continue the attacks until a \"complete and permanent ceasefire\" is reached in Gaza.\n\nLast month, the IDF formally \"authorized and validated\" operational plans for a campaign aimed at pushing Hezbollah north of the Litani River, which was also the stated goal of 2006's UNSC Resolution 1701. The government is considering launching the operation as early as this month, Germany's Bild reported on Tuesday, citing diplomatic sources.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops in the south that the IDF is \"striking Hezbollah very hard every day, and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength.\"\n\nTanks currently leaving the Gaza Strip \"can reach as far as the Litani,\" he stated, in reference to the river some 10 miles north of the Israeli border.\n\n\"We prefer a deal, but if reality forces us, we will know how to fight,\" concluded Gallant, according to a readout from his office.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt acknowledged on Wednesday that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours later, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nThe U.S. and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiraling into an all-out war, which they fear could spillover across the region.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain displaced due to the violence.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to continue the attacks until a \"complete and permanent ceasefire\" is reached in Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops in the south that the IDF is \"striking Hezbollah very hard every day, and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength.\"\n\nTanks currently leaving the Gaza Strip \"can reach as far as the Litani,\" he stated, in reference to the Lebanese river some 10 miles north of the Israeli border.\n\n\"We prefer a deal, but if reality forces us, we will know how to fight,\" concluded Gallant, according to a readout from his office.\n\nLast month, the IDF formally \"authorized and validated\" operational plans for a campaign aimed at pushing Hezbollah north of the Litani, in accordance with 2006's U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War.\n\nJerusalem is considering launching the operation as early as this month, Germany's Bild reported on Tuesday, citing diplomatic

His death came after an Israeli strike in June killed Taleb Abdallah, who headed another sector.\n\nSpeaking at Nasser's funeral, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned Israel against \"imagining that targeting these heroes would ever leave the south exposed\".\n\n\"When any leader becomes a martyr, another takes up the banner and proceeds with new, firm and strong resolve.\"\n\nHeavy battles rock Gaza\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nThe Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.\n\nThe Gaza war at the heart of the tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day today.\n\nIsraeli troops \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" the military said.\n\nGaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\nEfforts towards truce\n\nIsrael has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.\n\nThe UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week truce and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThere has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.\n\nHamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had \"made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement\".\n\nNetanyahu's office said Wednesday that \"Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators\".\n\nThe main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting, which Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners strongly reject. - AFP", "source": {"uri": "theborneopost.com", "dataType":

It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nThe US and France are continuing to scramble to prevent the skirmishes from spiralling into an all-out war, which they fear could spillover across the region.\n\nThe relatively low-level conflict erupted shortly after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its October 7 attack into southern Israel.\n\nThe fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Another border sector chief was killed in an Israeli strike last month.\n\nHezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy\" it had fired \"more than 200 rockets\" and \"a squadron of explosive drones\" at Israeli bases.\n\nAir raid sirens blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted.\n\n- Heavy battles rock Gaza -\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nThe Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nMore from this section CDC issues extreme heat safety tips as heat waves roll in nationwide Four lost pregnancies. Five weeks of IVF injections. One storm. Wilson, at 16, becomes youngest male USA track Olympian\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.\n\nThe Gaza war at the heart of the regional tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and artillery shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day on Thursday.\n\nIsraeli troops over the past day had \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" said the military.\n\nGaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in Gaza's southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\nWitnesses reported air strikes and intense artillery shelling in western Rafah on Thursday.\n\n- Efforts towards truce -\n\nIsrael has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.\n\nThe UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week again called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week ceasefire and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nThere has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.\n\nHamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had \"made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement\".\n\nNetanyahu's office and the Mossad intelligence service said \"Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators\".\n\nThe main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting -- a demand Netanyahu and his right-wing nationalist government allies strongly reject.\n\nburs/fz/ami", "source": {"uri":

The person said the response remained in line with Hamas's longstanding demands for a ceasefire, an Israeli troop withdrawal and the return of displaced civilians.\n\nIf those demands remain intact, the negotiations are likely to continue to falter. Israel has so far resisted withdrawing its troops from Gaza, arguing it won't stop its fight until Hamas is eradicated. Netanyahu's government has also only committed so far to the idea of a temporary ceasefire as a way to release hostages seized after Hamas fighters attacked the country's south on 7 October.\n\nThat attack by Hamas, which is labelled a terrorist group by the US and the European Union, provoked an Israel military campaign that has killed some 37,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health authority in Gaza, and provoked a humanitarian crisis there. Mediators from Qatar and Egypt -- with help from the US -- have worked in recent weeks to forge a proposal that both sides could accept, without success so far.\n\nPresident Joe Biden joined those efforts in late May when he announced a three-phase proposal that would chart a path toward an end to the war. He said from the start that Israel had agreed and the holdup was Hamas, even as Israeli officials hedged on their commitment to support his idea.\n\nThe push to forge a ceasefire has gained new urgency with fears growing that Israel is lurching toward a full-blown war with Hezbollah fighters across its northern border in Lebanon.\n\nIsrael's military killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an air strike after targeting his vehicle in south Lebanon, adding to already intensifying hostilities.\n\nThe head of the militant group's Aziz unit, a regional division in the southern sector, was hit while travelling in the Hosh area in Tyre, Al-Jadeed television said on Wednesday. Hezbollah confirmed one of its commanders, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, was killed by Israel.\n\nIsrael has killed hundreds of members of the Iran-backed militia, including other senior figures, since the two sides began exchanging near-daily cross-border fire in October. The simmering conflict has raised fears of an all-out war that could draw in Tehran and other regional powers, and countries including the US are working to prevent an escalation.\n\nIsrael took responsibility for the strike that killed Nasser, saying he led the firing of rockets and anti-tank missiles from southwestern Lebanon toward Israeli civilians and communities. Hezbollah responded to the assassination with the launch of dozens of rockets into northern Israel.\n\n\"Nasser directed a large number of terror attacks toward Israel both during and before the war,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a post on Telegram.\n\nHezbollah has been firing missiles into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. Israel has responded with strikes in Lebanon.\n\n\"We are hitting Hezbollah very hard every day and we will be fully prepared to carry out any action required in Lebanon or reach an agreement -- from a position of strength,\" said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. \"We prefer the latter, but if reality forces us, we will know how to fight.\"\n\nA month ago, Hezbollah escalated its attacks against Israel after the killing of a senior military commander, Taleb Abdullah. The Associated Press said Nasser was the most senior official from Hezbollah to have been killed since Abdullah.\n\nIsrael wants Hezbollah fighters to retreat at least 10km from the border, a move that could allow Netanyahu's government to bring back thousands who were evacuated from the northern front at the start of the conflict in Gaza.\n\nOn the Lebanese side of the border, thousands have fled and Israeli strikes have levelled neighborhoods in border villages. Lebanon is still reeling under an economic and financial meltdown that started nearly four years ago and a war on its soil could spell more devastation.\n\nThe group has said that -- while it doesn't want a war with Israel -- it is ready for one. An Iranian official told the Financial Times this week that Tehran would support Hezbollah directly and via other allied militias in the region in the event of a full-blown conflict.\n\nSome of the world's biggest oil-hauling supertankers are instead loading up vast volumes of diesel in the latest sign of how attacks by Yemen's Houthis are upending global shipping.\n\nAt least one so-called very large crude carrier, or VLCC, capable of hauling two million barrels of oil, was already sailing from the Middle East to Europe, while another is in the process of loading, according to Kpler and ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAt least five more were expected to switch to carrying so-called clean petroleum product, a category that includes diesel, said shipbroker Braemar. That would mean about 14 million barrels of the fuel could end up on the huge ships.\n\nThe switchover has been at least partly a knock-on effect of Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that have upended some longstanding trade routes.\n\nThe incidents boosted earnings for smaller vessels that haul fuels like petrol and diesel -- known in industry jargon as clean tankers -- as the ships sail thousands of kilometres extra around Africa. At the same time, benchmark crude tanker rates have been easing, giving shipowners an incentive to switch their vessels out of that trade.\n\nAttacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants on the Red Sea have reinvigorated piracy networks in Somalia, with criminal groups growing in both number and force, a European naval commander said.\n\nThe Yemen-based Houthis began attacking vessels in the Red Sea last year to pressure Israel and its allies over the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nTheir campaign has roiled global shipping, forcing many vessels to sail thousands of kilometres around southern Africa instead.\n\nPirates \"think there is a window of opportunity due to the Houthis' presence\", with increased traffic along Somalia's coast and the pirates venturing further out into the Indian Ocean, said Vice-Admiral Ignacio Villanueva, who commands a European Union operation tasked with curbing piracy. \"They are really trying to stretch the Western, international operations' limits and capabilities.\"\n\nOne of the tactics being used by the pirates is to hijack smaller boats such as skiffs or dhows and travel for about 10 days into the middle of the Indian Ocean where they attempt to attack bigger ships, said Villanueva. About 10 of the recent attacks were carried out on large vessels, while a ransom fee was paid on one occasion, he said.\n\nThe increasing number of attacks were being carried out by groups that were \"well armed, organised and bigger in numbers\" than ever before, he said.\n\n\"We are encountering 25 or 30 pirates on the same attack,\" Villanueva said. \"They are very well coordinated with satellite phones and heavy weapons.\"\n\nThere had been 30 attacks on commercial vessels, fishing boats and dhows since November, he said. Recent incidents include hostages being taken in December on board the Malta-flagged MV Ruen, which led to Indian, Japanese and Spanish warships rescuing its 18 crew members. That was the first successful hijacking of a vessel off the Somali coast since 2017, according to the International Maritime Bureau.

Hezbollah retaliated swiftly with the firing of approximately 100 katyusha rockets aimed at Israeli military positions, marking a dramatic escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two adversaries.\n\nAlso Read | Python Swallows Woman After Crushing Her to Death in Indonesia, Husband Kills Giant Snake to Retrieve Body; Chilling Details Emerge.\n\nThe announcement of Nasser's death was made via Hezbollah's official channel on Telegram, although specific details about the location of the attack were not disclosed initially. Sources close to the group later confirmed to media outlets that Nasser had been killed in the Hosh area of Tyre, a city in southern Lebanon known for its historical significance and proximity to the Israeli border, according to AL Jazeera.\n\nNasser held a senior rank within Hezbollah, comparable to that of Taleb Abdallah, another prominent commander who was killed in a previous Israeli attack in June. The loss of such high-ranking officials underscores the intensity and strategic significance of the conflict, which has been ongoing for nearly nine months and has seen periodic flare-ups leading to concerns about broader regional instability.\n\nAlso Read | Delhi: PWD Minister Atishi Inspects Centralised Monsoon Control Room To Assess Waterlogging Situation in National Capital (See Pics and Video).\n\nIsraeli military officials acknowledged targeting Nasser, describing him as a key figure responsible for Hezbollah's operations involving anti-tank and rocket systems in southwestern Lebanon. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have maintained a stance of pre-emptive strikes against Hezbollah positions, citing security concerns and the need to protect Israeli territory from potential attacks.\n\nIn response to the escalating violence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasised the need for heightened security measures in northern Israel, where communities have faced increased threats from Hezbollah's rocket fire.\n\nNetanyahu's government has faced pressure from within Israel, with calls from some far-right ministers for a full-scale invasion of Hezbollah-controlled territory in Lebanon--a move that could escalate the conflict further and potentially lead to broader regional implications.\n\nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, known for his fiery rhetoric and staunch defence of the group's military actions, has warned of readiness for an all-out war with Israel, characterized by unrestricted warfare and a willingness to engage without restraint. Nasrallah's statements have been consistent with Hezbollah's longstanding position of preparedness against what it perceives as Israeli aggression and threats to Lebanon's sovereignty.\n\nThe recent exchanges of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel have prompted international concern, with diplomatic efforts underway to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been vocal in his calls for de-escalation, urging Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to avoid actions that could ignite a broader conflict detrimental to both Lebanese and Israeli interests.\n\nMacron \"reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel ... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel,\" the French presidency said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, United States Envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts in Lebanon, is coordinating with French counterparts to seek avenues for mediation and ceasefire negotiations. The United States, along with European and Arab states, has a vested interest in stabilizing the situation and preventing a wider regional conflagration that could have far-reaching consequences beyond Lebanon and Israel.\n\nAmidst the diplomatic manoeuvring and military engagements, the civilian toll continues to mount on both sides.\n\nLebanese authorities report that over 543 people, including 88 civilians, have been killed by Israeli attacks since the conflict intensified. In Israel, at least 21 people, including 10 civilians, have lost their lives due to Hezbollah's rocket fire and other attacks targeting civilian areas, Al Jazeera reported.

Most of the attacks began around ten in the morning and continued throughout the day. They also mostly involved the use of drones, which have become one of the main Hezbollah weapons in its arsenal since the October 7 war began and Hezbollah chose to begin attacks on Israel.\n\nHezbollah claimed, via Iranian media, that it had \"launched a barrage of rockets at several Israeli military positions in response to the regime's killing of one of its commanders in southern Lebanon.\" It said that that it targeted \"five Israeli military positions, including 100 Katyushas that targeted the headquarters of the Golan Division as well as Israel's air and missile systems at Nafah Base,\" Iran's IRNA reported.\n\nHezbollah calls this a retaliation for Israel killing Muhammad Nimah Nasser, known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\", on Wednesday. He is the second high level Hezbollah commander killed in the last month. Another one was killed on June 12. Hezbollah responded in June by firing up to 215 rockets and projectiles at northern Israel.\n\nHezbollah members of parliament have said the retaliation against Israel will increase. \"Hassan Fadlallah [a member of Lebanon's parliament for Hezbollah] stressed that Hezbollah's punitive response will come, and the enemy should realize that the resistance front has the upper hand,\" IRNA reported. Hezbollah continues to warn Israel about launching a large military operation in Lebanon. Iran has also issued warning about the chances of an escalating war.\n\nClearly Iran and Hezbollah do not want a larger war, because Iran wants to preserve Hezbollah so it can use it against Israel. Hezbollah has accomplished many of its aims over nine months of attacks. It has depopulated areas in northern Israel, including Kiryat Shmona, an unprecedented \"success\", in the eyes of Hezbollah.\n\nA recent article at the Iranian state media IRNA, which reprints Hezbollah claims, noted that Israelis who left the north in October due to the attacks have become \"refugees\" in hotels in Israel. This is Iran and Hezbollah's plan. Their plan does not want a major war because they are concerned about the damage Hezbollah will suffer.\n\nHezbollah's true message\n\nThe message from Hezbollah is clear from its attacks. It used drones in many incidents on Wednesday between 10am and noon, targeting an increasingly large area between the Sea of Galilee and Metulla. This including numerous sirens in the Golan and also in the Huleh valley. These included the communities that overlook the Huleh such as Shamir and Gonen. It also included Katzrin in the Golan. At 11:23am the area of Hezbollah attacks expanded to target Nahariya, and communities along the coast as well as further inland.\n\nHezbollah's message is clear. It has the large drone arsenal and also rocket and missile arsenal to chose where and when to attack. It has leaned into its drone arsenal over the last months, increasing its use of drones. This is because drones can be precise and effective and also they cause sirens in wide areas. Hezbollah can then achieve a multi-pronged list of what it sees as \"successes.\" It can target Israeli areas with precision, as well as cause civilian areas to be forced into shelters through sirens. Hezbollah often relies on Israeli media to bolster its sense of accomplishment. It will sometimes seek to launder news through foreign media and then re-report its won \"success\" via Al-Mayadeen in order to make its claims seem more legitimate.\n\nThe point here is that Hezbollah's claims alone do not make them true, but it thinks it makes it seem more accurate if it can get others to re-report its claims. Therefore the increase in attacks in retaliation for the killing of the commander will also be waged online and on media. For instance Al-Mayadeen reported that Israel's Haaretz had said there are \"difficult days\" ahead now after the killing of Nasser in Lebanon. It remains to be seen if this is something Hezbollah actually has in store at the moment or if the retaliation will subside after a day.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hula Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Mayadeen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Mayadeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shamir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yitzhak Shamir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea of Galilee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haaretz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metula", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metula"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Metula"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahariya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nahariya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nahariya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/607240", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 59, "textEnd": 65}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 275, "textEnd": 284}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 989, "textEnd": 996}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

His death came after an Israeli strike in June killed Taleb Abdallah, who headed another sector.\n\nSpeaking at Nasser's funeral, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned Israel against \"imagining that targeting these heroes would ever leave the south exposed\".\n\n\"When any leader becomes a martyr, another takes up the banner and proceeds with new, firm and strong resolve.\"\n\n- Heavy battles rock Gaza -\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nThe Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.\n\nThe Gaza war at the heart of the tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day on Thursday.\n\nIsraeli troops \"destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,\" the military said.\n\nGaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.\n\nFears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.\n\n- Efforts towards truce -\n\nIsrael has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.\n\nThe UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week called for an end to the \"maelstrom of human misery\".\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week truce and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThere has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.\n\nHamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had \"made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement\".\n\nNetanyahu's office said Wednesday that \"Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators\".\n\nThe main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting, which Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners strongly reject.\n\nburs/fz/kir\n\nMore from this section\n\niMyFone

Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain displaced due to the violence.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to continue the attacks until a \"complete and permanent ceasefire\" is reached in Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops in the south that the IDF is \"striking Hezbollah very hard every day, and we will also reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength.\"\n\nTanks currently leaving the Gaza Strip \"can reach as far as the Litani,\" he stated, in reference to the Lebanese river some 10 miles north of the Israeli border.\n\n\"We prefer a deal, but if reality forces us, we will know how to fight,\" concluded Gallant, according to a readout from his office.\n\nLast month, the IDF formally \"authorized and validated\" operational plans for a campaign aimed at pushing Hezbollah north of the Litani, in accordance with 2006's U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War.\n\nJerusalem is considering launching the operation as early as this month, Germany's Bild reported on Tuesday, citing diplomatic sources.\n\nRepublished with permission from Jewish News Syndicate", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Israeli military confirmed it was responsible for the airstrike.\n\nIran-backed Hezbollah has traded near daily cross-border fire with the Israeli army since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, triggering war in Gaza, but an uptick in bellicose rhetoric from both sides in recent weeks has raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHezbollah responded to the killing of Naameh Nasser by firing 100 rockets at Israel.\n\nNasser is the third senior Hezbollah commander to be killed in almost nine months of hostilities.\n\nLebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said \"an enemy drone targeted a car\" in Tyre, a coastal city about 12 miles from the border.\n\nThe first source said Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, a commander killed in an Israeli strike last month who was described by a Lebanese military source at the time as the \"most important\" Hezbollah commander killed to date.\n\nThat strike prompted Hezbollah to intensify its attacks on Israeli targets, firing barrages of rockets across the border in the days that followed.\n\nIn January, a security source said an Israeli strike killed Wissam Hassan Tawil, another top commander from the group.\n\nHezbollah announced a series of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Wednesday, while the NNA reported Israeli attacks in other parts of south Lebanon.\n\nThe commander's death followed a relative easing of cross-border exchanges over the past week, after threats on both sides had intensified.\n\nFears the violence, so far largely restricted to the border area, could turn into all-out war have sparked a flurry of diplomatic efforts to lower tensions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, urged Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a \"conflagration\" between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made repeated visits to Lebanon in recent months, was due in Paris on Wednesday where he was expected to meet with Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nIran warned on Saturday that \"all resistance fronts\" would confront Israel if it attacks Lebanon.\n\nLast week, Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister, said his country did not want war in Lebanon but could send it back to the \"Stone Age\" if diplomacy failed.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, the chief of Hezbollah, warned in June that \"no place\" in Israel would be spared in the event of all-out war, and threatened nearby Cyprus if it opened its airports to Israel.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 495 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to AFP, while Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

He would be the highest-ranking Hezbollah member killed in an attack in nearly a month.\n\nAfter Nasser's death, a video was released from 1999 when southern Lebanon was facing an Israeli occupation. The footage showed Nasser taking part in an operation against one of the Israeli military outposts.\n\nThe Aziz Unit is responsible for operations in one of the segments of the southern Lebanon border area. There are three such units, all of which have been engaged in tit-for-tat attacks against neighboring Israel.\n\nHezbollah responded to the death by firing an estimated 100 Katyusha rockets against the headquarters of Israel's Air Defense and Missile Unit in the occupied Golan Heights. They also fired heavier Falaq rockets at the Kiryat Shmona barracks.\n\nThe attacks come amid growing concern that escalating attacks by both sides is leading to full-scale war along the border. The international community has been pushing for a diplomatic solution that would move Hezbollah away from the border in return for an end to Israeli airstrikes on the country.\n\nReports are that Israel has set the second half of July for the timing of a new offensive against Lebanon. Hezbollah has conditioned an end to their strikes on a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Hezbollah retaliated swiftly with the firing of approximately 100 katyusha rockets aimed at Israeli military positions, marking a dramatic escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two adversaries.\n\nThe announcement of Nasser's death was made via Hezbollah's official channel on Telegram, although specific details about the location of the attack were not disclosed initially. Sources close to the group later confirmed to media outlets that Nasser had been killed in the Hosh area of Tyre, a city in southern Lebanon known for its historical significance and proximity to the Israeli border, according to AL Jazeera.\n\nNasser held a senior rank within Hezbollah, comparable to that of Taleb Abdallah, another prominent commander who was killed in a previous Israeli attack in June. The loss of such high-ranking officials underscores the intensity and strategic significance of the conflict, which has been ongoing for nearly nine months and has seen periodic flare-ups leading to concerns about broader regional instability.\n\nIsraeli military officials acknowledged targeting Nasser, describing him as a key figure responsible for Hezbollah's operations involving anti-tank and rocket systems in southwestern Lebanon. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have maintained a stance of pre-emptive strikes against Hezbollah positions, citing security concerns and the need to protect Israeli territory from potential attacks.\n\nIn response to the escalating violence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasised the need for heightened security measures in northern Israel, where communities have faced increased threats from Hezbollah's rocket fire.\n\nNetanyahu's government has faced pressure from within Israel, with calls from some far-right ministers for a full-scale invasion of Hezbollah-controlled territory in Lebanon--a move that could escalate the conflict further and potentially lead to broader regional implications.\n\nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, known for his fiery rhetoric and staunch defence of the group's military actions, has warned of readiness for an all-out war with Israel, characterized by unrestricted warfare and a willingness to engage without restraint. Nasrallah's statements have been consistent with Hezbollah's longstanding position of preparedness against what it perceives as Israeli aggression and threats to Lebanon's sovereignty.\n\nThe recent exchanges of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel have prompted international concern, with diplomatic efforts underway to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been vocal in his calls for de-escalation, urging Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to avoid actions that could ignite a broader conflict detrimental to both Lebanese and Israeli interests.\n\nMacron \"reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel ... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel,\" the French presidency said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, United States Envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts in Lebanon, is coordinating with French counterparts to seek avenues for mediation and ceasefire negotiations. The United States, along with European and Arab states, has a vested interest in stabilizing the situation and preventing a wider regional conflagration that could have far-reaching consequences beyond Lebanon and Israel.\n\nAmidst the diplomatic manoeuvring and military engagements, the civilian toll continues to mount on both sides.\n\nLebanese authorities report that over 543 people, including 88 civilians, have been killed by Israeli attacks since the conflict intensified. In Israel, at least 21 people, including 10 civilians, have lost their lives due to Hezbollah's rocket fire and other attacks targeting civilian areas, Al Jazeera reported.

Inside Israel, it's a different story; many Israelis believe another war with Hezbollah is inevitable, if not long overdue given the security environment Israel has faced since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack undermined the IDF's perceived invincibility. The IDF have already approved plans for an offensive in Lebanon, and the language from some Israeli officials, including Gantz, suggests an operation will occur sooner or later. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, stressed over the weekend that more Israeli reservists will be deployed to the north as operations in Gaza wind down.\n\nIt's a stark departure from where much of the international community stands. On June 21, U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told the U.N. Security Council, \"The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.\" Days later, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reiterated to reporters at the Pentagon, \"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war with terrible consequences for the Middle East.\" Ditto German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, whose own rhetoric during a recent trip to Israel and Lebanon was nearly identical to America's top defense official: \"Another war would mean a regional escalation on a scale we can hardly imagine.\"\n\nWashington, for its part, has tried to prevent war in Lebanon by catering its messages depending on the audience. To Hezbollah, the Biden administration is making it plain that, while the U.S.-Israel relationship is tight, it can't control Israel and it would therefore be wise for the U.S.-designated terrorist group to start cooperating on a diplomatic way out. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to stress to Israel that, although it opposes a war, Washington will have Israel's back come hell or high water.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, though, needs to start getting real with Israel. Right now the administration is trying to have it both ways by stressing just how awful an Israel-Hezbollah war would be while echoing that the U.S.'s support is automatic regardless of what Israel decides to do. This is likely to embolden, not discourage, Netanyahu. And it's a dangerous approach. What the U.S. should be doing instead is making it known to Israeli officials, both publicly and privately, that the U.S. doesn't support a war in Lebanon and won't bail it out if it initiates one.\n\nYet just because something is a terrible idea doesn't necessarily mean it will be avoided. Israel and Hezbollah, two archenemies that have engaged in multiple armed confrontations over the last four decades, are in essence already in a war. Ever since Oct. 8, a day after Hamas' deadly assault into southern Israel, the IDF and Hezbollah have turned the Israeli-Lebanese border region into their own personal firing range. Hezbollah has launched more than 5,000 anti-tank rockets, drones and missiles against various Israeli targets in the north of the country. Israel, in turn, has conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah positions nearly every day, killing high-ranking field commanders in the process. Nearly 350 Hezbollah fighters have been killed to date, a toll that surpasses the group's casualty numbers during the 2006 Second Lebanon War. At the time of writing, Israel has registered a total of 25 deaths, 15 military and 10 civilian, on that front.\n\nFor most of the last eight months, the violence has been relatively contained to within approximately 3.5 miles of the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line, the unofficial boundary between Israel and Lebanon. The fact that tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border were evacuated allowed to keep civilian casualties to a minimum. Yet Israel and Hezbollah's rhetoric, in addition to deeper Israeli airstrikes into Lebanon and Hezbollah's use of more sophisticated weapons like precision-guided munitions and drones -- one of which injured 18 Israeli troops this weekend -- are a bad omen for averting an escalation that the Biden administration is working desperately to prevent.\n\nDespite Gantz's aggressive language, there is some truth to it. Outside of the United States military, the IDF is still the region's most powerful military force. If Israel can turn Gaza into a wasteland of rubber and rebar, it can certainly do the same thing in Lebanon. This isn't supposition but fact; Israel has invaded or bombed Lebanon so many times over the preceding decades (1978, 1982, 1993, 1996 and 2006) that it's difficult to keep track. The 1982 invasion, which aimed to disband Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization for good, was especially deadly for the country, caused considerable friction with the United States and resulted in a nearly two decade-long occupation that created the very terrorist organization -- Hezbollah -- Israel is now seeking to deter.\n\nThe 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war was deadly as well. Approximately 1,200 Lebanese lost their lives, as did 158 Israelis (the vast majority of whom were soldiers. Much of Lebanon's public infrastructure, including the Beirut International Airport, was bombed. Even so, a new war with Hezbollah would make the 2006 conflict look tame in comparison. The 2006 war was a tactical success but a strategical failure for Israel, as it destroyed a decent chunk of Hezbollah's offensive military capabilities but jeopardized Israel's international reputation. The Lebanese militia was bloodied but not destroyed.\n\nThe Hezbollah of 2024 is larger, better armed, more experienced and more politically powerful today than the Hezbollah of 2006. The group continues to boast its insurgent roots but increasingly resembles an army, possessing as many as 200,000 rockets and missiles of various ranges. Some of those missiles can reach any point in Israel, which means that, in the event of a war, Israel's critical civilian infrastructure -- airports, ports, electrical networks and power plants -- could be targeted. Millions of Israelis would be living in bomb-shelters as the country's major cities, from Tel Aviv to Haifa, are subjected to barrages that the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system would have a tough time neutralizing. Israeli ground forces, meanwhile, would be fighting against an organization that learned a great deal about military tactics, processes and procedures after years of ground operations in Syria, where Hezbollah proved crucial in saving Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from becoming the Syrian version of Muammar al-Qaddafi. In short, Israel would be acting against an adversary that is not only the Middle East's strongest non-state actor but one that frankly fights more effectively than most of the region's regular armies.\n\nThe main motivation behind a hypothetical Israeli offensive is to allow its people to return to their homes. This is both a humanitarian and political imperative -- humanitarian because Israelis, like people anywhere else, have the right to live in peace; political because a lingering internal displacement crisis is embarrassing for Netanyahu, whose entire career is premised on claims that he is the one man who can assure Israel's security.\n\nYet it's hard to see how launching a full-scale war in Lebanon accomplishes this. Any war is going to produce tremendous materiel and physical damage, not only to the lives of ordinary civilians but also to the towns, small villages and kibbutzim that dot the Israeli side of the Israeli-Lebanese border. Israel's economy in the north would be even worse off than it is today as more Israelis pull out of the area for their own safety.\n\nIsrael has to think bigger. Any war with Hezbollah increases the risk of Iran or proxy militias in Syria, Iraq and Yemen escalating their own direct involvement. It's important to note that Hezbollah is Iran's most valued asset in the region, a group that is meant to not only tie Israel down but to deter Israel and the United States from taking military action against Iran itself. While Iranian intervention of some sort is not a guarantee, it's certainly possible if Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps believe it's necessary to preserve Hezbollah's longevity.\n\nU.S. forces deployed in Iraq and Syria wouldn't be out of the woods either; as demonstrated multiple times in the past, U.S. military outposts in both countries are opportunistic targets for Iran-backed militias who wish to send a message of disapproval about U.S. or Israeli policies. Although attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have largely subsided since the Biden administration bombed dozens of militia and IRGC-linked targets in February -- retaliation for a militia drone strike that killed three U.S. troops at a remote basis along the Syrian-Jordanian border -- nothing is permanent in the Middle East. U.S. officials will have to be aware that, in any Israel-Hezbollah war, there's a chance Americans wouldn't be immune from the fallout.\n\nThe Biden administration should keep this in mind and conduct itself wisely with Israel. The U.S. may not be able to control Israeli policy but it doesn't have to be trapped by it, either.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [],

Hezbollah retaliated swiftly with the firing of approximately 100 katyusha rockets aimed at Israeli military positions, marking a dramatic escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two adversaries.\n\nThe announcement of Nasser's death was made via Hezbollah's official channel on Telegram, although specific details about the location of the attack were not disclosed initially. Sources close to the group later confirmed to media outlets that Nasser had been killed in the Hosh area of Tyre, a city in southern Lebanon known for its historical significance and proximity to the Israeli border, according to AL Jazeera.\n\nNasser held a senior rank within Hezbollah, comparable to that of Taleb Abdallah, another prominent commander who was killed in a previous Israeli attack in June. The loss of such high-ranking officials underscores the intensity and strategic significance of the conflict, which has been ongoing for nearly nine months and has seen periodic flare-ups leading to concerns about broader regional instability.\n\nIsraeli military officials acknowledged targeting Nasser, describing him as a key figure responsible for Hezbollah's operations involving anti-tank and rocket systems in southwestern Lebanon. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have maintained a stance of pre-emptive strikes against Hezbollah positions, citing security concerns and the need to protect Israeli territory from potential attacks.\n\nIn response to the escalating violence, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasised the need for heightened security measures in northern Israel, where communities have faced increased threats from Hezbollah's rocket fire.\n\nNetanyahu's government has faced pressure from within Israel, with calls from some far-right ministers for a full-scale invasion of Hezbollah-controlled territory in Lebanon-a move that could escalate the conflict further and potentially lead to broader regional implications.\n\nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, known for his fiery rhetoric and staunch defence of the group's military actions, has warned of readiness for an all-out war with Israel, characterized by unrestricted warfare and a willingness to engage without restraint. Nasrallah's statements have been consistent with Hezbollah's longstanding position of preparedness against what it perceives as Israeli aggression and threats to Lebanon's sovereignty.\n\nThe recent exchanges of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel have prompted international concern, with diplomatic efforts underway to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been vocal in his calls for de-escalation, urging Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to avoid actions that could ignite a broader conflict detrimental to both Lebanese and Israeli interests.\n\nMacron \"reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel ... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel,\" the French presidency said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, United States Envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts in Lebanon, is coordinating with French counterparts to seek avenues for mediation and ceasefire negotiations. The United States, along with European and Arab states, has a vested interest in stabilizing the situation and preventing a wider regional conflagration that could have far-reaching consequences beyond Lebanon and Israel.\n\nAmidst the diplomatic manoeuvring and military engagements, the civilian toll continues to mount on both sides.\n\nLebanese authorities report that over 543 people, including 88 civilians, have been killed by Israeli attacks since the conflict intensified. In Israel, at least 21 people, including 10 civilians, have lost their lives due to Hezbollah's rocket fire and other attacks targeting civilian areas, Al Jazeera reported.

Several European nations have also advised their nationals to evacuate Lebanon.\n\nRecent weeks have witnessed escalating tit-for-tat strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border, with Israeli attacks extending deeper into Lebanese territory and increasing in frequency. (Related: Israel OKs plans for ALL-OUT WAR in Lebanon to wipe out Hezbollah.)\n\nThe Pentagon anticipates a potential escalation and has positioned U.S. military assets closer to Israel and Lebanon. This includes deploying the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship and Marines from the 24th Expeditionary Unit into the eastern Mediterranean. Their readiness is aimed at supporting Military Assisted Departure operations and other contingencies.\n\nSimultaneously, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are conducting extensive drills along the northern border with Lebanon.\n\nThese drills, which involve combat simulations and strategic planning, have been intensified following Israeli government approval of potential war plans against Hezbollah.\n\nThe IDF's maneuvers include scenarios of a broader offensive response to ongoing Hezbollah drone and rocket launches into northern Israel.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

The presence of units like the 55th Reserve Paratroopers Brigade underscores Israel's preparation for significant military actions, potentially including operations in southern Lebanon.\n\nThis military buildup and the strategic movements of both U.S. and Israeli forces indicate a heightened state of readiness amid concerns over a possible escalation in hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, with implications for regional stability and international security.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran has issued a stark warning to Israel against potential full-scale military actions in Lebanon, cautioning that such actions could escalate into a devastating conflict, as conveyed by Iran's United Nations mission.\n\nThe mission stated that all options, including full engagement of various resistance groups aligned with Iran across the region, are on the table.\n\nDescribing Israel's threats against Hezbollah in Lebanon as psychological warfare and propaganda, the mission emphasized the gravity of the situation along the border, which has witnessed daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah since the onset of the Gaza conflict on October 7.\n\nTensions escalated notably when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated preparations for what he termed \"a very tense operation\" along the Lebanese border.\n\nShortly thereafter, Israeli warplanes conducted a series of attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, including military sites and infrastructure facilities, according to reports from the Israeli Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant clarified that while Israel prefers a political resolution, it remains prepared for all scenarios, including conflict with Hezbollah. He underscored Israel's military readiness and capability to inflict significant damage on Lebanon if war were to break out.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah responded to the escalating tensions by warning of an unrestrained and unbounded war in case of a major Israeli offensive against Lebanon, stating that there would be \"no restraint, no rules and no ceilings\" in such a conflict.\n\nHead

This comes amid ongoing border skirmishes since the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war on Gaza, which has killed at least 37,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in over 400 deaths and 90,000 displacements in Lebanon, with 25 deaths and 60,000 displacements in Israel.

Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Al-Raheb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Al-Raheb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-surface_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-surface missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galilee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanese Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eilat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eilat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nNaameh is the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a speech honoring Abdullah said he played a pivotal role on the front line since clashes began on October 8 leading the Nasr Unit.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the attack.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets on northern Israel a day after a Hamas surprise attack on southern Israel in October, leading to limited clashes along the tense border. The attacks have since gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nThe group maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says it will continue with its attacks to pile pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation should Hezbollah not stop its attacks.\n\nHezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that Israel cannot expect the group's attacks to remain limited should it launch a military operation within Lebanon, even if it aims to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Allies, including thousands of Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq, have offered to join Hezbollah on the front lines.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nSenior adviser to US President Joe Biden, Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling between Lebanon and Israel, is set to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian in Paris on Wednesday as part of his ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.",

Cross-border exchanges of fire have intensified, and Israeli officials have publicly spoken of shifting their military focus from Hamas in the Gaza Strip to Hezbollah, a far more advanced and potent threat.\n\nAmos Hochstein, a senior White House adviser who has become the de facto U.S. envoy in tamping down the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, conferred on Wednesday with French officials in Paris to discuss how to defuse the rising tensions. Jean-Yves Le Drian, President Emmanuel Macron's special envoy to Lebanon, was among the people with whom he met, according to a person close to the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.\n\nThe Israeli military said its drone strike had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, also known as Abu Naameh, who was among the highest-ranking Hezbollah fighters to die in nearly nine months of conflict, according to a senior Lebanese intelligence official, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue. He said Mr. Nasser had led Hezbollah's Aziz unit, one of the group's main fighting forces along the Lebanese border.\n\nHezbollah confirmed his death, and though it did not explicitly say how he had died, the group said it had fired 100 rockets at military targets over the border as part of an \"initial response,\" setting off sirens in communities across northern Israel. The Israeli military said that most of that barrage had fallen in open areas, but Hezbollah continued to claim retaliatory attacks into the evening.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Iraq_(2013\u20132017)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Iraq (2013\u20132017)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Yves_Le_Drian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Yves Le Drian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/03/multimedia/03mideast-crisis-ledeall-1-kpml/03mideast-crisis-ledeall-1-kpml-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel\u00b4s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April - earlier than the usual fire season - and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nFILE - A plane uses a fire retardant to extinguish a fire burning in an area near the border with Lebanon, in Safed, northern Israel, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

(AP Photo/Leo Correa, File)\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon\u00b4s southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men - some using their shirts to beat out flames - stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We\u00b4ll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area - captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel\u00b4s second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars - the largest a few hundred square meters - remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel\u00b4s Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn\u00b4t expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people - mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants - have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel\u00b4s Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month - nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel\u00b4s Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we\u00b4re alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael\u00b4s cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that\u00b4s what creates the damage,\" he said.\n\nLidman reported from northern Israel.\n\nFILE - Smoke rises to the sky as a fire burns an area after a Lebanese shelling, in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, Thursday, June 13, 2024.

Harrison Mann.\n\nHarrison Mann, the US army Major who resigned over the Gaza war, says \"Israel\" risks a disastrous war against Hezbollah for political reasons.\n\nWhen he resigned in protest over the US support for \"Israel\", he described months of being increasingly disturbed by the images and news of Israel's U.S.-backed bombardment of Gaza, which culminated in his public resignation from his position at the Defense Intelligence Agency to avoid further complicity in Israel's \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinians.\n\nDuring an interview with The Guardian, Mann said, \"We know specifically that the Israeli prime minister must continue to be a wartime leader if he wants to prolong his political career and stay out of court, so that motivation is there.\"\n\nHe maintained that \"Israel\" was fully aware that preemptive strikes against Hezbollah's lethal arsenal would be ineffective since the rockets, missiles, and artillery were sunk into the hilly Lebanese topography.\n\nInstead, he stressed how he thinks \"we can be very comfortable assessing that bombing civilian centers as a way to compel the enemy is clearly an accepted and shared belief in the IDF and Israeli leadership. We've just seen them do it in Gaza for the past nine months.\"\n\nHowever, he pointed to what he called \"limits of strategic thinking and planning,\" as such a plan would backfire since Hezbollah would unleash a barrage of missiles in response.\n\nHe noted that Hezbollah has the \"ability to at least partially overwhelm Israel's air defenses, strike civilian infrastructure around the country, and inflict a level of destruction on Israel that I'm not sure Israel has really ever experienced in its history - certainly not in its recent history.\"\n\nUnable to eliminate Hezbollah's weapons in the air, the IOF would undertake a land attack into southern Lebanon, resulting in scores of Israeli casualties, Mann warned. He speculated that the shelling of Israeli-occupied territories would subsequently force the US under Israeli pressure to become more involved.\n\n'Israel' is preparing for offensive on Lebanon in July\n\n\"Israel\" claims it will begin an offensive operation on Lebanon in the second half of July unless Hezbollah ceases its fire, the German Bild reported on Monday, citing diplomatic sources.\n\nHezbollah has repeatedly said it will not halt its attacks unless \"Israel\" ends its ongoing genocide in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah and \"Israel\" have been at war since October 8, a day after Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel killing 1139 people and taking over 250 hostages\n\nDespite the United States' support for \"Israel\", the Biden administration has strongly urged it not to go to war with Lebanon, since it would be catastrophic for both sides and could potentially ignite a regional war.\n\nFormer Iranian FM and Head of Iran's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations Kamal Kharraz said i in an interview with the Financial Times that if \"Israel\" launches an all-out war against Lebanon, it would risk triggering a regional war in which Tehran and the Axis of Resistance are prepared to support Hezbollah in Lebanon , with all means to confront the Israeli aggression.\n\nIn the interview, he explained that \"There would be a chance of expansion of the war to the whole region, in which all countries including Iran would become engaged,\" adding that \"in that situation, we would have no choice, but to support Hezbollah by all means.", "source": {"uri":

Hezbollah says it will stop its attacks once Israel agrees to a cease-fire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSome Israeli officials have said they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the standoff and hope to avoid war. At the same time, they have warned that the scenes of destruction seen in Gaza will be repeated in Lebanon if war breaks out. Hezbollah, meanwhile, is far more powerful than Hamas and believed to have a vast arsenal of rockets and missiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel.\n\nThe nearly nine-month war in Gaza has caused massive devastation across the besieged territory and displaced most of its 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel's military estimated Tuesday that around 1.9 million people -- more than 80% of all Palestinians in the Gaza Strip -- are now clustered into the territory's central region.\n\nEvacuees have been told by Israel to seek refuge in an overcrowded coastal area filled with sprawling tent camps where there are few basic services. Israeli restrictions, the ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order have curtailed humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine. The top U.N. court has concluded there is a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza -- a charge Israel strongly denies.\n\nIsrael launched the war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nSince then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,900 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Israel turbocharges West Bank settlement expansion with largest land grab in decades.\n\n-- Israeli strike kills another senior Hezbollah commander as diplomats scramble for calm in Lebanon.\n\n-- A strike kills a family in Gaza as an Israeli evacuation order sparks panicked flight from Khan Younis.\n\n-- Hezbollah's deputy leader says the group would stop fighting with Israel after a Gaza cease-fire.\n\n-- Lebanese authorities charge U.S. Embassy shooter with affiliation to militant Islamic State group.\n\n-- Iran's presidential candidates talk economic sanctions and nuclear deal ahead of their runoff election.\n\n-- Follow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nUN is talking with Israel about aid teams' communication needs in Gaza, but won't confirm reports about using Elon Musk's Starlink satellite service\n\nUNITED NATIONS - The United Nations says it's talking to Israel about its communications needs in Gaza and is looking for a system that doesn't rely on cellular networks.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told The Associated Press on Wednesday that communications \"are vital to the safety of our operations\" in Gaza, where war between Israel and Hamas has raged for nearly nine months.\n\nDujarric would not confirm a report in Axios that the U.N. and Israel are negotiating the deployment of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite service in Gaza.\n\n\"We are agnostic on the platform, we are looking to have some communications system that does not rely on cell towers,\" Dujarric said.\n\nAndrea De Domenico, head of the U.N. humanitarian office in Gaza and the West Bank, also didn't confirm the Axios report during a press conference with U.N. journalists earlier Wednesday from Jerusalem.\n\nBut he said: \"Communication equipment has been a longstanding request of the humanitarian community as a whole.\"\n\n\"It is very simple,\" De Domenic said. \"Every time there is a military operation, we lose completely communication with our teams.\"\n\nHe said the internet and simple phone connections are \"fundamental to the way we operaate and function in these days.\"\n\nDe Domenico said the U.N. needs ways to communicate with its teams to plan and conduct humanitarian operations, as well as to communicate with U.N. partners on the ground and the Israeli military to make sure the operations can be carried out safely. He said he didn't care about the service -- as long as it works.\n\nHezbollah fires rocket barrages against Israeli military positions in retaliation for killing a senior commander\n\nBEIRUT -- The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it fired scores of rockets at Israeli military positions near the border on Wednesday in retaliation for Israel's killing a senior commander in a airstrike hours earlier.\n\nThe Israeli military estimated that around 100 rockets were fired, and said there were no reports of casualties.\n\nHezbollah said it launched Falaq rockets with heavy warheads targeting the headquarters of the Israeli military's 769th Brigade in Kiryat Shmona, as well as 100 salvos of Katyusha rockets targeting the headquarters of Israel's 210th division and the Kilaa air base in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\n\nLater, the group said it attacked the Zaarit barracks near the border with Burkan rockets, another type of rocket with heavy warheads like the Falaq.\n\nA Hezbollah statement identified the commander killed Wednesday as Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who went by the name \"Abu Naameh,\" his nom de guerre. He is the most senior leader from the group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" militants in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nInternational diplomats are scrambling to prevent the near-daily clashes between Israel and Hezbollah from spiraling into an all-out war that could possibly lead to a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran, which is Hezbollah's main backer. Hezbollah says it will stop its attacks once Israel agrees to a cease-fire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSome Israeli officials have said they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the standoff and hope to avoid war.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, is far more powerful than Hamas and believed to have a vast arsenal of rockets and missiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel.\n\nTens of thousands of people on both sides of the tense frontier have been displaced in the monthslong war.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 450 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.\n\nIsraeli strike kills another senior Hezbollah commander as diplomats scramble for calm in Lebanon\n\nBEIRUT -- An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed a senior Hezbollah commander on Wednesday as tensions between the two sides boil, a Hezbollah official told The Associated Press.\n\nThe strike near the southern coastal city of Tyre took place as global diplomatic efforts have intensified in recent weeks to prevent escalating clashes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military from spiraling into an all-out war that could possibly lead to a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran.\n\nA Hezbollah statement identified the commander as Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who went by the name \"Abu Naameh,\" his nom de guerre. A Hezbollah official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said Nasser was the head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nNasser was the most senior official from the Iran-backed group killed since Taleb Sami Abdullah, who was killed in an airstrike June 11.\n\nIn a video circulated by local media, residents rushed toward a charred vehicle with a large plume of smoke. Civil Defense said its first responders transported an unnamed wounded person to a hospital.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the attack, saying that Nasser alongside Abdullah are \"two of the most significant Hezbollah\" militants in southern Lebanon. It said Nasser led attacks from southwestern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah has launched rockets into northern Israel since a day after the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which sparked the war in Gaza. There have been limited clashes along the tense Israel-Lebanon border almost every day that have gradually escalated, with Hezbollah introducing new weapons in their attacks and Israel striking deeper into Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah maintains that it will stop its attacks once there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Until then, it says it will keep up the attacks to exert pressure on Israel and the international community. Israeli officials have threatened to launch a larger military operation if Hezbollah doesn't halt its attacks.\n\nAssociated Press writer Kareem Chehayeb contributed to this report.\n\nIsrael approved largest land seizure in West Bank in decades, watchdog says\n\nAn anti-settlement watchdog says Israel has approved the largest seizure of land in the occupied West Bank in over three decades.\n\nThe Israeli group Peace Now said Wednesday that authorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley. The group's data indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.\n\nThe land seizure, which was approved late last month but only publicized on Wednesday, comes after the seizure of 8 square kilometers (roughly 3 square miles) of land in the West Bank in March and 2.6 square kilometers (1 square mile) in February.\n\nThat makes 2024 by far the peak year for Israeli land seizure in the West Bank, Peace Now said.\n\nThe Palestinians view the expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank as the main barrier to any lasting peace agreement and most of the international community considers them illegal or illegitimate. Israel's government considers the West Bank to be the historical and religious heartland of the Jewish people and is opposed to Palestinian statehood.\n\n1 killed, another wounded in stabbing attack at northern Israel mall\n\nJERUSALEM -- One person was killed and another was wounded in a stabbing attack at a shopping mall in northern Israel in what Israeli police say was a terrorist attack.\n\nGal Zeid, the spokesperson for Israel's Galilee Medical Center, said doctors pronounced one man dead after failing to resuscitate him. He said another man was admitted to a hospital intensive care unit. The attack took place in the Israeli town of Karmiel.\n\nThe police say the assailant was killed. They did not provide details about the suspect.\n\nPalestinians have carried out a number of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks in Israel in recent years, while Israeli forces have launched frequent, deadly military raids in the occupied West Bank. Tensions have soared since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

He died in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a house in the town of Jouaiyya, about 15 km from the southern border. Three Hezbollah cadres were killed alongside him.\n\nThe intensity of Israeli attacks has fluctuated over the past few days. Attacks began on Wednesday morning with a combat drone shelling the town square in Taybeh. The border town of Kfarkela was subjected to Israeli artillery shelling at dawn, with an Israeli Merkava tank targeting a house near the border wall.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Mikati said: \"The Israeli attacks on the south and the deliberate killing of its people, the destruction of towns, and the burning of crops, are terrorist aggression; the international community must put an end to its persistence and crimes.\"\n\nHe reiterated his question to \"international stakeholders involved in initiatives\" about \"the steps taken to maintain calm, exercise restraint on the southern border, curb the enemy, and stop the approach of killing and destruction,\" noting \"the escalating Israeli violations of national sovereignty and its ongoing and extensive breach of UN Security Council Resolution 1701.\"\n\nMikati added: \"Lebanon's choice has always been and still is peace. Our culture is one of peace built on rights, justice, and international law, especially Resolution 1701. But we are a people who will not accept attacks on our sovereignty, national dignity, and the safety of our lands and civilians, especially children and women.\n\n\"Violations of all agreements and genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza must not go unnoticed by the world, which is passively watching the ongoing aggression.\"\n\nHe added: \"The essence of peace is for the Palestinian people to live on their land in a free and independent state, and any attempt to bypass these principles will lead to further crises in the Middle East and the world.\"\n\nLebanon is counting on the American-French initiative to prevent further escalation in the south of the country.\n\nA meeting is scheduled between Jean-Yves le Drian, the French envoy to Lebanon, and American envoy Amos Hochstein. This will focus on de-escalation as a solution to repatriating displaced persons on both sides of the Blue Line.\n\nOn the eve of Hochstein's arrival in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed in a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"the absolute importance\" of preventing an escalation of the situation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nA statement from the Elysee Palace said that Macron emphasized \"the urgent need for all parties to move quickly toward a diplomatic solution and stressed the necessity of exercising the utmost restraint.\" It added that during the phone call the two leaders discussed ongoing diplomatic efforts.\n\nIn Beirut, the deputy head of Hezbollah, Sheikh Naim Qassem, told the Associated Press that \"the only confirmed way to achieve a ceasefire on the Lebanese border is through a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza.\"\n\nHe described Hezbollah's participation in supporting Gaza as a \"front of support for the steadfast Palestinian people and their valiant resistance.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the war stops, this military support will no longer exist,\" and continued: \"If Israel reduces its military operations without a formal ceasefire agreement and complete withdrawal from Gaza, the implications of the border conflict between Lebanon and Israel will be less clear.\n\n\"If what will happen in Gaza is a combination between a ceasefire and no ceasefire, war and no war, then we cannot answer what our reaction will be now, because we do not know its form, results and effects.\"\n\nQassem warned that if Israel intended to launch a limited operation in Lebanon that did not amount to a comprehensive war, it should not expect the fighting to remain limited.\n\n\"It should expect that our response and resistance will not be within the ceiling and rules of engagement determined by Israel,\" he said.\n\nTehran heightened its support for Hezbollah in the face of a potential Israeli attack.\n\nKamal Kharazi, the foreign affairs adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, told the Financial Times that \"in the event of a broad Israeli offensive against Hezbollah, there is a risk of sparking a regional conflict where Tehran and the resistance axis will back Hezbollah fully.\"\n\nHowever, he emphasized that \"Iran does not seek a regional war and that expanding the conflict is not beneficial to anyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org",

Scores of rockets were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel on Wednesday morning, hours after Israeli airstrikes killed four officials from the militant Hezbollah group including [...]\n\nCHEBAA, Lebanon (AP) -- With cease-fire talks faltering in Gaza and no clear offramp for the conflict on the Lebanon-Israel border, the daily exchanges of strikes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces have sparked fires that are tearing through forests and farmland on both sides of the frontline.\n\nThe blazes -- exacerbated by supply shortages and security concerns -- have consumed thousands of hectares of land in southern Lebanon and northern Israel, becoming one of the most visible signs of the escalating conflict.\n\nThere is an increasingly real possibility of a full-scale war -- one that would have catastrophic consequences for people on both sides of the border. Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nBurn scars in Israel\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nNumbers and weapons\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors":

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nBurn scars in Israel\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nNumbers and weapons\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.\n\nLidman reported from northern Israel.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType":

A clear indication, if any more is needed, of the regional consequences total war will bring.\n\nHezollah's defiant posture may stem from fears that Hamas has been weakened in Gaza, leading to the possibility that Israel will target Hezbollah and Lebanon next. But whilst Hamas may have been weakened, it is far from defeat. The group remains the de facto Gaza authority and has been regrouping, recruiting and changing tactics. Israeli army casualties continue to be reported in areas of northern Gaza that had been declared \"cleansed\" weeks earlier.\n\nAccording to Hezbollah, the Israeli army is trapped in a war of attrition it cannot win. Israel's military advantage has not yielded any of Netanyahu's declared goals. This strategic failure has eaten into the Israeli army's capabilities, morale and, most importantly, undermined its deterrence.\n\nSince 1948, Israel has built much of its deterrence policy on \"escalation dominance\", which relies on the deployment of excessive force of retaliation. This has allowed Israel to take the battle to the enemy's territory and insulate most Israelis from harm, while inflicting -- purposely -- atrocities on the target's civilians and civilian infrastructure.\n\nThis may have worked against conventional armies where the odds were relatively calculable. But in asymmetrical warfare with non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel's deterrence has been reduced to a tactical endeavour and has lost much of its strategic meaning. In order words, it's become about destruction and killing, and nothing else.\n\nSince October, Israeli officials have threatened to repeatedly \"turn Beirut into another Gaza\".\n\nHowever, even before then 'warnings' of total destruction were commonplace in Israeli politics. Army chief Aviv Kohavi warned in early 2023 that if a war broke out with Hezbollah, \"Israel would send Lebanon 50 years back in time\" through what he called \"waves of firepower.\" Likewise, then-Netanyahu's minister of education, Naftali Bennett, warned in 2017 that Israel \"would send Lebanon back to the Middle Ages.\"\n\nThese aren't just empty words, Israel's genocidal intent in Lebanon is real and has history. Israel's 34-day attack on Lebanon in 2006 -- and it's murderous strategy to target civilians dubbed the Dahiya Doctrine -- killed more than 1200 Lebanese, displacing thousands, and causing more than $3.6bn worth of damage to key civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe Dahiya Doctrine has since been pushed to its utmost limit in Gaza with, needless to say, horrifying effect. The Lebanese population can only imagine what a second round of indiscriminate Israeli bombing will do, especially as Israel is acting as an injured animal: extremely violent but aimless.\n\nHowever, overwhelming Israeli firepower and mass destruction, no matter how horrifying, does not guarantee success or achieve strategic victory.\n\nHezbollah's ability to maintain escalation and strike back is not bound by a functioning state behind it -- assuming the Lebanese state is somewhat crippled by an Israeli attack -- and thus has a larger scope of manoeuvrability and mobility than a regular army.\n\nIt has effectively used a huge range of precision weapons -- some of which remain undeclared -- that has wreaked havoc on the Israeli army. Not to mention that Hezbollah is the first armed group -- and army, state or otherwise -- that has imposed a buffer zone inside Israel since Israel's inception. The party is also entrenched in Lebanese society and is an intrinsic part of its political make-up, so it may be impossible to destroy or dismantle.\n\n\"Overwhelming Israeli firepower and mass destruction, no matter how horrifying, does not guarantee success or achieve strategic victory\"\n\nBut Nasrallah's confidence does not only stem from Israel's failure to maintain escalation dominance and Hezbollah's military efficacy but also from Israel's unprecedented internal and international predicaments.\n\nThe Israeli-Jewish society is now split into two non-reconciliatory camps: religious Zionism led by Netanyahu and his far-right coalition, and secular Zionism led by the opposition. The differences are spilling over on the streets with daily anti-Netanyahu protests and counter-protests by the settler movement -- aka the \"state of Judea\" -- led by Ben Gvir and Smotrich. The High Court ruling that the Haredim can no longer be exempt from the army service is infusing more cracks into the collective tribe mentality and could lead to civil war.\n\nAn additional factor is that, since October 7, the gap between the government and the army widened and public faith in the Israeli army has plummeted. Hamas and Hezbollah showed Israelis the limitations of their military might, and the Iranian attack on Israel last April confirmed that Israel could not defend itself without US and regional assistance.\n\nThis is all compounded by the failure of Israeli hasbara, Israel becoming an international pariah, and its prime minister and defence minister being wanted for war crimes by the ICC.\n\nThese three factors play into Hezbollah's hand and gives them confidence that they can inflict huge costs on Israel. No longer can Israel blitzkrieg its way through the region nor will Israelis be insulated from their country's war crimes.\n\nIn the past nine months, Hezbollah has lost more than 300 of his fighters in the skirmishes with Israel but continues to tie any clamour in the north with ending Israel's aggression in Gaza. Any wide-scale confrontation will be the last resort and only in self-defence.\n\nIsrael understands that an attack on Lebanon will not be a picnic but are yet to accept the Gaza-Lebanon linkage. Some Israeli leaders, among whom Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, allegedly lean toward calm with Hezbollah without ending the mass atrocities in Gaza. Others in the army may also be hoping that by moving to the \"Third Phase\" in the Gaza offensive and limiting the war to targeted attacks only, will calm the Northern Front.\n\nNeither option is rational, let alone practical. It bypasses the casus belli and ignores Bibi Netanyahu and his lackeys' dangerous personal ambitions. All of which make the a regional explosion a serious possibility. And, if this to happen, Israel will not come out standing on both legs.\n\nDr Emad Moussa is a Palestinian-British researcher and writer specialising in the political psychology of intergroup and conflict dynamics, focusing on MENA with a special interest in Israel/Palestine.

media.\n\nThe Iran-backed group said that \"commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser\", also known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\" had been killed, and also announced the death of a second fighter.\n\nThe Israeli army said in a statement that it \"eliminated\" Nasser, saying he was \"the commander of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation's Aziz Unit which is responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon at Israeli territory\".\n\nIn a statement, Hezbollah said that \"as part of the response to the attack and assassination that the enemy carried out\" in south Lebanon's Tyre, its fighters attacked two positions in the Israeli-annexed Syrian Golan Heights \"with 100 Katyusha rockets\".\n\nThe militant group also claimed another retaliatory attack with \"Falaq rockets\" on a base in northern Israel.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson told AFP that about 100 rocket launches had been made towards Israel from Lebanon.\n\n- 'Prevent a conflagration' -\n\nThe source close to Hezbollah said Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, a commander killed in an Israeli strike last month who was described by a Lebanese military source at the time as the \"most important\" Hezbollah commander killed to date.\n\nThat strike prompted Hezbollah to intensify its attacks on Israeli targets, firing barrages of rockets across the border in the days that followed.\n\nThe Israeli army statement Wednesday said that Nasser and Abdallah \"served as two of the most significant Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon\".\n\nA second source close to Hezbollah, also requesting anonymity, said Nasser was the third senior Hezbollah commander to be killed in almost nine months of hostilities.\n\nIn January, a security source said an Israeli strike killed Wissam Hassan Tawil, another top commander from the group.\n\nNasser's death followed a relative easing of cross-border exchanges over the past week, after threats on both sides had intensified.\n\nHezbollah announced a series of other attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Wednesday, while Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported Israeli attacks in other parts of south Lebanon.\n\nFears the violence, so far largely restricted to the border area, could turn into all-out war have sparked a flurry of diplomatic efforts to lower tensions.\n\nOn Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a \"conflagration\" between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made repeated visits to Lebanon in recent months, was due in Paris on Wednesday where he was due to meet with Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 495 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

According to Sam Rose, the director of planning at the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), about 250,000 people fled to a new \"off-limits area\", and another 50,000 may also flee in the near future due to their proximity to the fighting.News of the Palestinians' relocation is disheartening as many of the more than 1 million Palestinian civilians who fled the Israeli assault on Rafah had been sheltering in Khan Yunis and are once more being forcibly displaced, Sputnik's Rachel Blevins noted.Ecuadorian journalist and editor of The Cradle, Esteban Carrillo, joined The Backstory on Tuesday to discuss the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel's reported threats against Hezbollah. Carrillo suggested that there is no such thing as a \"safe zone\" in the Gaza Strip and that there hasn't been for the \"past nine months\".\"Gaza, it's such a small place. It's about 360 km square. It's like a small US city, and nine months in it's being flattened, it's being destroyed. No services, no running water, no electricity, no heating during the winter. No cool air during the summer. And what are they doing? You know, what are they doing besides just killing loads of civilians? What is the Israeli army doing there? They are depleting their ammunition supplies. They are essentially running on fumes at this point,\" he added.\"What is the Israeli army doing in Gaza nine months into this genocide? How much longer is it going to take them to achieve their stated goal, right, which was to completely destroy Hamas. How many times are they going to announce that they disabled Hamas battalions, that they crippled Hamas, that they would destroy all Hamas fighters in specific cities only for two or three months down the line to have to go back in.\"Israel seems set to scale down their bombardment of Gaza, and turn their attention to the north with a possible war against Hezbollah on the horizon, Blevins reported. However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week that there have been no signs that Israel will lower their bombardment of the Gaza Strip.\"How can they slow down when the Pentagon sends weapons on an average of every four days? Bombs and shells and ammunition, and they are hitting Gaza with such ferocity that there's concerns that they are running out of shells, despite the fact that they keep getting replenished,\" Carrillo explained. \"So, the only plan here was, yes, to kill as many Palestinians as possible to make this trip uninhabitable.\"\"And I think Israeli leaders are kind of hoping that this is going to be the case for them, too, so that they continue on with their genocide and their ethnic cleansing campaign and without having to deal with so much pressure from the global stage,\" he added. \"And what makes it, what would make the Israelis stop and not come at us next or somebody else, that is, a proxy of a larger power, like the US.\"On June 18, the IDF reportedly approved and validated operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Israel was \"very close\" to a decision to \"change the rules\" against Hezbollah and Lebanon and threatened to destroy the movement \"in an all-out war\" and \"severely hit\" Lebanon, Sputnik reported on Saturday. During the interview, Blevins suggested that Israel may want to escalate tensions with Lebanon as a way to distract the world stage from the humanitarian crises in Gaza.\"[Israel doesn't] know where Hezbollah is. Hezbollah also has a network of tunnels in the border. So it's the same situation that they would find themselves in Gaza. The only thing they could go for is for Lebanese infrastructure, and that would just unleash the wrath of not just Hezbollah, the Iraqi resistance that was already pledged to join this fight. The Yemenis would expand their operations. Even there, in Afghanistan, the Taliban has offered to send soldiers to fight Israel. And you have Iran who are saying if Israel expands the war on Lebanon, Hezbollah has our full support.\"\"You know, this genocidal state. So, of course, they're not gonna move. The Lebanese army is not, it's not, it cannot really defend Lebanon to the extent that Lebanon needs defending, right. Remember, Lebanon is a highly, highly, crisis-hit country,\" he added.\"Lebanon is a member of the Arab League. Lebanon is a country that has ties with the US, with the EU, there's a US embassy here, a UK embassy, a French embassy,\" he added. \"We're talking about a sovereign nation that has a resistance force that works as the only bulwark to protect its people and its interest against a state that seeks its destruction, right? So it's not really, it's very unlikely to happen.\"Shortly before the publication of this article, it was reported that an Israeli strike killed one of Hezbollah's top commanders in south Lebanon on Wednesday. The IDF said they killed Hezbollah's Mohammed Nasser, and claimed he was the commander of a unit responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon into Israel, Reuters reported.", "source": {"uri":

Damage from Hezbollah drones and white phosphorus, along with firefighting challenges, has displaced thousands. George Mitri highlights unprecedented fire damage. Affected areas include Moussa Saab's orchard and Kibbutz Sde Nehemia, raising fears of full-scale war.With cease-fire talks faltering in Gaza and no clear offramp for the conflict on the Lebanon-Israel border, the daily exchanges of strikes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces have sparked fires that are tearing through forests and farmland on both sides of the frontline.\n\nThe blazes - exacerbated by supply shortages and security concerns - have consumed thousands of hectares of land in southern Lebanon and northern Israel, becoming one of the most visible signs of the escalating conflict.\n\nThere is an increasingly real possibility of a full-scale war - one that would have catastrophic consequences for people on both sides of the border. Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon In Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April - earlier than the usual fire season - and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men - some using their shirts to beat out flames - stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area - captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nBurn scars in Israel The slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars - the largest a few hundred square meters - remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nNumbers and weapons Since the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people - mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants - have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response Security concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month - nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic

Many of these attacks have targeted Kiryat Shmona (132 attacks), Margaliyot (91 attacks) and Metula (72 attacks).\n\nOther targets include military bases, barracks and airfields. According to Tel Aviv, these attacks have resulted in the deaths of at least 21 Israelis.\n\nHezbollah reported that its military actions have displaced over 200,000 Israelis, forcing the evacuation of over 40 settlements and striking up to 35 kilometers into the occupied territories.\n\nIn recent weeks, Israel has escalated threats to expand the war against Lebanon to regain control of its northern settlements, causing significant concern among international observers and humanitarian organizations.\n\nThe conflict has strained Israel's relationship with its U.S. backers, who are advocating for a diplomatic resolution.\n\n\"We're urgently seeking a diplomatic agreement that restores lasting calm to Israel's northern border and enables civilians to return safely to their homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated on June 25 following a meeting with his Israeli counterpart in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. has also been working with other international actors to broker a ceasefire and provide humanitarian aid to affected areas in both countries.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, Israel said it was prepared for an \"all-out war\" in Lebanon with approved plans to target Hezbollah, officials announced following the release of threatening drone footage by Hezbollah.\n\nThe footage showed civilian and military areas of Haifa, prompting a strong response from Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who warned that Hezbollah would be destroyed and Lebanon severely hit in a war.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed that plans for a ground assault across the northern border have been approved by Ori Gordin, head of the Northern Command. This comes amid ongoing border skirmishes since the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war on Gaza, which has killed at least 37,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in over 400 deaths and 90,000 displacements in Lebanon, with 25 deaths and 60,000 displacements in Israel. The U.S. is working to prevent further escalation, with White House envoy Amos Hochstein emphasizing President Joe Biden's aim to avoid a greater war.\n\nHead over to WWIII.news for similar

The IDF subsequently released a statement saying Hezbollah fired 160 rockets at northern Israel, and launched 15 drones; the majority of which were shot down.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

In the Golan, which stretches from the banks of the Sea of Galilee to the border area between Lebanon and Syria, there were also several incoming drone and rocket alert sirens. There were reports in Katzrin, a town with a population of some 7,500 people that lies about 50 kilometers south of Israel's highest point - Mt. Hermon - and only approximately 12 miles from Lebanon's southernmost settlement, of power outages.\n\nIn response, Israel Air Force jets hit multiple targets in southern Lebanon. A post in Hebrew on the official IDF X account said, \"Following the activation of alerts in the north of the country regarding the infiltration of hostile aircraft and the firing of missiles and rockets, suspicious aerial targets and launches that crossed from Lebanon were identified. The air defense fighters and fighter jets... successfully intercepted several targets and launchers.\" Indeed, Lebanon's National News Agency reported Israeli jets broke the sound barrier in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon.\n\nThe barrages sparked numerous fires across northern Israel, which has experienced temperatures well above 90 degrees Fahrenheit for several weeks, turning grassland into tinder. Indeed, while the Israeli government officially evacuated tens of thousands of people from border towns in the north to places farther south, some agricultural workers still remain, including those who work in the many vineyards dotted around that part of the country. It is estimated that some 4,100 acres of forested land have been burned since Hezbollah started launching rockets on October 8, 2023. Israel is perhaps the only country on the planet that ended the twentieth century with more trees than it had started with 100 years previously.\n\nTensions remain very high in the region, in spite of some evidence of marginal progress regarding a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. According to reports in both the Israeli and wider media, a halt to the fighting in the coastal enclave would provide Hezbollah with an off-ramp to de-escalate the situation on Israel's northern border. Indeed, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden today about the Gaza situation. This will be followed in the evening with Netanyahu holding a cabinet meeting to come up with a reply to Hamas' latest response to a proposal for a hostage deal and possible pause to the war.\n\nThe IDF top brass has intimated that the war against Hamas should be drawn down. They have argued about a lack of remaining significant targets, as well as already having carried out a largely successful campaign of greatly reducing Hamas' fighting capabilities. They also seem to understand the need to potentially focus on the much bigger issue of the threat Hezbollah faces across the northern border. However, it appears the military rationale for ceasing the fighting and the requirements of political expediency are misaligned.\n\nAt a memorial event for Hezbollah's slain commander, another senior leader warned Israel that the terrorist group would aim its missiles at new and unexpected sites. Hashem Safieddine said, \"The series of responses continues in succession, and this series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit,\" according to the Times of Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli-Arab influencer Yoseph Haddad took to his social media channels and warned his hundreds of thousands of followers, \"We've lost the north. Hezbollah is firing missiles and launching drones with impunity; it doesn't matter which leader we've eliminated, if we allow this to continue without declaring war. What are we waiting for? That they will repeat the slaughter of October 7?! If there are rockets falling on Akko, it is time that missiles will fall on Hezbollah areas - including Beirut.\"\n\n\"The people of the north have for nine months been evicted from their homes; and Hezbollah struts around as if they own the place. It's a security weakness that is impossible to live with. If we don't have leaders who are prepared to release the IDF from its shackles and act in a way that the people would support to relieve the north, then make way for leadership that does have the balls to do the necessary work.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

The Lebanese Islamist group has long declared it seeks to destroy Israel.\n\n\"We are in danger of a hellish, existential war,\" Sadek said on June 24 regarding the threats Hezbollah has made to countries such as Cyprus, which is in the European Union. \"We are being held hostage. We have been hijacked by a group that has no clue of what is going on in this planet.\"\n\nShe pointed out that \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin, who was the only one who managed to save your axis in the Syrian war, cannot overcome Europe, so how come you are threatening Europe with such confidence?\"\n\nRegarding the fear and helplessness she and some other Lebanese feel over the direction Hezbollah is taking, she asked, \"Do you know who we resemble? The passengers on the 9/11 airplanes. We are like airplane passengers who do not see what is happening around them. We are being led by one person, and we have no idea where we are heading.\"\n\nShe added, \"The only thing that we know for sure is that this person is taking us to a catastrophe and certain death.\"\n\nHezbollah terrorists have been firing drones, rockets, and missiles at northern Israel daily from southern Lebanon since Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre, leading Israeli forces to strike back. Tensions have been escalating between both sides, fueling concerns that the conflict in Gaza -- the Palestinian enclave ruled by Hamas to Israel's south -- could escalate into a regional conflict.\n\nMore than 80,000 Israelis have evacuated Israel's north and been unable to return to their homes. The majority of those spent the past nine months residing in hotels in safer areas of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah has also stepped up its threats against the rest of the world, including Cyprus.\n\nLast month, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah made a speech in which he said an \"all-out war\" with Israel was \"getting very close.\" He added that if Cyprus, a European Union member, were to help Israel in some way during that war, then \"Cyprus will be part of this war too.\"\n\nIsraeli officials have said that, while they seek a diplomatic resolution to the current situation along the border with Lebanon, they are prepared to escalate military action against Hezbollah to push the terrorist group back in order to allow displaced Israelis to return to their homes.",

The IDF claims most of the projectiles were intercepted but that \"fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel\".", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/1720104662_c8a44185-0f1c-4751-b1a1-0b660f36d410-3x2.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 130, "textEnd": 136}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nBurn scars in Israel\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nNumbers and weapons\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

As Americans wake up, Israelis are experiencing a modern \"rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air.\"\n\nUnfortunately, despite the U.S. embassy hosting a festive event yesterday, these are not celebratory fireworks but the consequence of war from the Iranian Islamic regime proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon.\n\nSubscribe to have The Washington Times' Higher Ground delivered to your inbox every Sunday.\n\nAs of this writing, Israel has endured more than an hour of near-nonstop incoming barrages of rockets and exploding drones across the northern border, from the Haifa Bay area, Acco and Nahariya on the western coast, across the Galilee and Golan to the east, and south along the Sea of Galilee. As harrowing and angering as this is, what's worse is knowing that at any moment Hezbollah could unleash an even more massive barrage, including thousands of precision GPS-guided missiles, not just in the north but at all of Israel.\n\nHaving just returned home to Israel yesterday from a weeks-long speaking and book tour across a dozen states, I was up early managing the inevitable jetlag. Sipping coffee over the morning news, in addition to the weather forecast, an exceedingly hot day, Israelis received a war forecast as well. In 20 years, I don't ever remember hearing reports like this. The report went something like this, \"dangerous heat levels with a high probability of incoming rockets.\"\n\nWhy of all days such a report today?\n\nYesterday, the IDF targeted Muhammad Nimah Nasser, one of Hezbollah's senior commanders, in a pinpoint UAV strike on the vehicle in which he was traveling. Using the seasonal July 4 metaphor, some have said he was turned into bar-b-que. He was the third such high-level targeted attack against a senior Hezbollah leader, the precision of which demonstrated Israel's intelligence and ability to track and target the highest-level terrorist leaders while avoiding harming non-combatants.\n\nBy comparison, the Iranian-backed terror group responded by firing hundreds of rockets and drones predominantly targeting civilian areas. While it was all happening, one friend reported that he had been at home without power for half an hour already, and another that the sky in northern Israel was \"thick with the roar of IDF aircraft, and it looks like it's not ending anytime soon.\"\n\nThroughout my speaking tour, one of the questions that came up repeatedly was when the war with Hezbollah would begin.\n\nFirst, I noted that the war already has begun. For months already Hezbollah has been firing dozens of rockets and drones, leaving as many as 100,000 Israelis internally displaced because it's not safe to be in their communities. Israel has successfully targeted (what's reported) more than 300 Hezbollah terrorist leaders, also demonstrating the ability to target the terrorists while limiting harm to civilians among whom the Lebanese terrorists have entrenched their weapons and terrorist infrastructure, just as Hamas has done throughout Gaza.\n\nWhat has not happened yet is an all-out Israeli airstrike against Hezbollah throughout Lebanon, or the expected response by the Islamic terrorists, to fire thousands of missiles, rockets, and drones at all of Israel.\n\nI noted that throughout my trip, I woke up uneasily each day, wondering if news of that all-out war would have become a reality, and I'd need to cancel the rest of my itinerary to fly home. I joked I might have to do a crowdfunding campaign just to get a ticket as most airlines would cancel and even El Al would be pressed to maintain capacity. It's an odd thing, but true, that even amid war, there's no place like home, with my family and nation. Even Dorothy knew she was returning to tornadoes.\n\nExpecting the inevitability and unfortunate necessity of such a war, many Israelis have stocked up on things like water, batteries, non-perishable food, indoor activities for kids, non-electric landline phones, and even individual solar panels to provide some electricity during what's anticipated to be a widespread loss of power.\n\nA dozen or so countries have called upon their citizens to leave Lebanon for their safety. International airlines have reduced, altered, or canceled flights into Beirut.\n\nOn my way to Newark airport, I read that Lebanon's Foreign Minister passed a message to Israel through Azerbaijan that they don't want war. I chuckled in disbelief. If the Lebanese didn't want a war, they should have prevented Hezbollah from hijacking their country and arming it to the teeth in violation of UN resolutions, and common sense. When there is an all-out war, it is Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Lebanese people who are to blame.\n\nFortunately, most Americans realize this too.\n\nA recent Harvard Harris poll conducted between June 28-30 indicated that 67% of Americans support an Israeli response against Hezbollah if Hezbollah continues to launch rockets at Israel. A similar percentage (62) recognize that Israel is making an effort to prevent harm to civilians in Gaza. Additionally, 80% support Israel over Hamas (leading one to wonder about the morality of the 20%), and 82% believe Hamas must be removed from Gaza.\n\nNot all Israelis are dual U.S. citizens like me and my family, but most of us widely support the U.S. and look at it as a critical ally, based on a common foundation of democracy and Judeo-Christian values. We celebrate America every day. As Americans celebrate America today, I pray that for a moment they will realize the \"rockets' red glare and bombs bursting in air\" is not just a lovely rhyme that Francis Scott Key wrote following a major battle of the War of 1812, but something that we live with here in Israel, daily, as a battle that the U.S. and Israel must engage and win in the wider war against Islamic terror and threats to our liberty.\n\n-\n\nJonathan Feldstein was born and educated in the U.S. and immigrated to Israel in 2004.

Photo cortesy of Ayal Margolin/Flash90.\n\nJNS\n\nIsrael has \"effectively lost sovereignty\" over the northern part of its country amid ongoing attacks from Lebanon, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, July 1. \"People don't feel safe to go to their homes,\" the secretary stated during a panel at the Brookings Institute, noting that \"you have many Lebanese in southern Lebanon who have also been chased from their homes.\"\n\nDisplacement Of Peoples\n\n\"Absent doing something about the insecurity, people won't have the confidence to go back,\" Blinken said of the conflict with Hezbollah.\n\nWashington's efforts are focused on getting \"people back to their homes in Israel, in southern Lebanon, and have something that's more enduring in terms of keeping things calm,\" according to the diplomat.\n\nDamages In Israel\n\nHezbollah has attacked Israel's north nearly every day since joining the war in support of Hamas on Oct. 8, firing thousands of suicide drones, rockets and anti-tank missiles at Israeli border towns, killing more than 20 people and causing widespread damage. Tens of thousands of Israeli civilians remain internally displaced due to the ongoing violence.\n\nAccording to data made public on Tuesday, July 2,more than 1,000 buildings in more than 130 towns have been damaged in the Hezbollah attacks. An initial investigation by authorities showed that Kibbutz Manara, near Kiryat Shmona in the Upper Galilee, has suffered the most severe damage. The head of the Upper Galilee Regional Council, Giora Zaltz, told Ynet that in many communities, \"it is not possible to assess the damages to the infrastructure, buildings and houses\" due to the security threat.\n\nDiplomacy?\n\nIn the Brookings Institute interview, Blinken said any political deal for the north \"requires first and foremost, of course, stopping the [Hezbollah] firing across the border that's endangering people.\" However, he added, \"it also requires an agreement reached through diplomacy to try to deal with some of the elements that are causing this ongoing insecurity, including making sure that [terrorist] forces, for example, are pulled back so that they can't endanger people every single day and that people have the confidence to proceed.\"\n\nBlinken noted that while for Hezbollah to attack Israel in support of Hamas is \"wrong in and of itself,\" realpolitik requires a ceasefire with the Gaza-based terrorist organization, which he said could \"be critical to further enabling the diplomacy to try to create conditions in which the diplomacy can really resolve this problem\" on the northern border.\n\nIsrael Considers Campaign\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to continue the attacks until a \"complete and permanent ceasefire\" is reached in Gaza. Last month, the IDF formally \"authorized and validated\" operational plans for a campaign aimed at pushing Hezbollah north of the Litani River, which was also the stated goal of 2006's UNSC Resolution 1701.\n\nIsrael might launch the operation as early as this month, Germany's Bild has reported, citing unnamed diplomatic sources. The report came against the background of Lufthansa suspending night flights to Beirut.\n\nThe deputy director of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, Ole Diehl, recently met with Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Lebanese media recently reported. Diehl was said to have warned that a mistake by either party could result in all-out war. Qassem \"refused to discuss anything before [Israel] stops the war on Gaza\" and urged Berlin to put pressure on Jerusalem, according to the report.\n\nDuring meetings in Washington Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stressed that while Jerusalem prefers a diplomatic solution, it will take whatever action is required to restore security to the north. \"We do not want war, but we are preparing for every scenario,\" Gallant stated following the meetings. Jerusalem has emphasized that any deal \"will not be an agreement on paper\" but must include \"the physical removal of Hezbollah from the border, and we will have to enforce it.\"\n\nAn Iranian general recently told relatives of Hamas terrorists killed in Gaza that the Islamic Republic was prepared to launch another attack on Israel, similar to its unprecedented missile and drone.\n\n\"We await an opportunity for 'True Promise II' ... in which I do not know how many missiles will be fired,\" said Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps aerospace forces commander Brig.-Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh. Hajizadeh's remarks came only days after the Islamic Republic threatened Israel with a \"war of obliteration\" if the country launched a broad military action against Hezbollah in Lebanon.", "source":

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Francisco Gate"},

Despite the rapidly escalating rhetoric, and the clashes along the Israel-Lebanon border, the U.S. Secretary of State insisted: \"I don't think any of the potential belligerents actually want to see a war or conflict spread. I don't believe Israel does. I don't believe Hezbollah does. Lebanon certainly doesn't because it would suffer the most. I don't believe that Iran does. And yet you have momentum potentially in that direction.\"\n\nThis week, the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, said a decision on an all-out war with Hezbollah was coming soon, and generals said their plans for an offensive into Lebanon were signed off. Hezbollah published drone footage of Israeli sites including key infrastructure in Haifa, and its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, warned of a war \"without rules or ceilings.\"\n\nThe past eight months have shown that the parties are calibrating their deeds even as they ratchet up their words. And yet the prospect of a large-scale war has grown.\n\nBlinken identified the risk as miscalculation. The deeper danger may be the momentum generated by the clashes, which have slowly but steadily escalated, with each side coming to see a greater conflict as inescapable. For many residents in northern Israel, the horrors of the Hamas raid on Oct. 7 made continuing to live with Hezbollah on the doorstep unthinkable. Since then, Hezbollah has shown it can threaten Israel over an extended period at relatively low cost. On Hezbollah's side, holding back may give Israel more time to prepare an assault.\n\nTens of thousands of people have already fled their homes in Lebanon and Israel; dozens have been killed, in addition to hundreds of Hezbollah fighters and more than a dozen Israeli soldiers. Israel has reportedly told the U.S. that it plans a lightning attack.\n\nSign Up for Newsletters Email* Select Newsletters to Sign Up For News Updates Breaking News Sports Digest Obituaries and Death Notices Submit\n\nIts confidence that it can get out as easily as it gets in is startling given its own record in Lebanon. It has failed to achieve Benjamin Netanyahu's declared goals in Gaza -- the elimination of Hamas and the return of hostages -- eight months and a reported 37,000-plus Palestinian deaths after it took on a far less experienced and less well-armed foe. It would face war on two fronts (not counting Houthi attacks in the Red Sea), with Israel Defense Forces troops who have spent months fighting in Gaza.\n\nThe rift between the Israeli prime minister and the army is increasingly public: this week, the IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said bluntly that \"Hamas is an idea\" and cannot be destroyed, adding: \"The political echelon needs to find an alternative -- or it will remain.\"\n\nAn end to the war in Gaza may offer an off\u2011ramp in the north. But it cannot be depended upon. Each party has a reason to avoid further escalation. Hezbollah's status is enhanced by the current situation and Iran does not want to squander a deterrent against an attack on its nuclear facilities.\n\nLebanon is on its knees already. A full-scale conflict would be an existential risk to Israel itself in a way that the invasion of Gaza was not, with the U.S. warning that its missile defenses in the north could be overwhelmed -- reportedly echoing domestic concerns.\n\nNetanyahu doesn't listen to the Biden administration. He has smashed through its red lines and went out of his way to pick a fight with it this week.

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nBurn scars in Israel\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nNumbers and weapons\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

As with all terrorists, the prospect of greater conflict and chaos is being used to achieve political ends.\" -- Behnam Ben Taleblu, FDD Senior Fellow\n\n\"Iran is seeking to deter Israel from attacking Hezbollah by threatening Israel with a wider war in the region and boasting about Hezbollah's capabilities. For Iran, Hezbollah is its foremost proxy in the region, in which it has invested heavily throughout the last decades. Iran views Hezbollah as such a valuable asset that it wants to prevent Hezbollah from suffering a setback in any escalation after Hezbollah carried out more than 5,000 attacks on Israel.\" -- Seth J.

The Iran-aligned group later said it had launched 100 katyusha rockets targeting Israeli military positions.\n\nThe announcement of Nasser's death on the group's Telegram did not provide the location, but a source previously told Al Jazeera that a commander had been killed in the Hosh area in Tyre in southern Lebanon. A source close to the group confirmed to the AFP news agency that Nasser had been killed in the Tyre attack.\n\nThe source said that Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, another top commander who was killed by an Israeli attack in June. At the time, Abdallah was the highest-ranking Hezbollah military official killed since the group began fighting Israel on October 8 in response to bombardment of Gaza. Following Abdallah's killing, Hezbollah launched one of its largest rocket barrages on northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed it targeted Nasse ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tyre, Lebanon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-08", "textStart": 1167, "textEnd": 1176}], "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nBurn scars in Israel\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over last year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority. Looking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon\n\nIn Israel, the images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Shebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and a UN peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Shebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nNumbers and weapons\n\nSince the war began, the Israel Defense Forces has tracked 5,450 launches from Lebanon toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nThe border clashes began October 8, a day after the Hamas-led terror onslaught in southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, sparking the war in Gaza.\n\nSince October 8, Hezbollah-led forces have attacked Israeli communities and military posts along the border on a near-daily basis, with the group saying it is doing so to support Gaza amid the war there.\n\nSo far, the skirmishes on the border have resulted in 10 civilian deaths on the Israeli side, as well as the deaths of 15 IDF soldiers and reservists. Hezbollah has named 360 members who have been killed by Israel during the ongoing skirmishes, mostly in Lebanon but some also in Syria. In Lebanon, another 65 operatives from other terror groups, a Lebanese soldier, and more than 90 civilians have been reported killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to the Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue Services, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of Lebanon's Shebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as in a normal year.\n\nOn the other side of the border, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue Services, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swaths have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border in order to restore security there. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nOn Thursday, Israel's Fire and Rescue Service said it was tackling fires in 10 separate areas sparked by barrages of missiles fired by Hezbollah in retaliation for an Israeli strike that killed one of its top commanders the day before.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict: \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType":

Some rights groups estimate the death toll to be much higher when accounting for those presumed dead.\n\n** The death toll in the West Bank and Jerusalem is not updated regularly. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health on July 3, this is the latest figure.\n\n*** These figures are released by the Israeli military, showing the soldiers whose names \"were allowed to be published.\" The number of Israeli soldiers wounded according to declarations by the head of the Israeli army's wounded association to Israel's Channel 12 exceeds 20,000 including at least 8,000 permanently handicapped as of June 1. Israel's Channel 7 reported that according to the Israeli war ministry's rehabilitation service numbers, 8,663 new wounded joined the army's handicap rehabilitation system since October 7, as of June 18.\n\nThe Israeli Mossad and the office of Israel's Prime Minister announced on Wednesday that mediators in the ceasefire talks gave Israel Hamas's response to the U.S.-amended ceasefire proposal. Benjamin Netanyahu is set to head a cabinet meeting later on Thursday to discuss Hamas's response. Meanwhile, Israel's Channel 12 quoted a high-ranking Israeli official saying that Hamas's response \"for the first time allows for making progress in negotiations.\"\n\nFor its part, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot reported that the heads of Israel's security forces were \"angry at the attempts of Netanyahu and Smotrich to sabotage the deal,\" pointing accusations at Netanyahu of obstructing communication channels with mediators beforehand.\n\nThe families of Israeli captives in Gaza warned that they would increase their protests to include \"millions in the streets\" if Netanyahu doesn't accept the deal this time. Protests demanding a captive exchange deal and new elections in Israel have been escalating in recent weeks, and on Wednesday, protesters demonstrated outside Netanyahu's residence in Cesarea, blocking main highways between Tel Aviv and Haifa.\n\nIn Gaza, the Israeli army continued to bomb residential blocks in Gaza City, Rafah, and Khan Younis. The Gaza branch of the Palestinian health ministry's daily reports indicated the targeting of 12 family homes across the strip since Monday. On Thursday, Al Jazeera reported the aftermath of an Israeli strike on a family apartment between the Sabra and Daraj neighborhoods in Gaza City. Residents at the site told Al Jazeera that seven people were killed, including at least three children. One of the neighbors said that the children fell to their deaths from the third-floor apartment and that one was found without a head.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli strikes targeted the surroundings of the Naser Hospital in Khan Younis, where hundreds of families take shelter from Israeli bombings. One Palestinian was initially reported dead, and several wounded. The hospital announced on Thursday that several of its sections went out of service due to the lack of fuel for generators, as a result of Israel's closure of the Rafah border crossing.\n\nLast April, Nasser Hospital was the site of the uncovering of several mass graves that contained the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians, many of them with bound hands and medical catheters still attached to their bodies.\n\nOn Thursday, sirens echoed on Thursday across the upper Galilee area as hundreds of rockets from Lebanon struck the region. Meanwhile, Hezbollah announced that its fighters fired some 250 rockets and 20 drones at Israeli military positions as far as 35 kilometers beyond Lebanon's southern border.\n\nHezbollah's statement added that the attack came in response to Israel's assassination of a high-ranking Hezbollah commander on Wednesday in an airstrike on the city of Tyre in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe strike targeted Muhammad Naameh Naser, 59, or \"Abu Naameh,\" the commander of Hezbollah's \"Aziz unit.\" Israel claimed that Naser was responsible for all of Hezbollah's operations in southern Lebanon's western front. Naser had been an active operative of the Lebanese resistance since 1982, before the establishment of Hezbollah. According to the group, Naser fought Israeli forces in southern Lebanon in the 1990s, in the 2006 war, and was wounded in the fight against Syrian rebels and ISIL between 2011 and 2013.\n\nAbu Naameh Naser was the second-highest-ranking Hezbollah commander to be killed by Israel in less than a month. In mid-June, Israel killed Abu Taleb Abdallah, the commander of Hezbollah's \"Nasr\" unit. Hezbollah responded with hundreds of rockets at the time, causing widespread fires in the northern Galilee region and raising the possibility of an all-out war with Israel to unprecedented levels.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. envoy Amos Hockstein arrived in Paris on Wednesday to meet with French officials in an attempt to join efforts to defuse tensions along Lebanon's southern border, with the aim of preventing a total war with Israel.\n\nIsraeli forces killed four Palestinians in an airstrike on Tulkarem's Nur Shams refugee camp on Wednesday.\n\nThe four men, aged between 20 and 25, raised the number of Palestinians killed by Israel in Tulkarem alone to eight since last weekend. On Sunday, an Israeli airstrike killed a 23-year-old Palestinian who was a leading member of the local Tulkarem Brigade.\n\nOn Monday, Israeli soldiers raiding Nur Shams camp killed a 45-year-old woman and a 15-year-old teenager. And on Tuesday, Israeli undercover forces entered Nur Shams and opened fire at a car, killing a 20-year-old Palestinian, who Israel accused of belonging to the Tulkarem Brigade.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli government approved the confiscation of some 13 square kilometers in the Jordan Valley on Wednesday, marking the largest single land grab by Israel in the West Bank since 1993.\n\nPeace Now, the Israeli NGO, reported that the Israeli government declared the land as state property, which has been Israel's main method of expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank since 1967. According to Peace Now, the year 2024 has witnessed a peak in Israeli confiscation of Palestinian land, reaching 237 square kilometers since the beginning of the year.\n\nEarlier in June, Israel's finance minister Bezalel Smotrich revealed an ongoing plan to transfer administrative powers over the West Bank from the Israeli army to the government in a speech to settler leaders. According to Smotrich, this move would facilitate the legalization of settlement outposts and increase settlement building, while preventing the West Bank \"from becoming part of a Palestinian state.\"", "source": {"uri": "mondoweiss.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondoweiss"}, "authors": [{"uri": "qassam_muaddi@mondoweiss.net", "name": "Qassam Muaddi", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The group's leader on 19 June said that Cyprus could become a target if it allowed 'Israel to use its territory in any conflict'. In our view, this threat is largely rhetorical and aimed at deterring Israel from initiating a major escalation in southern Lebanon. But with conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border intensifying, further Hezbollah threats against Cyprus and the group flying reconnaissance drones in the Eastern Mediterranean are probable in the coming weeks.\n\nHezbollah's threats against Cyprus seem to be an attempt to deter Israel from expanding its military operations in Lebanon. In our analysis, the group intends to push European countries to exert further pressure on Israel. That is after Israeli media reports this week that its military has approved plans for a military offensive with Hezbollah in the coming weeks. And it follows an intensification of cross-border attacks between the two, involving hours-long daily operations.\n\nHezbollah is threatening Cyprus specifically for several reasons, in our view. First, it is the closest European country that the group is able to target with precision missiles and armed drones. Second, Cyprus hosts a major UK military base (Akrotiri), which has reportedly been used for UK-US military operations against the Houthis in recent months. But there is no publicly available evidence that Israel has used that base or Cypriot airspace in its conflict against Hamas and Hezbollah this year. Third, there is precedent for Hezbollah activity in Cyprus targeting Israeli interests.\n\nWe doubt that Hezbollah will mount a direct military action against Cyprus, and especially not a high impact attack against a port or military sites. That would be a major escalation. And it would potentially compel Europe to take action against the group, or at least step up support for Israel to do so. Additionally, an attack on Cyprus would make Hezbollah unpopular at home. It would disrupt potential evacuation routes from Lebanon - upon which Lebanese nationals would also rely - in the event of a crisis. The Cypriot president said on 20 June that his country remains uninvolved in any military conflicts, and facilitated aid shipments to Gaza throughout the conflict.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a strike by Hezbollah on Cyprus, we anticipate some European nations would feel compelled to carry out at least a localised response, albeit not immediately. While Cyprus does not benefit from NATO Article 5 protection, it is part of the EU defence pact on the basis of which other EU members, such as Greece can provide protection. Turkey and the UK (both NATO members) have troops and bases on the island too and would probably act to defend their people and assets were any of them hit. Beyond anti-Houthi operations, the UK's Akrotiri airbase is a forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East.\n\nStill, further rhetorical threats by the group are likely over the coming weeks. That is given tensions between Israel and Hezbollah are showing no signs of waning. At most, these might be followed by limited Hezbollah action such as it sending reconnaissance drones near Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean more broadly. It has done so on several occasions in recent years around disputed (between Israel and Lebanon) offshore gas fields there. Such actions would provide Hezbollah with an opportunity to be seen to act on its threats, without risking a reaction from Europe.\n\nPro-Iran groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen are also likely to claim attacks against commercial vessels in the Eastern Mediterranean over the coming weeks. They have already claimed several attacks there in the past few weeks after the Houthis on 5 June said it would target ships in these waters. Although it is plausible that they have launched drone and missile attacks towards these waters, there has been little evidence that they have been successful. The Houthis have also previously made similar false claims.\n\nIt is also plausible that, following the recent threat by Hezbollah's leader, sympathisers with the group in Cyprus may feel emboldened or inspired to carry out an attack on the island in the coming months. There have been pro-Iran and Hezbollah operatives in Cyprus before. In December 2023, Israel said it helped the Cypriot authorities to foil an attack against Jews on the island by Iran-backed operatives. Any incident would probably involve a crude shooting or stabbing, or the setting off of a small explosive device, targeting Israelis or an Israeli entity, or individuals or businesses perceived as supporting Israel.\n\nAlbeit unlikely, it is still plausible that Hezbollah would directly attack Cyprus. But such a scenario would become likely only in the latter stages of a major war between Israel and Hezbollah in our assessment. Hezbollah might for example mount direct attacks should it be facing very heavy battlefield losses and appear on the verge of losing a conflict with Israel. In any case, this stage of a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah would carry with it a potential for a wider regional war, involving the US, Iran and pro-Iran groups across the region.\n\nWe have identified some indicators that would suggest Hezbollah attacks against Cyprus are becoming likely:\n\nIn an all-out regional war scenario, the group would plausibly also encourage its members, or supporters on the island to carry out attacks there. These would involve bombings or shootings targeting Israeli diplomatic entities or assets, or other Cypriot or Western political buildings. According to both the local authorities and media outlets, the group has attempted to distribute and stockpile explosives on the island. That is supported on reported discoveries over the past several years. And it has shown the capability to carry out such attacks; in 2012 Hezbollah bombed and killed seven Israeli tourists in Burgas, Bulgaria.", "source": {"uri": "dragonflyintelligence.com", "dataType":

Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke of his nation being engaged in a \"seven-front war\" with Iran, saying it supports an informal coalition of regionwide factions known as the \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\nThe following day, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations shared with Newsweek and published to X, formerly Twitter, a stark warning against any Israeli \"full-scale military aggression\" in Lebanon, home to the powerful Hezbollah movement that has been engaged with Israel in tit-for-tat cross-border attacks.\n\nSuch a move, the Iranian Mission warned, would lead to an \"obliterating war\" and, potentially, \"the involvement of all Resistance Fronts.\"\n\nIn response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Newsweek that \"the IDF is prepared for a variety of security scenarios in all areas, and will continue to protect the State of Israel from the various threats.\"\n\nNow, with threats only escalating and no imminent signs of ceasefire in Gaza or the Israel-Lebanon border, Newsweek has outlined the seven fronts in which Israel has already faced strikes and where further escalations could manifest in the event of a larger-scale conflict breaking out.\n\nThe Gaza Strip\n\nIsrael and Hamas have engaged in several conflicts and flare-ups since the Islamist Palestinian group took control of Gaza in 2007, two years after the IDF disengaged from a territory they occupied for decades and just one year after Hamas emerged victorious in Palestinian elections, sparking a violent rift with the traditionally dominant left-wing Fatah party. The deadly October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas and the ensuing IDF offensive, however, has sparked the longest and deadliest war to date in the densely populated coastal territory.\n\nWhile Israeli officials have claimed major gains in the conflict, they have also acknowledged that achieving their stated goals of defeating Hamas as a functioning military and political entity, ensuring Gaza could not present a threat in the future and returning hostages still held in enemy territory could still take months. Hamas, meanwhile, has managed to continue to conduct near-daily operations, often in partnership with a diverse range of smaller factions.\n\nThe West Bank\n\nWhile the Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority (PA) retains nominal control over parts of the West Bank, President Mahmoud Abbas faces a major legitimacy crisis over popular resentment toward a lack of elections, accusations of corruption and growing Israeli military and settler activity that have eroded the PA's governing functions. The IDF has regularly conducted raids against suspected militia strongholds such as the Jenin refugee camp, while Hamas and other factions, including independent groups, have expanded their influence across the West Bank, including the disputed holy city of Jerusalem.\n\nWhile weapons smuggling into Gaza has long been an area of concern for Israel, the current war has drawn attention to the vast number of arms spread throughout the West Bank. Israel already exerts effective control over much of the territory, but a concerted offensive by groups here could further divert Israeli security resources otherwise needed to respond to other fronts.\n\nLebanon\n\nIsrael has already begun to double down on resources allocated to the northern front as a result of intensifying clashes with Hezbollah, which recently told Newsweek it was \"ready for anything.\" Israel has invaded Lebanon three times in the past and fought two major wars involving Hezbollah, but observers have warned that a new all-out conflict could be the most devastating yet for both sides.\n\nIsraeli officials have told Newsweek they estimate that Hezbollah has accumulated an arsenal of around 200,000 rockets, as well as mortars, drones, surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank missiles, precision-guided munitions, among other armaments. Widely considered to be larger and far more powerful than Hamas, a battle with Hezbollah could see major Israeli cities such as Tel Aviv and Haifa targeted with barrages of weaponry in a bid to overwhelm Israeli defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, in addition to Israeli troops facing constant fire on both sides of the border.\n\nSyria\n\nIsrael also shares a northern de facto border with Syria in the Golan Heights, much of which has been occupied and annexed by Israel without international recognition. Iran has expanded its influence across Syria since sending advisers and backing Hezbollah and a number of other militias in support of President Bashar al-Assad who has been embroiled in civil war against various rebel and jihadi groups since 2011, throughout which the IDF has conducted hundreds of airstrikes against suspected Iran-linked targets.\n\nSince the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Israeli officials have told Newsweek that a powerful coalition of such groups with close ties to Iran and Hezbollah known as the \"Imam Hossein Division\" have operated in both Syria and neighboring Lebanon. Launches against Israel have occurred occasionally, but an IDF airstrike that killed Iranian military officials at Tehran's consular building in Damascus sparked the first-ever direct exchange of attacks between Iran and Israel, exacerbating worries that the ongoing crisis in the Middle East could lead to an all-out battle between the two longtime rivals.\n\nIraq\n\nA number of the militias active in Syria hail from Iraq, which has emerged as a particularly active front since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While not directly bordering Israel, Iraq has been the source of frequent drone and missile attacks claimed by a coalition of factions known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which includes prominent groups such as the Nujaba Movement, Kataib Hezbollah, Ashab al-Kahf and others.\n\nUntil February, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq also claimed frequent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and neighboring Syria, but the deaths of three U.S. soldiers at the Jordan-Syria border saw a comprehensive set of U.S. strikes against militia positions in Iraq and Syria and a pause to the campaign. These groups have warned, however, that their halt was tied to promises of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, something the Pentagon has signaled no plans to carry out, and Iraqi militia leaders have repeatedly threatened to not only resume but expand their campaign against U.S. forces as strikes against Israel continue.\n\nYemen\n\nLocated even further away from Israel, Yemen's Ansar Allah, or Houthi movement, has established itself as one of the most disruptive \"Axis of Resistance\" factions of the ongoing war. The group, which has held the capital Sanaa since 2015 in defiance of a Saudi-led coalition supporting the country's internationally recognized government, has launched missiles and drones against Israel, sometimes in joint operations with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, as well as against commercial vessels across the region accused of violating the militia-imposed blockade of trade with Israel.\n\nAnsar Allah has also faced repeated strikes from the U.S. and the United Kingdom as a result of its maritime offensive. But the group has sought to fortify its military infrastructure with a system of underground complexes and has vowed to enter into direct war with both Israel and the U.S. if necessary.\n\nIran\n\nLike the U.S., Iran has repeatedly stated that it did not seek a regional war, and Iranian officials have told Newsweek that, even in the event of an Israeli war in Lebanon, they believed Hezbollah had sufficient strength to defeat their mutual foe. But the Islamic Republic's language has notably sharpened in recent months as the prospect of an Israel-Hezbollah war increasingly came into focus and Iranian officials have readily advertised their direct support for \"Axis of Resistance\" factions.\n\nIran possesses the largest and most advanced missile arsenal in the Middle East, only a fraction of which was put on display during the April barrage against Israel. While Israel has long displayed the ability to strike the Islamic Republic from within, an open war could test Israel, nearby Arab states and the U.S. like never before.\n\nOther Potential Fronts\n\nThe \"Axis of Resistance\" touts largely Shiite Muslim fighters from across the Middle East and beyond, to include units made up of primarily Afghan and Pakistani fighters. Both Taliban-led Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan have issued warnings against Israel over its offensive in Gaza but neither nation has displayed any willingness to get directly involved in the conflict and both governments also have their own complex histories with Iran and its allies.\n\nStill, the Iran-aligned coalition has sought to further broaden its horizons to include contingents from other countries such as Jordan and Bahrain, both close U.S. partners that have sought to crackdown on domestic activity suspected to have ties to Iran. Azerbaijan, a close Israeli partner that also borders Iran, has also contended with pro-Iran elements at home.\n\nAlso complicating the regional landscape has been a growing partnership between Iran and Russia, which has utilized Iranian drones in its ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia has traditionally sought to balance its relationships with Iran and Israel but has emerged as an increasingly vocal critic of Israel's campaign in Gaza and its airstrikes in Syria, where Moscow maintains troops and air defense systems.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_o_connor@newsweek.com", "name": "Tom O'Connor", "type":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThere is an increasingly real possibility of a full-scale war -- one that would have catastrophic consequences for people on both sides of the border. Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nBurn scars in Israel\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNumbers and weapons\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nLidman reported from northern Israel.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com",

Keep in mind that Russia also has a military presence in the northwest coastal region.\n\nDown in the south, meanwhile, Israel continues to blast Hezbollah as the situation escalates. Word through the grapevine says the United States is also on the verge of getting involve as it sends amphibious military ships to the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nShould signs appear of an imminent attack, Americans could have to be evacuated from the region.\n\n\"In the past few hours, warplanes attacked several Hezbollah targets, including a military site for the organisation in the Zabqin area, two operational infrastructure sites in the Khiam area, and a Hezbollah building in the al-Adissa [Odaisseh] area,\" reported Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

Should that happen, Israel would likely lose as its military forces (IDF) are stretched thinly right now with a heavy presence in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nThe general sentiment is that Hezbollah in Lebanon is a much different and much stronger force than Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In fact, any Iran-linked group in the Middle East will be a much tougher animal than Hamas, which means Israel's hands are about to be full.\n\nBack during the 2006 Lebanon war, reports emerged to suggest that the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) of Iran, also known as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, were presented on the ground in Lebanon to assist Hezbollah.\n\nSimply put, the entire Middle East will put Israel in their crosshairs the moment Israel launches an attack on Hezbollah. Then, all bets are off.\n\n\"This isn't our fight,\" noted one online commenter about the situation in the Middle East and how it pertains to Americans. \"This isn't the fight of the populace of western nations. It is the fight of the Zionist Occupied Governments of our nations. Not our problem.\"\n\n\"Israel went one kibbutz too far,\" wrote another. \"The world has had enough of their nonsense ... because of that, America will suffer the most.\"\n\nOthers criticized Netanyahu for his war hawk behavior with one calling him \"a maniacal moron\" and another calling him a \"psychopath.\"\n\n\"Is it just me or is Israel and its dual citizens causing chaos all over the world while playing the victim?\" asked another.\n\nfrom https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-07-03-iran-threatens-obliterating-war-israel-attacks-lebanon.html", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org",

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors":

Very few people anticipated that World War I would erupt, but it happened anyway. And very few people anticipated that World War II would erupt, but it happened anyway.\n\nAll throughout human history, there have been wars. Ever since the very beginning, it has just been a matter of time before major powers collide. Unfortunately, even though very alarming warning signals are flashing all around us, most of the population of the Western world seems absolutely clueless about what is really going on out there. Leaders all over the planet seem to have come down with a really bad case of \"war fever\", and preparations for apocalyptic showdowns are being made. The following are 10 signs that global war is rapidly approaching...\n\n#1 Politico is reporting that Israel and Hezbollah have both \"drafted battle plans\", and the Biden administration is convinced that \"intense fighting is likely to break out\"...\n\nMeanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah have drafted battle plans and are in the process of trying to procure additional weapons, according to two senior U.S. officials briefed on the intelligence.\n\nBoth sides have publicly said they do not want to go to war, but senior Biden officials increasingly believe that intense fighting is likely to break out despite efforts to try and prevent it.\n\nThe risk is higher now than at any other point in recent weeks, according to another senior U.S. official, who, like others in this story, was granted anonymity to speak freely about sensitive intelligence.\n\n#2 Iran is warning that there will be an \"obliterating war\" if the IDF enters southern Lebanon...\n\nIsrael will face an \"obliterating war\" if it embarks on \"full-scale military aggression\" against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran's Permanent Mission to the UN warned on Friday.\n\nThe announcement was made on Twitter.\n\n\"Albeit Iran deems as psychological warfare the Zionist regime's propaganda about intending to attack Lebanon, should it embark on full-scale military aggression, an obliterating war will ensue. All options, incl. the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,\" the post reads.\n\nBy \"all Resistance Fronts,\" Iran means not just Hezbollah and Hamas, but also the Houthi rebels in Yemen as well as other groups in Syria and Iraq.\n\n#3 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that a major with Iran is inevitable because he believes that the Iranians have plans to conquer the entire Middle East...\n\nNetanyahu emphasized that the fight against Iran's terror proxies is critical for other nations in the Middle East, as Iran aims to dominate the rest of the region, including Sunni Muslim nations.\n\n\"We also have to deter the other elements of the Iran terror axis. But we have to deal with the axis,\" Netanyahu explained. \"The axis doesn't threaten only us. It threatens you. It's on the march to conquer the Middle East.\"\n\n\"That means, actually, conquer. Conquer Saudi Arabia, conquer the Arabian Peninsula. It's just a question of time,\" he warned.\n\n#4 According to NBC News, the U.S. is moving military assets into position so that they can be \"ready to evacuate Americans\" once an all-out war erupts between Israel and Hezbollah...\n\nThe Pentagon is moving U.S. military assets closer to Israel and Lebanon to be ready to evacuate Americans as fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies, according to three U.S. defense officials and a former U.S. official familiar with the plans.\n\nThe USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship, and Marines from the 24th Expeditionary Unit, which is special operations capable, moved into the Mediterranean on Wednesday to join the dock landing ship USS Oak Hill and another ship in their amphibious ready group, according to the Marine Corps. The Wasp will operate in the eastern Mediterranean to be ready for a Military Assisted Departure and other missions, the officials said.\n\n#5 On Thursday, Hezbollah sent approximately 40 rockets into northern Israel...\n\nHezbollah launched a barrage of some 40 rockets at northern Israel on Thursday afternoon, in what the terror group said was a response to recent Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, including the killing of one of its operatives earlier in the day.\n\n#6 On Saturday, Israeli aircraft bombed several Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon...\n\nOn Saturday afternoon Israeli fighter jets struck a building in southern Lebanon's Houla where a group of Hezbollah operatives were gathered, the military said. The IDF said the operatives were spotted by troops of the 869th Combat Intelligence Collection Unit, and a short while later the airstrike was carried out.\n\nAnother building used by Hezbollah in Houla was also struck, the IDF added. It published footage of the strikes.\n\n#7 I know that I wrote about this last week, but I couldn't leave this particular item out of this article. Apparently Joe Biden is thinking about approving a plan that would \"allow US military contractors to deploy to Ukraine\"...\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration is moving toward a plan that would allow US military contractors to deploy to Ukraine for the first time in a limited capacity, CNN reported.\n\nFour US officials familiar with the matter told the outlet that a policy is being worked on to allow the Pentagon to issue private contracts to send troops for the maintenance and repair of US-supplied systems in Ukraine.\n\n#8 Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly interested in developing a coalition of nations that would \"rival the West and NATO\"...\n\nRhetoric from Vladimir Putin about a Eurasian security coalition is part of a Kremlin plan to create a group of Moscow-friendly countries to rival the West and NATO, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has said.\n\nThe assessment by the Washington, DC think tank follows Putin's visit to North Korea which, one international security expert told Newsweek, has \"deepened an already intensifying relationship of convenience\" between Moscow and Pyongyang.\n\n#9 Putin is also warning that Russia will need to begin production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons systems...\n\nRussia must respond to the actions of the United States and it seems that it is necessary for the country to start the production of intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) strike systems, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.\n\n\"We need to respond to this and make decisions about what we will have to do in this direction next. Apparently, we need to start manufacturing these systems and then, based on the actual situation, make decisions about where - if necessary to ensure our safety - to deploy them,\" Putin said at an operational meeting with the permanent members of the Russian Security Council.\n\nOf course, the Russians already have more tactical nuclear weapons than anyone else in the world by a large margin, and they have developed brand new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles which are so advanced that they aren't even worth comparing to the Minuteman missiles that the U.S. is depending on which first went into service in the 1970s.\n\n#10 A very influential figure in Russian foreign policy circles is suggesting that the Russians should actually detonate a nuclear device in order to show the world how serious they are...\n\nDmitry Suslov, a top figure at the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defence Policy, has put forward the idea of Russia carrying out a \"demonstrative\" nuclear detonation, a move that could prompt the start of World War 3. This alarming suggestion arises as tensions with the West intensify due to Ukraine's use of Western-supplied weaponry against Russian forces.\n\nSuslov's think tank, known to occasionally sway government policy, made this proposal public shortly after President Vladimir Putin delivered a grave warning to NATO countries. Putin warned that if Ukraine were to employ Western arms for attacks on Russian soil, it could spark a worldwide crisis, reinforcing his point with threats of severe repercussions.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this is happening at a time when 72 percent of U.S. voters believe that the guy with his finger on the nuclear button does not have \"the mental or cognitive health to serve as president\"...\n\nA sweeping section of registered voters do not believe President Joe Biden has the mental and cognitive health to serve a second term as president after his unsteady debate performance last week, according to a new poll.\n\nThe CBS/You Gov national survey conducted in the days after the debate found that 72% of voters do not believe Biden has the mental or cognitive health to serve as president, as well as nearly half of his own party. That's up seven points from the beginning of June.\n\nWe are in far more trouble than most people realize.\n\nAnd it is far later than most people think that it is.\n\nI just wish that we could get more people to wake up. We are literally stumbling into an apocalyptic global war, and once we are in the middle of it there will not be any way to go back and get a second chance to do things over.\n\nMichael's new book entitled \"Chaos\" is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com, and you can subscribe to his Substack newsletter at michaeltsnyder.substack.com.\n\nAbout the Author: Michael Snyder's new book entitled \"Chaos\" is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com.

Some fear the fires sparked by a larger conflict would also cause irreversible damage to the land.\n\nCharred remains in Lebanon\n\nIn Israel, images of fires sparked by Hezbollah's rockets have driven public outrage and spurred Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to declare last month that it is \"time for all of Lebanon to burn.\"\n\nColumn: Janet Jackson surprises St. Louis dance class, and I was there Ramsay's Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay is worse than bad.

He must end it.\n\nMuch of it was already burning.\n\nFires in Lebanon began in late April -- earlier than the usual fire season -- and have torn through the largely rural areas along the border.\n\nThe Sunni town of Chebaa, tucked in the mountains on Lebanon's southeastern edge, has little Hezbollah presence, and the town hasn't been targeted as frequently as other border villages. But the sounds of shelling still boom regularly, and in the mountains above it, formerly oak-lined ridges are charred and bare.\n\nIn a cherry orchard on the outskirts of town, clumps of fruit hang among browned leaves after a fire sparked by an Israeli strike tore through. Firefighters and local men -- some using their shirts to beat out flames -- stopped the blaze from reaching houses and U.N. peacekeeper center nearby.\n\n\"Grass will come back next year, but the trees are gone,\" said Moussa Saab, whose family owns the orchard. \"We'll have to get saplings and plant them, and you need five or seven years before you can start harvesting.\"\n\nSaab refuses to leave with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. They can't afford to live elsewhere, and they fear not being able to return, as happened to his parents when they left the disputed Chebaa Farms area -- captured from Syria by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Lebanon.\n\nBurn scars in Israel\n\nThe slopes of Mount Meron, Israel's second-highest mountain and home to an air base, were long covered in native oak trees, a dense grove providing shelter to wild pigs, gazelles, and rare species of flowers and fauna.\n\nNow the green slopes are interrupted by three new burn scars -- the largest a few hundred square meters -- remnants of a Hezbollah explosive drone shot down a few weeks ago. Park rangers worry that devastation has just begun.\n\n\"The damage this year is worse a dozen times over this year,\" said Shai Koren, of the northern district for Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nLooking over the slopes of Meron, Koren said he doesn't expect this forest to survive the summer: \"You can take a before and after picture.\"\n\nNumbers and weapons\n\nSince the war began, the Israeli military has tracked 5,450 launches toward northern Israel. According to Israeli think tank the Alma Research and Education Center, most early launches were short-range anti-tank missiles, but Hezbollah's drone usage has increased.\n\nIn Lebanon, officials and human rights groups accuse Israel of firing white phosphorus incendiary shells at residential areas, in addition to regular artillery shelling and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israeli military says it uses white phosphorus only as a smokescreen, not to target populated areas. But even in open areas, the shells can spark fast-spreading fires.\n\nThe border clashes began Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. There, more than 37,000 have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel to open what it calls a \"support front\" for Hamas, to pull Israeli forces away from Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded, and attacks spread across the border region. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed. In Lebanon, more than 450 people -- mostly fighters, but also 80-plus civilians and noncombatants -- have been killed.\n\nExchanges have intensified since early May, when Israel launched its incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. That coincided with the beginning of the hot, dry wildfire season.\n\nSince May, Hezbollah strikes have resulted in 8,700 hectares (about 21,500 acres) burned in northern Israel, according to Israel's Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nEli Mor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said drones, which are much more accurate than rockets, often \"come one after another, the first one with a camera and the second one will shoot.\"\n\n\"Every launch is a real threat,\" Mor added.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) have burned due to Israeli strikes, said George Mitri, of the Land and Natural Resources program at the University of Balamand. In the two years before, he said, Lebanon's total area burned annually was 500 to 600 hectares (1,200 to 1,500 acres).\n\nFire response\n\nSecurity concerns hamper the response to a fire's first crucial hours. Firefighting planes are largely grounded over fears they'll be shot down. On the ground, firefighters often can't move without army escorts.\n\n\"If we lose half an hour or an hour, it might take us an extra day or two days to get the fire under control,\" said Mohammad Saadeh, head of the Chebaa civil defense station. The station responded to 27 fires in three weeks last month -- nearly as many as in a normal year.\n\nOn the border's other side, Moran Arinovsky used to be a chef and is now deputy commander of the emergency squad at Kibbutz Manara. With about 10 others, he's fought more than 20 fires in the past two months.\n\nMor, of Israel's Fire and Rescue, said firefighters often must triage.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to give up on open areas that are not endangering people or towns,\" Mor said.\n\nThe border areas are largely depopulated. Israel's government evacuated a 4-kilometer strip early in the war, leaving only soldiers and emergency personnel. In Lebanon, there's no formal evacuation order, but large swathes have become virtually uninhabitable.\n\nSome 95,000 people in Lebanon and 60,000 people in Israel have been displaced for nine months.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nehemia didn't evacuate, and Efrat Eldan Schechter said some days she watches helplessly as plumes of smoke grow closer to home.\n\n\"There's a psychological impact, the knowledge and feeling that we're alone,\" she said, because firefighters can't access certain areas.\n\nIsrael's cowboys, who graze beef cattle in the Golan Heights, often band together to fight blazes when firefighters cannot arrive quickly.\n\nSchechter noted that news footage of flames tearing across hillsides has focused more attention on the conflict in her backyard, instead of solely on the Gaza war. \"Only when the fires started, only then we are in the headlines in Israel,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that as fighting in Gaza winds down, Israel will send more troops to its northern border. That could open a new front and raise the risk of more destructive fires.\n\nOn Thursday, Israel's Fire and Rescue Service said it was tackling fires in 10 separate areas sparked by barrages of missiles fired by Hezbollah in retaliation for an Israeli strike that killed one of its top commanders the day before.\n\nKoren says natural wildfires are a normal part of the forest's lifecycle and can promote ecodiversity, but not the fires from the conflict. \"The moment the fires happen over and over, that's what creates the damage,\" he said.\n\nLidman reported from northern Israel.\n\n0

The US has been leading a diplomatic push for them to de-escalate the situation.\n\nHowever, Israeli officials have repeatedly said they are prepared to take military action in the absence of a diplomatic resolution, and the Israel Defense Forces said two weeks ago that it had approved \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon\".\n\nIsrael's defence minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that Israel would \"reach a state of full readiness to take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength\".\n\nHe added: \"We prefer an arrangement, but if reality forces us, we will know how to fight.\"\n\nHizbollah has lost more than 320 fighters since the start of hostilities last October, according to an FT tally. They include a few dozen mid- to high-ranking officers, a person familiar with the group's operations told the FT last month.\n\nMore than 90 Lebanese civilians have also been killed, according to FT calculations, while in northern Israel, at least 18 soldiers and 11 civilians have died in cross-border fire.\n\nHizbollah officials have repeatedly said they were not seeking an all-out war with Israel. But they have insisted they will not stop firing until there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn an effort to break the deadlock in Gaza, US President Joe Biden in May set out a three-stage plan for ending the war, which has become the deadliest in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and fuelled a humanitarian catastrophe in the territory.\n\nBut talks brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US on a deal to free the roughly 120 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas and end the fighting in Gaza have been deadlocked, with Israel resisting demands from Hamas that any deal lead to a permanent ceasefire.\n\nIsrael said on Wednesday that it had received Hamas's response to Biden's proposal and was \"evaluating\" it. Netanyahu and other officials are expected to discuss the details at a meeting later on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Ff2d0c649-48cc-45d4-ab5f-5fcb5e8feaa7.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698567", "eventUri": "eng-9698567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1212, "textEnd": 1221}], "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Keep in mind that Russia also has a military presence in the northwest coastal region.\n\nDown in the south, meanwhile, Israel continues to blast Hezbollah as the situation escalates. Word through the grapevine says the United States is also on the verge of getting involve as it sends amphibious military ships to the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nShould signs appear of an imminent attack, Americans could have to be evacuated from the region.\n\n\"In the past few hours, warplanes attacked several Hezbollah targets, including a military site for the organisation in the Zabqin area, two operational infrastructure sites in the Khiam area, and a Hezbollah building in the al-Adissa [Odaisseh] area,\" reported Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

Should that happen, Israel would likely lose as its military forces (IDF) are stretched thinly right now with a heavy presence in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nThe general sentiment is that Hezbollah in Lebanon is a much different and much stronger force than Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In fact, any Iran-linked group in the Middle East will be a much tougher animal than Hamas, which means Israel's hands are about to be full.\n\nBack during the 2006 Lebanon war, reports emerged to suggest that the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) of Iran, also known as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, were presented on the ground in Lebanon to assist Hezbollah.\n\nSimply put, the entire Middle East will put Israel in their crosshairs the moment Israel launches an attack on Hezbollah. Then, all bets are off.\n\n\"This isn't our fight,\" noted one online commenter about the situation in the Middle East and how it pertains to Americans. \"This isn't the fight of the populace of western nations. It is the fight of the Zionist Occupied Governments of our nations. Not our problem.\"\n\n\"Israel went one kibbutz too far,\" wrote another. \"The world has had enough of their nonsense ... because of that, America will suffer the most.\"\n\nOthers criticized Netanyahu for his war hawk behavior with one calling him \"a maniacal moron\" and another calling him a \"psychopath.\"\n\n\"Is it just me or is Israel and its dual citizens causing chaos all over the

The Israeli military said the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah sent about 200 rockets and 20 drones carrying explosives into Israel on Thursday, the day after Israel assassinated the Hezbollah commander Mohammed Naima Nasser.\n\n\"This is the worst sequence of bombing we've had,\" said Dean Sweetland, who has lived for eight years on Kibbutz Malkiya, which sits meters from the Lebanon border. \"Nothing even comes close to what's happened here in the last two days.\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said that its air defenses and fighter jets intercepted \"a number\" of the projectiles and that its forces had struck Hezbollah military structures in the areas of Ramyeh and Houla in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe IDF did not report any injuries from the attack and had not released any estimates of damages to property as of 3:40 p.m.\n\nSweetland, a 53-year-old landscaper, said he was sitting on his back patio high atop a mountain facing east on Wednesday afternoon, a few hours after Nasser's killing, and saw scores of missiles flying overhead, then smoke from where many landed at various points across the Upper Galilee. \"It was a crazy couple of hours,\" he said.\n\nAt about 10 a.m. Thursday, Sweetland said he again heard the \"whish, whish, whishing\" of missiles overhead, then sirens blaring and red alert alarms buzzing on his phone steadily for almost two hours. Video he shot on his phone shows explosions on farms and other kibbutzim throughout the region.\n\n\"It wouldn't stop, like one boom after the other, boom, boom, boom, and it hasn't stopped yet,\" he said at noon Israel time Thursday after emerging from a bomb shelter. \"This conflict has entered another level this week and there's no sign of it stopping.\"\n\nChris Coyle, 51 and an immigrant from Scotland, said he spent a good part of Thursday morning under his kitchen table wearing a helmet and flak jacket. The afternoon before, he'd been in a Kiryat Shmona park feeding the local nutria - a type of water rat that can grow to the size of a dog - when the rockets started exploding, and took cover under a eucalyptus tree.\n\n\"This has gotten to be a daily occurrence for us who stayed behind,\" Coyle said. \"We just want our lives back.\"\n\nEliezer Haziza, a farmer, was at morning minyan in a Kiryat Shmona synagogue when Thursday's barrage started. The group took cover in a bunker under a Chabad House.\n\n\"They got really mad today,\" he said of Hezbollah. \"This is our reality here.\"\n\nAll three men plan said they nonetheless planned to stay

"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Hizbollah said an Israeli air strike killed a senior commander in south Lebanon on Wednesday, the Iran-backed movement's second such loss in recent weeks.\n\nHizbollah has traded near daily cross-border fire with the Israeli army since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, triggering war in Gaza, but an uptick in bellicose rhetoric from both sides in recent weeks has raised fears of all-out war.\n\n\"A Hizbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon was killed\" in an \"Israeli strike on a car in Tyre\", a source told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nHizbollah said that \"commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser\", also known as \"Hajj Abu Naameh\" had been killed, and also announced the death of a second fighter.\n\nAnother source close to the group, also requesting anonymity, confirmed Nasser was killed in the strike in Tyre, and said he was the third senior Hizbollah commander to be killed in almost nine months of hostilities.\n\nLebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said \"an enemy drone targeted a car\" in Tyre, a coastal city around 20 kilometres from the border.\n\nThe first source said Nasser had the same rank as Taleb Abdallah, a commander killed in an Israeli strike last month who was described by a Lebanese military source at the time as the \"most important\" Hizbollah commander killed to date.\n\nThat strike prompted Hizbollah to intensify its attacks on Israeli targets, firing barrages of rockets across the border in the days that followed.\n\nIn January, a security source said an Israeli strike killed Wissam Hassan Tawil, another top commander from the group.\n\n'Prevent a conflagration'\n\nHizbollah announced a series of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Wednesday, while the NNA reported Israeli attacks in other parts of south Lebanon.\n\nThe commander's death followed a relative easing of cross-border exchanges over the past week, after threats on both sides had intensified.\n\nFears the violence, so far largely restricted to the border area, could turn into all-out war have sparked a flurry of diplomatic efforts to lower tensions.\n\nOn Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a \"conflagration\" between Israel and Hizbollah.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made repeated visits to Lebanon in recent months, was due in Paris on Wednesday where he was due to meet with Macron's Lebanon envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nIran warned on Saturday that \"all resistance fronts\" would confront Israel if it attacks Lebanon.\n\nLast week, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said his country did not want war in Lebanon but could send it back to the \"Stone Age\" if diplomacy failed.\n\nHizbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned in June that \"no place\" in Israel would be spared in the event of all-out war, and threatened nearby Cyprus if it opened its airports to Israel.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 495 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.", "source": {"uri": "jordantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jordan Times"}, "authors": [],

Except I'm not. The Israel Defence Forces have scrambled the GPS of everyone within about an hour's drive of the Israel-Lebanon border. The same navigation system that tells my iPhone its location is the same navigation system that Hezbollah could use to identify targets in northern Israel. They've been firing across the border since 7 October, and the Israelis are fed up. They've evacuated 80 kibbutzim, nine villages, three community centres and two Arab villages. The phrase that ministers use to describe the displaced is 'refugees in their own country'. The offensive in Gaza is winding down, and after that - says an official - 'we are ready to deal with Lebanon'.\n\nThis week the British embassy advised people to leave Lebanon if they can. Officials sound resigned, prepared, perhaps raring for war on the northern front: 'We are talking weeks, maybe days.' I don't know how literally to take them. As you get farther north, it gets quieter and quieter and the cars all start coming the other way. The evacuated areas - among vineyards and fields where bananas and avocados grow - have become known as 'ghost towns'. Out in the field in 32\u00b0C heat, I can only hear one thing. Crickets.\n\nHezbollah has launched more than 10,000 rockets in the past nine months, and the Iron Dome has had little trouble intercepting them. The anti-tank missiles are trickier to stop. Sirens can and do go off at any time. I'm with a group of journalists with the Europe Israel Press Association. We're told to get off the bus, lie down and cover our heads if the sirens go off. On the way to Matzuva, a kibbutz right on the border, the IDF suggests we change destination and go elsewhere. It doesn't matter that I'm not a soldier: 'When Hezbollah see people, they fire at them.'\n\nHezbollah is a more sophisticated enemy than Hamas - it has closer links with Iran, a giant arsenal of rockets, about 25,000 fighters and 30,000 reservists. But Israeli officials insist that they aren't scared. 'I sleep like a baby,' says a bespectacled IDF lieutenant colonel, who spends his days staring at the Lebanese mountains from a few miles away. If Israel has to turn north, 'what's happened in Gaza will be child's play'.\n\nIn the quiet northern town of Mateh Asher, a 15-minute drive from the border, Ishay Efroni never takes his hand off his massive gun. He's the head of security for the regional council. 'He looks scary but he's sweet,' says the mayor, chuckling. Efroni doesn't chuckle or smile though. The situation is intolerable, he says, especially for children. 'They had Covid for two years, and another year out of school because of Hezbollah.' If they don't go back on 1 September, they'll miss another year, he adds. In two weeks' time, Mateh Asher will host a raft-building competition for some of the children who've remained. 'They have to feel that life is in some way normal.'\n\nIsrael is prepared to strike deep into Lebanese territory if Hezbollah don't stop the attacks. 'If a rocket hits Haifa [a city in Israel's north], then something is going to happen to Beirut,' one official says. 'I won't say they'll go back to the Stone Age, but there will be a big problem with electricity.' The threat goes the other way too. Israeli research recently concluded that the Iron Dome could be overwhelmed by Hezbollah's arsenal, and a government electricity official said Israel would become 'unlivable' in if the power goes out. But the fear of Hezbollah's arsenal doesn't seem to frighten Israeli officials. Zohar Palti, a former head of the Mossad intelligence directorate, admits that Hezbollah could strike some tall buildings in Tel Aviv. 'But do you expect us to be paralysed?' he says.\n\nWe visit the kibbutz Nir Oz the next day. A quarter of its residents were killed or kidnapped on 7 October. A woman named Irit Lahav meets us. She spent more than seven hours hiding in her safe room that day, saying goodbye to her daughter. Her makeshift lock worked, and she somehow still lives here. We step over shattered glass and enter houses blackened by heat bombs. They stink. We're a two-minute drive from Gaza, and you can hear, every minute or so, the terrifying, throbbing sound of Israeli cannon-fire. The amount of agony crammed in these few square miles is vast.\n\nTheresa May once said there are 'girl jobs' and 'boy jobs'. There's no such thing in Israel. Many of the IDF soldiers I meet are young women, with American-ish accents. One I speak to is fascinated I'm from London. She's been there a few times: 'I want to go back!' I try to convince her that her life is slightly more interesting than mine at the moment. She has family in the UK, but grew up in Israel and was drafted to the IDF last year. She's just 18. She'll serve for a bit, but after the war is done, she wants to open a restaurant. 'I really, really hate war,' she says. 'But sometimes the only way to get peace is through force.'\n\nOn Tel Aviv beach, football-mad crowds gather to watch Italy vs Croatia on a big projector screen. I fall asleep to the sound of people playing beach volleyball and I wake up to the sound of people playing beach volleyball. Most Israelis I talk to sleep well. No one seems ready for the war that everyone expects. But they insist that they are.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angus_colwell@spectator.us", "name": "Angus Colwell", "type":

Hezbollah says its rockets and drone attacks are a showing of support for the Palestinian people and that it won't stop until the war in Gaza has ended.\n\nThe clashes, meanwhile, have had dire consequences for the people living along the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nThousands flee\n\nDaily airstrikes have forced about 150,000 people to flee their homes in the south, most of them to Marwanieh. Those who have the financial means and are lucky to find apartments, rent them. One group of people, though, has been staying at an old, abandoned hotel.\n\nHotel Montana is now home to about 60 families, according to Salam Nehme Baddredin, the head of the Committee for Crisis Management in the area.\n\nIts owner hit financial troubles in 2005 and had to sell the building to the local municipality. Four years ago, Hotel Montana was used as a COVID-19 quarantine center. Today, it serves as a shelter for families caught in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nThe three-story building with pink walls and marble floors has seen much better days, Baddredin said. When families started streaming in, it wasn't safe or livable, so the committee had to repair the water tanks and power lines with the help of international nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"Most people here have lost their homes,\" Baddredin explained. \"Some have lost relatives and neighbors. Initially, we thought this was going to be a temporary situation but, as the weeks turned into months, it slowly became clear that people are not going back.\"\n\nThis time is different\n\nOccupying a room on the second floor was 57-year-old Adnan Hassan Khoshaysh, his wife and daughter.\n\nThey fled the village of Khiam, which is just 3 miles away from Lebanon's border with Israel.\n\n\"Khiam is a dead place,\" Khoshaysh said. \"Everyone has left.\"\n\nFor three months, he refused to move out of his home, hoping that the war would end quickly, like it did many times in the past. Khoshaysh, having lived all his life on the border with Israel, has seen many wars. The last time he was displaced was in 2006 during the monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\n\"I love my village,\" he said, holding back tears. \"I didn't want to leave.\"\n\nIt was only after his house was struck directly that he realized he could no longer stay. So, he packed his bags and left reluctantly.\n\nHis wife, Um Ali, who had been urging him for weeks, said she was glad that he was finally out of danger.\n\nThis time, Khoshaysh explained, the fighting has gone on longer, and there is no end in sight. In fact, every day it seems like Israel and Hezbollah are inching closer to an all-out war.\n\nCalls to de-escalate\n\nIn recent days, the United States and Arab and European countries have tried to mediate between the two sides, urging them to de-escalate.\n\n\"Such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said as he met recently with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant at the Pentagon. \"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Khoshaysh, who hasn't been able to return to his home for five months, wonders if his olive and walnut trees are still standing. He thinks of his house, too, which was handed down to him from previous generations.\n\nBut that's not all he worries about. He said that he doesn't know the fate of his three cats: Loulou, Lashlousha and Mashmousha.\n\n\"They were born in my house,\" he said. \"I raised them, fed them and I became attached to them. Where are they now? Are they even alive?\"\n\nAt one point, one of their neighbors was able to return to pick up some things and he stopped by their home and left some opened cans of tuna for the cats, Um Ali said. He also took some videos.\n\nThe video shows the destruction of their home. The strikes hit their son's bedroom.\n\n\"When I see this,\" Um Ali said, \"I get goosebumps. We were so lucky no one was in the room at the time.\"\n\nRelatively safe\n\nLife at the Montana Hotel is not easy, Um Ali and her husband said. But at least it's safe. The respite allowed them to hold a small celebration for their daughter's wedding.\n\nUm Ali proudly showed a video of the ceremony -- the bride, in a large, flowy gown -- held the hand of her husband. Both were smiling and behind them there were giant wedding sparklers.\n\nDays in the decaying hotel can get long and boring, the couple said.\n\nSometimes, the displaced families get together, though, and sip coffee in the yard. They sing to keep up their morale. Sometimes, they cry for those who have been killed in this war.\n\nDespite the daily airstrikes, Khoshaysh and his wife said they have hope they will return soon, and he invites others to visit.\n\n\"You'll see with your own eyes what a beautiful house I have.\"", "source": {"uri": "admin.theworld.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The World from PRX"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Australian government over a possible war in Lebanon must be explained, Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham says.\n\nIsraeli ambassador Amir Maimon was reportedly summoned to a meeting in Canberra last month and warned his nation could not expect Australia's support if it went to war with listed terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThere has been tension between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah since the conflict in Gaza erupted, with almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nThe Australian government has also grown increasingly critical of Israel as civilian deaths in Gaza have mounted, and after an Australian aid worker was killed in an Israeli air strike described by Israel's president as an accident.\n\nIn a statement, a government spokesperson played down the meeting between Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts and Mr Maimon.\n\n\"Australian government ministers, assistant ministers and DFAT officials regularly meet with members of the diplomatic corps,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The assistant minister expressed Australia's concern about the risk of regional escalation, and continued civilian casualties.\"\n\nShadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham said it would be \"an outrageous abandonment of a democratic friend\" if the government had told Israel \"not to defend itself\" against Hezbollah.\n\n\"We do not wish to see any spreading of the current war in Gaza but the pressure needs to be on Hezbollah to stop their attacks while maintaining support for Israel's inherent right to self-defence,\" Senator Birmingham said.\n\n\"The Albanese government needs to come clean on the status of its support for Israel, which has repeatedly shifted and weakened despite terrorist groups still holding Israeli hostages, and seeking the destruction of Israel.\n\n\"If this meeting did take place as reported then Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong need to explain why they didn't front up to tell Israel themselves and why they're hiding the true extent of their abandonment of Israel from Australians.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

Hezbollah has said it will halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire between Hamas -- a fellow Iran-backed ally -- and Israel.\n\nThe United States has rallied world support behind a plan that would see the release of all of the scores of hostages still held by the militant group in return for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But until now, neither side appears to have fully embraced it.\n\nHamas suggested \"amendments\" last month, some of which the U.S. said were unworkable, without providing specifics. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed that the original proposal was an Israeli one, but has raised doubts over whether it would end the war -- a key Hamas demand.\n\nHezbollah fires over 200 rockets into Israel after killing of senior commander\n\nBEIRUT (AP) -- The Lebanese Hezbollah group says it has launched over 200 rockets at several military bases in Israel in retaliation for a strike that killed one of its senior commanders.\n\nThe attack by the Iran-backed militant group on Thursday was one of the largest in the monthslong conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border, with tensions boiling in recent weeks.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets\" had entered its territory from Lebanon, many of which it said were intercepted. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIt acknowledged on Wednesday that it had killed Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who headed one of Hezbollah's three regional divisions in southern Lebanon, a day earlier.\n\nHours later, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. It launched more rockets on Thursday and said it had also sent exploding drones into several bases.\n\nBiden at 81: Often sharp and focused but sometimes confused and forgetful\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's conduct behind closed doors, in the Oval Office, on Air Force One and in meetings around the world is described in the same dual way by those who regularly see him in action.\n\nHe is often sharp and focused. But he also has moments, particularly later in the evening, when his thoughts seem jumbled and he trails off mid-sentence or seems confused. Sometimes he doesn't grasp the finer points of policy details. He occasionally forgets people's names, stares blankly and moves slowly around the room.\n\nBiden's occasional struggles with focus may not be unusual for someone his age. But at 81 years old and seeking another four years in the White House, the moments when he's off his game have taken on a fresh resonance following his disastrous debate performance against Republican Donald Trump. The president appeared pale, gave nonsensical answers, stared blankly and lost his train of thought.\n\nThe June 27 faceoff alarmed Democrats and his financial backers, in part, because Biden seemed so much worse than during the almost routine moments when he's less sharp. And that has raised questions about whether he's up for a campaign that's only going to get nastier and whether he can effectively govern for another four years if he wins.\n\n\"We understand the concerns. We get it,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week. But she insisted Biden has no intention of stepping away from the campaign. \"The president is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race.\"\n\nFACT FOCUS: Trump wasn't exonerated by the presidential immunity ruling, even though he says he was\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Tuesday misrepresented in a social media post what the U.S. Supreme Court's Monday ruling on presidential immunity means for his civil and criminal cases.\n\n\"TOTAL EXONERATION!\" he wrote in the post on his Truth Social platform. \"It is clear that the Supreme Court's Brilliantly Written and Historic Decision ENDS all of Crooked Joe Biden's Witch Hunts against me, including the WHITE HOUSE AND DOJ INSPIRED CIVIL HOAXES in New York.\"\n\nBut none of Trump's pending cases have been dismissed as a result of the ruling, nor have the verdicts already reached against him been overturned. The ruling does amount to a major victory for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, whose legal strategy has focused on delaying court proceedings until after the 2024 election.\n\nHere's a closer look at the facts.\n\nCLAIM: The Supreme Court's ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution means \"total exoneration\" for former President Donald Trump.\n\nLabour is hopeful and Conservatives morose as voters deliver their verdict on UK's election day\n\nLONDON (AP) -- British voters are picking a new government Thursday in a parliamentary election that is widely expected to bring the Labour Party to power against a gloomy backdrop of economic malaise, mounting distrust in institutions and a fraying social fabric.\n\nA jaded electorate is delivering its verdict on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party, which has been in power since 2010. Polls opened at 7 a.m.\n\nSunak made the short journey from his home to vote at Kirby Sigston Village Hall in his Richmond constituency. He arrived with his wife, Akshata Murty, and walked hand-in-hand into the village hall, which is surrounded by rolling fields.\n\nThe center-left Labour Party led by Keir Starmer has had a steady and significant lead in opinion polls for months, but its leaders have warned against taking the election result for granted, worried their supporters will stay home.\n\n\"Change. Today, you can vote for it,\" he wrote Thursday on the X social media platform.\n\nRussian-linked cybercampaigns put a bull's-eye on France. Their focus? The Olympics and elections\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Photos of blood-red hands on a Holocaust memorial. Caskets at the Eiffel Tower. A fake French military recruitment drive calling for soldiers in Ukraine, and major French news sites improbably registered in an obscure Pacific territory, population 15,000.\n\nAll are part of disinformation campaigns orchestrated out of Russia and targeting France, according to French officials and cybersecurity experts in Europe and the United States. France's legislative elections and the Paris Olympics sent them into overdrive.\n\nMore than a dozen reports issued in the past year point to an intensifying effort from Russia to undermine France, particularly the upcoming Games, and President Emmanuel Macron, who is one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters in Europe.\n\nThis story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe.\n\nHurricane Beryl roars toward Mexico after leaving destruction in Jamaica and eastern Caribbean\n\nPLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl ripped off roofs in Jamaica, jumbled fishing boats in Barbados and damaged or destroyed 95% of homes on a pair of islands in St. Vincent and the Grenadines before rumbling toward the Cayman Islands and taking aim at Mexico's Caribbean coast after leaving at least seven dead in its wake.\n\nWhat had been the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, weakened slightly but remained a major hurricane. Its eye was forecast to pass just south of the Cayman Islands overnight.\n\nMexico's popular Caribbean coast prepared shelters, evacuated some small outlying coastal communities and even moved sea turtle eggs off beaches threatened by storm surge, but in nightlife hotspots like Playa del Carmen and Tulum tourists still took one more night on the town.\n\nMexico's Navy patrolled areas like Tulum telling tourists in Spanish and English to prepare for the storm's arrival.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, the storm's center was about 500 miles (800 kilometers) east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (32 kph). Beryl was forecast to make landfall in a sparsely populated area of lagoons and mangroves south of Tulum in the early hours of Friday, probably as a Category 2 storm. Then it was expected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula and restrengthen over the warm Gulf of Mexico to make a second strike on Mexico's northeast coast near the Texas border.\n\nIndia is likely undercounting heat deaths, affecting its response to increasingly harsh heat waves\n\nBENGALURU, India (AP) -- Months of scorching temperatures sometimes over 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) in parts of India this year -- its worst heat wave in over a decade -- left hundreds dead or ill. But the official number of deaths listed in government reports barely scratches the surface of the true toll and that's affecting future preparations for similar swelters, according to public health experts.\n\nIndia now has a bit of respite from the intense heat, and a different set of extreme weather problems as monsoon rain lashes the northeast, but for months the extreme heat took a toll on large swaths of the country, particularly in northern India, where government officials reported at least 110 heat-related deaths.\n\nPublic health experts say the true number of heat-related deaths is likely in the thousands but because heat is often not listed as a reason on a death certificate many heat deaths don't get counted in official figures. The worry, they say, is that undercounting the deaths means the heat wave problem isn't as prioritized as it should be, and officials are missing out on ways to prepare their residents for the scorching temperatures.\n\nAll of India's warmest years on record have been in the last decade. Studies by public health experts found that up to 1,116 people have died every year between 2008 and 2019 due to heat.\n\nAs part of his work in public health, Srinath Reddy, the founder of the Public Health Foundation of India, has advised state governments on how to factor in heat when recording deaths.\n\nThe questions about Biden's age and fitness are reminiscent of another campaign: Reagan's in 1984\n\nThe age question for presidential candidates is more than four decades old. President Ronald Reagan answered it with a pledge to resign if he became impaired, and later with a clever joke that reset his campaign from a stumbling debate performance to a 49-state landslide and a second term.\n\n\"I will not make age an issue of this campaign,\" Reagan said to the question he knew was coming in perhaps the most famous mic-drop moment in campaign history. \"I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nThe audience roared, even Democratic Vice President Walter Mondale laughed -- and Reagan's reelection was back on track.\n\nToday, Democratic President Joe Biden, 81, is struggling for such a redemptive moment after a disastrous debate performance against Republican former president Donald Trump, 77. Those 90 minutes last week set off alarms among Democrats hoping Biden would keep Trump from returning to the White House -- and heightened concern among voters long skeptical of how either elderly man would govern a complex nation of more than 330 million people for four more years.\n\nMore than two dozen people who have spent time with the president privately described him as often sharp and focused. But he also has moments, particularly later in the evening, when his thoughts seem jumbled and he trails off mid-sentence or seems confused, they said. Sometimes he doesn't grasp the finer points of policy details.

It's the bombs bursting in air. It's the rockets' red glare. That's how people show their pride and patriotism,\" Julie Heckman of the American Pyrotechnics Association told The Associated Press.\n\nAll signs pointed to big celebrations: The Transportation Security Administration reported that a record-breaking nearly 3 million people traveled through airports in a single day last week, and that figure is expected to be broken this week. And AAA projected that 60.6 million people will travel by car during the holiday period.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors":

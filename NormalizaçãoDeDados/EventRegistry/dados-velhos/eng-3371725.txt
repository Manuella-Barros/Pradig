He described her as very committed, often speaking her mind about the boys' and their teams' performances.\n\n\"She was not negative. She was always positive,\" he said in a phone interview.

The boys and their father, a policeman, were unhurt, the club president, Arnould Partoens, told The Associated Press. But Belgium officials confirmed that the mother was among the 13 people killed in Thursday's attack in Barcelona. Partoens said the family was on vacation in Barcelona.\n\nThere was also another fatality -- taking the overall total to 14 -- in a related attack late Thursday in the popular seaside town of Cambrils, south of Barcelona.\n\nFrance, already struck repeatedly by terror attacks on its own soil, again was hit hard, counting 26 of its citizens among the more than 100 people injured in the Spanish attacks. The French Foreign Ministry said at least 11 were seriously hurt. The Paris prosecutors' office quickly opened its own investigation, bringing France's domestic security agency in to assist.\n\nItaly said two Italians were among the dead. One appeared to be a young father from Legnano, a town in northern Italy.\n\nGerman Foreign Ministry counted at least 13 Germans injured -- some \"so seriously that they are still fighting for their lives,\" said spokesman Martin Schaefer.\n\nTwo Australian women, including one traveling on a British passport, were seriously injured, and two Australian men were treated for injuries in hospital but then discharged, said Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.\n\nA 5-year-old Irish boy suffered a broken leg and his father was also injured, according to the Irish government. They were part of a family of four celebrating the boy's birthday.\n\nRomania's foreign ministry says three Romanians are among the injured. All three were hospitalized, and the ministry said that two are in a stable condition while the third suffered light injuries.\n\nLorne Cook in Brussels contributed.", "id": "9898426", "details": {},

Biden took the 2020 contest by a margin of 74 electoral votes, with victories in the pivotal states of Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia coming from a cumulative advantage of about 44,000 votes.\n\n\"I think that the Biden campaign is deliberately playing a faux game by talking about [how] they're going to expand the map in Florida and North Carolina,\" LaCivita said in a telephone interview with NBC News. \"But we have a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.\"\n\nThe top lines of the internal polling shared with donors are relatively consistent with sparse public surveys that show Biden with a small edge in Virginia, while Trump's advantage in his own polling in Minnesota is at odds with the few public surveys in that state.

In the six-way trial in Minnesota, which includes four independent candidates, Trump and Biden were tied at 40% apiece, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 9%, he said.

And, in a four-way race, Biden had a 42%-to-41% advantage over Trump.\n\nTrump aides declined to make the full surveys, including their methodology, available to NBC News.

And, in a four-way race, Biden had a 42-41% advantage over Trump.\n\nTrump aides declined to make the full investigations, including their methodology, available to NBC News. Campaigns often use the promise of playing offense in new territory to entice donors to give money to support these efforts.\n\n\"The Trump team has so little campaign or infrastructure to talk about it, they resort to leaking memos that say the polls we paid for show us winning, but don't ask us to show you the 'entire poll Sure, guys,' Biden campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said. .\n\n\"While we have 150 offices open with hundreds of staff in key battlegrounds, the RNC is closing offices and losing money in legal fees,\" she added. \"Joe Biden has hit every battlefield at least once, while Trump in the courtroom or on the golf course. Well, see how that translates in November.\n\nJonathan Allen reported from Washington, D.C.; Matt Dixon of Orlando, Fla.; and Olympia Sonnier, Dasha Burns and Abigail Brooks of Palm Beach,

Meanwhile in Virginia, Biden leads only by 4 points against Trump (48 to 44 percent). It is unclear what the margin of error of this internal polling was since Trump aides declined to give the full surveys to NBC News.\n\nIn response, Biden's campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt told NBC News, \"Trump's team has so little campaign or infrastructure to speak of they're resorting to leaking memos that say 'the polls we paid for show us winning, don't ask us to show you the whole poll though.' Sure, guys.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's and Biden's campaigns via email for comment.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Minnesota by over 230,000 votes (52.6 to 45.4 percent). Minnesota has voted blue since former President Jimmy Carter's election in 1976, which is the longest streak of its kind, except for Washington D.C. Meanwhile, Biden took Virginia by over 450,000 votes in 2020 (54.3 to 44.2 percent). Virginia was mostly a Republican stronghold from the 1950s into the early 2000s, but Democrats have won the last three elections.\n\nWhat Public Polls Show\n\nAccording to public polling, Biden is still leading Trump by a few points in Minnesota. In a KSTP/SurveyUSA poll conducted from April 3 to 7, which surveyed 825 Minnesota adults, Biden was ahead of Trump by 2 points (44 to 42 percent). However, the margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, like Trump's internal surveys show, Biden remains ahead in Virginia. According to a poll conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR) at Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia, from February 11 to 19, Biden was leading Trump by 4 points (47 to 43 percent).

But Biden and the Democratic National Committee combined raked in roughly $90 million in March. And according to campaign disclosures, the president had more than twice as much money in his campaign coffers as the Republican challenger and predecessor in the White House as of the beginning of April.\n\nBut Trump and the RNC's fundraising has soared since the former president clinched the 2024 GOP nomination in March, and his top political advisers repeatedly insist they'll have enough campaign cash to compete with Biden.\n\nVP STAKES: TRUMP MEETING WITH POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES THIS WEEKEND\n\n\"President Donald J. Trump is not only winning across every battleground state, but we are raising the resources necessary to deliver a victory in November,\" Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement Saturday that announced the April haul.\n\n\"With half of funds raised coming from small dollar donors, it is clear that our base is energized. The Republican Party is united, and voters nationwide are ready to FIRE Joe Biden and elect President Donald J. Trump,\" they added.\n\nHAS BIDEN'S BUMP AGAINST TRUMP FLATLINED?\n\n\"Our team will continue working every day to exceed expectations, raise the funds we need, and build an unmatched party infrastructure to prove that President Trump's momentum is unstoppable,\" RNC chair Michael Whatley and co-chair Lara Trump added in the statement.\n\nWhatley, the former North Carolina GOP chair, and Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law, were installed as the new RNC leadership by Trump in early March as he effectively took over control of the party after clinching the nomination.\n\nThe fundraising figures were first revealed earlier on Saturday as Trump campaign officials gave a one-hour presentation to donors at the closed-door retreat, Republican sources confirmed to Fox News. The weekend confab is being held at the Four Seasons oceanfront resort in Palm Beach and at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, which is located a few miles north.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the presentation, which was first reported Saturday by the New York Times, Trump campaign officials emphasized that the former president is ahead in the key battleground states of Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, and competitive in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Biden narrowly carried all six of those states in 2020 to defeat Trump and win the White House.\n\nTrump's advisers also said they aimed to expand the map in Minnesota and Virginia, where they said their polling shows Trump competitive in states Biden comfortably won four years ago.\n\nThe RNC spring retreat provided a brief break for Trump from his criminal trial in New York City. The former president is being tried on nearly three-dozen state felony charges for allegedly falsifying business records in relation to hush-money payments during the 2016 election he made to Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about his alleged affair with the adult film actress.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied falsifying business records as well as the alleged sexual encounter with Daniels.", "source":

They also discussed an ambitious plan to make further inroads into Democratic territory.\n\nTrump's team argued that the former president could defeat Biden in the Democratic strongholds of Minnesota and Virginia.\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden's strategists harbor similar hopes, aspiring to flip North Carolina, where Republicans have won for the past three presidential elections.\n\nBiden's team also hopes to prevail in Florida, where Republicans have emerged victorious in the previous two presidential elections.\n\nIn 2020, Biden nabbed the presidency by a margin of 74 electoral votes. Wins in critical states like Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia helped propel him to victory.\n\n'I think that the Biden campaign is deliberately playing a faux game by talking about [how] they're going to expand the map in Florida and North Carolina,' Trump adviser Chris LaCivita told NBC.\n\n'But we have a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.'\n\n'We have a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota,' said Chris LaCivita (pictured0, a senior adviser for Trump\n\nIn a head-to-head matchup in Minnesota, Trump's team found that the former president would win with 49 percent to Biden's 46 percent\n\nThe internal polling conducted by Trump's team is fairly consistent with the few public surveys that depict Biden with a narrow lead in Virginia.\n\nHowever, the strategists' polling that evinces a Trump win in Minnesota is at variance with the limited surveys that have been completed in that state.\n\nBut both the state polls and the polls conducted by Trump's campaign fall within their margins of error.\n\nThis means one thing: A tight race in Minnesota and Virginia.\n\nLaCivita explained that they tested Trump's success in three different scenarios: in a head-to-head matchup with Biden, and in four-way and six-way races.\n\nIn a six-way competition in Minnesota, the strategists found that Trump and Biden were locked at 40 percent each, while Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on the Independent ticket, scored 9 percent.\n\nWhen the parameters were narrowed, and it became a race between four candidates, Trump beat Biden 46 percent to 41 percent.\n\nIn a head-to-head election, Trump still defeated Biden 49 percent to 46 percent.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won the presidency with the help of key victories in critical states like Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia\n\nBiden's team is also eyeing Republican territory, hoping to flip GOP bastions like North Carolina and Florida in November\n\nIn 2020, Biden prevailed in Minnesota by about seven percentage points. The state has not gone to Republicans since Richard Nixon trounced George McGovern in 1972.\n\nIn Virginia, Trump's top officials found that Biden pipped out a narrow victory over Trump in a six-way competition- Biden finished with 40 percent, Trump with 37 percent, and Kennedy with 8 percent.\n\nIn a four-candidate race, that margin narrowed even further, with Biden at 42 percent and Trump at 41 percent.\n\nIn a head-to-head matchup, Trump fared worse, finishing with 44 percent, while Biden scooped up 48 percent.\n\nTrump's strategists have not yet made their full surveys, as well as their methodology, available to the public.\n\nCampaigns traditionally make sweeping promises to donors- including winning in enemy territory- as an inducement for contributing larger sums of money.\n\nBiden's team issued a scathing statement in response to the meeting conducted by Trump's pollster and top advisers.\n\nIn Virginia, Trump's advisers found that Trump would currently finish with 44 percent to Biden's 48 percent- a gap that they hope to narrow before November\n\n'Trump's team has so little campaign or infrastructure to speak of they're resorting to leaking memos that say ''the polls we paid for show us winning, don't ask us to show you the whole poll though,''' Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said.\n\n'While we have 150 offices open with hundreds of staff across key battlegrounds, the RNC is closing offices and hemorrhaging money on legal fees,' Hitt continued.\n\n'Joe Biden has hit every battleground at least once, while Trump's in the courtroom or on the golf course.'\n\n'We'll see how that translates in November.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Charly Triballeau-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) say that they managed to pull in $76 million in April.\n\nThe campaign and RNC announced the mammoth fundraising haul on May 5. In a statement, they added that roughly half of that amount came from small dollar donations, rather than big donors. The full fundraising details will be revealed in filings later this month.\n\n\"President Donald J. Trump is not only winning across every battleground state, but we are raising the resources necessary to deliver a victory in November,\" Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement.\n\n\"With half of funds raised coming from small dollar donors, it is clear that our base is energized,\" they added. \"The Republican Party is united, and voters nationwide are ready to FIRE Joe Biden and elect President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley and co-chair Lara Trump said that the fundraising \"defied the pundits and naysayers.\"\n\n\"The American people are fed up with weak Joe Biden's failed economy, border crisis, and unacceptable responses to antisemitic violence spreading across college campuses nationwide,\" Mr. Whatley and Ms. Trump said.\n\n\"Our team will continue working every day to exceed expectations, raise the funds we need, and build an unmatched party infrastructure to prove that President Trump's momentum is unstoppable.\"\n\nIt comes as President Joe Biden and Democrats maintain a substantial fundraising lead over Republicans. President Biden's April fundraising figures have yet to be reported.\n\nAt the end of March, groups connected to President Trump's reelection campaign had about $110.3 million in cash on hand. That is significantly less than the $187.6 million President Biden could access at the same time.\n\nWith Republicans' April fundraising added to that total, Democrats still maintain a funding lead.\n\nHowever, because President Biden and the Democrats have not yet revealed their May fundraising, it's unclear how large the gap in funding between the two camps currently is.\n\nStill, it's a sign that the Trump campaign is catching up to the president after lagging in funding earlier this year.\n\nPresident Trump's announcement come after he hosted an event Palm Beach, Florida, this weekend during which wealthy donors heard from President Trump and his vice presidential hopefuls.\n\nFunding has been a key aspect of the 2024 electoral battle, which is set to become the longest general election face-off in U.S. history.\n\nPresident Trump's April fundraising haul shows that both sides of the aisle still have powerful sources of funding to rely on.\n\nIt comes after he, in early April, drew in $50.5 million from donors during a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThat dwarfed an earlier $26 million haul for President Biden during an event he hosted with former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nDespite lagging in fundraising, President Trump has enjoyed historic performance in polling.\n\nAccording to the most recent RealClearPolitics averages, President Trump is leading the national popular vote by 1.3 percent.\n\nPresident Trump also enjoys a polling lead in every swing-state -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- tracked by RealClearPolitics.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The full fundraising details will be revealed in filings later this month.\n\n\"President Donald J.

lead.\n\nHowever, because President Biden and the Democrats have not yet revealed their May fundraising, it's unclear how large the gap in funding between the two camps currently is.\n\nStill, it's a sign that the Trump campaign is catching up to the president after lagging in funding earlier this year.\n\nPresident Trump's announcement come after he hosted an event Palm Beach, Florida, this weekend during which wealthy donors heard from President Trump and his vice presidential hopefuls.\n\nFunding has been a key aspect of the 2024 electoral battle, which is set to become the longest general election face-off in U.S. history.\n\nPresident Trump's April fundraising haul shows that both sides of the aisle still have powerful sources of funding to rely on.\n\nThat dwarfed an earlier $26 million haul for President Biden during an event he hosted with former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nDespite lagging in fundraising, President Trump has enjoyed historic

And it's the only way they're going to win, in their opinion, and it's actually killing them. But it doesn't bother me.\"\n\nBefore making the comparison, Trump baselessly insisted that the various indictments against him and his allies in several states were being orchestrated by the Biden administration.\n\nHe said that, before his indictment, he was gentler on Biden, despite the outcome of the 2020 election. \"You have to respect the office of the presidency,\" Trump said. \"And I never talk to him like this.\"\n\nTrump entered the event to the recording of the national anthem that he made with a group of people arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob seeking to disrupt the certification of Biden's Electoral College win. Trump praised the song.\n\nIn his speech, he complained repeatedly about the criminal trial in Manhattan, to which he will return Monday, insisted that Democrats use \"welfare\" to cheat in elections and said he would need an attorney general with \"courage\" as he mocked his former attorney general, William Barr, who recently endorsed Trump after having spoken critically of Trump since the administration ended.\n\nTrump also indulged in conspiracy theories around his 2020 loss, and said that his hand-picked chair of the Republican National Committee, Michael Whatley, would prevent \"cheating\" in the upcoming election.\n\nTrump's comments about welfare to wealthy donors at the event called to mind remarks caught on tape by Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential run, when he dismissed 47% of voters as off-limits because they did not pay taxes.\n\n\"When you are Democrat, you start off essentially at 40% because you have civil service, you have the unions and you have welfare,\" Trump said Saturday. \"And don't underestimate welfare. They get welfare to vote, and then they cheat on top of that -- they cheat.\"\n\nBut Trump focused more on his own legal jeopardy, as he faces four different indictments and 88 criminal charges. On Friday, he had to listen in court to his former communications adviser, Hope Hicks, testify in the trial in which he is accused of falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments made to a porn actor.\n\nHe also spent several minutes acknowledging Rod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois whose lengthy prison sentence after being convicted of corruption charges was commuted by Trump, and who was at the RNC event.\n\nThe former president said that he came to the decision to issue the pardon after seeing Blagojevich's wife on television advocating his release, and that it was sealed that he would intervene when he learned that James Comey, the former FBI director whom Trump fired amid an investigation into Trump and his campaign, was connected to the Blagojevich investigation.\n\nTrump also mocked the physical appearance of Jack Smith, the special counsel who has indicted him twice.\n\n\"He's unattractive both inside and out,\" Trump said. \"This is one unattractive dude.\" He then used two expletives to describe Smith.\n\nHe praised House Speaker Mike Johnson, who, in his own remarks, said the nation needed \"a strong man\" in the White House.\n\nAt another point, Trump said that if anyone wanted to donate $1 million to the RNC on the spot, \"I will let you come up and speak.\" He sounded disappointed until someone accepted the invitation.\n\nTrump laid blame for the slim margin in the House on the issue of abortion, after he appointed the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, for which he has repeatedly taken credit. \"We had a rough thing because of the, you know, the issue of abortion largely. I think we would have had 45 seats more,\" Trump said.\n\nThe meandering remarks drew a sharp contrast with the specifics provided by Trump's top advisers at a presentation earlier Saturday. His advisers said that Trump's campaign and the party were projected to raise $76.2 million in April, according to two people who attended the briefing. Trump's three top advisers -- Susie Wiles, Chris LaCivita and Tony Fabrizio -- briefed donors, presented a slideshow and took questions afterward, the attendees said. The attendees were not authorized to speak publicly about the event, which was a closed-door briefing and gathering for party donors.\n\nTrump's advisers presented a bullish case for the candidate that included the possibility of expanding the electoral map to include the Democratic-leaning states of Minnesota and Virginia. They also noted that Trump has remained mostly ahead in polls even while being outspent by Biden, just as the former president was outspent in the primary by his rivals.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission will not receive fundraising reports until later this month, meaning the numbers can't be verified until then. In March, Trump and his allied groups reported raising $65.6 million -- a significant amount, but still well below what Biden and his affiliated outside groups have raised.\n\nThe slideshow presentation included three different Electoral College maps, the attendees said. The first was dismissed as \"the media's version,\" which included seven swing states: Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina across the Southwest and the Sun Belt, plus Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in the industrial north.\n\nA second slide described \"the actual current reality\" as only having three swing states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nAnd a third slide described an \"expanded reality\" in which both Minnesota and Virginia would be in play for Trump -- an ambitious view of states not widely seen as among the most competitive, but in which the Trump team insists the former president has gained ground.\n\nTrump's advisers also described some of their strategy for the general election in the presentation, including reaching 2016 levels of support with white voters and expanding support among Black and Latino voters, particularly among urban men.\n\nThe campaign strategists also outlined a plan to prevent the kinds of losses that occurred in 2022 that have been linked to the issue of abortion and the backlash from the Supreme Court's overturning of federal abortion rights before the midterm elections.\n\nTrump has proudly claimed ownership of the end of Roe v. Wade as the president who appointed a conservative supermajority to the highest court in the country. But he has struggled to answer questions about it since, waffling in discussions with advisers about whether to back a national ban, before ultimately saying in a video he posted a few weeks ago that it's up to states to decide how to handle the issue.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com",

It's a race that is at once deeply entrenched and highly in flux as many voters are only just beginning to embrace the reality of the 2024 campaign.Wars, trials, the independent candidacy of Robert Kennedy Jr. and deep divisions across America have injected extraordinary uncertainty into a race for the White House in which either man would be the oldest president ever sworn in on Inauguration Day. At the same time, policy fights over abortion, immigration and the economy are raging on Capitol Hill and in statehouses.Voters in denialHovering over it all is the disbelief of many voters, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Biden and Trump -- their respective parties' presumptive nominees -- will ultimately appear on the general election ballot this fall.\"I think we have an electorate that's going through the stages of grief about this election,\" said Sarah Longwell, who conducts regular focus groups with voters across the political spectrum as co-founder of Republican Voters Against Trump. \"They've done denial -- 'Not these two, can't possibly be these two.' And I think they're in depression now. I'm waiting for people to hit acceptance.\"Video below: Will Trump and Biden debate before November?Trump is in the midst of the first of potentially four criminal trials and facing felony charges. The Constitution does not prevent him from assuming the presidency if convicted -- or even if he is in prison.Biden, who will turn 82 years old just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77.Privately, Democratic operatives close to the campaign worry constantly about Biden's health and voters' dim perceptions of it. In recent weeks, aides have begun walking at Biden's side as he strolls to and from Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on the White House South Lawn in an apparent effort to help mask the president's stiff gait.Still, neither party is making serious contingency plans. Whether voters want to believe it or not, the general election matchup is all but set.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said many voters are recovering from what he called \"a knock-down, drag-out fight\" that was the 2020 presidential election.\"Many of them have not wrapped their heads around the fact that it is, in fact, going to be a rematch,\" Cooper said in an interview. \"When they do, I don't think there's any question that Joe Biden is going to win the day.\"Getting to 270 electoral votes -- The battleground statesEven before voters begin paying close attention, the political map in the fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency is already taking shape.Biden's campaign is increasingly optimistic about North Carolina, a state he lost by just 1 percentage point in 2020. Overall, the Democratic president's reelection campaign has several hundred staff in more than 133 offices in the seven most critical states: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and North Carolina.Trump's team has barely begun to roll out swing-state infrastructure, although he campaigned in Wisconsin and Michigan over the past week, sending a clear signal that he wants to block Biden's path to reelection via the Democrats' Midwestern \"blue wall.\"Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said Trump is making plans to invest new resources in at least two other Democratic-leaning states.Video below: Will pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses impact the 2024 elections?At a private donor retreat in Florida on Saturday, LaCivita discussed the campaign's plans to expand its electoral map into Virginia and Minnesota, based on the Trump team's growing optimism that both states are within reach.\"We have a real opportunity to expand the map here,\" LaCivita told The Associated Press. \"The Biden campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and in their 'vaunted ground game'. And they have nothing to show for it.\"Biden's campaign welcomed Trump's team to spend money in Democratic states. \"The Biden campaign is going to relentlessly focus on the pathway to 270 electoral votes, and that's what our efforts represent,\" campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.Biden has been spending far more aggressively on election infrastructure and advertising heading into the six-month stretch toward Election Day.In the eight weeks since Trump essentially clinched the Republican nomination, his campaign has spent virtually nothing on television advertising, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Outside groups aligned with Trump have spent just over $9 million.Over the same period, AdImpact found, Biden and his allies have spent more than $29 million spread across Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Trump's team has been unusually conservative, in part, to avoid the perceived mistakes of 2020, when his campaign essentially ran out of money and was forced to cut back on advertising in the election's critical final days, but also because it has struggled to reignite its appeal with small donors and because of the diversion of some dollars to the former president's legal defense.Trump's team insists it will soon ramp up its advertising and on-the-ground infrastructure, although LaCivita refused to offer any specifics.Voters underwhelmed with their optionsIt is clear that Biden and Trump have serious work to do to improve their standing with voters.While optimistic in public, Biden allies privately acknowledge that his approval ratings may be lower than Democrat Jimmy Carter's numbers at this point in his presidency. Trump's ratings are not much better.Public polling consistently shows that voters don't like their 2024 options.Only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be excited by Biden (21%) or Trump (25%) being elected president, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in March. Only about one-quarter of voters in the survey say they would be satisfied about each.A CNN poll conducted in April found that 53% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with the presidential candidates they have to choose from in this year's election.Another major wild card is Kennedy, a member of the storied political dynasty and an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who is running as an independent. Both major campaigns are taking him seriously as a potential spoiler, with Trump's allies notably ramping up their criticism of Kennedy in recent days.Biden's plan: Remind voters what Trump's presidency was likeFor now, Biden's team is most focused on reminding voters of Trump's divisive leadership. Three years after Trump left office, there is a sense that some voters may have forgotten what it was like with the former reality television star in the Oval Office -- or his efforts to overturn the 2020 election that have landed him in legal peril.\"The plan is reminding voters of what life was like with Trump and also demonstrating to voters that the ways in which the world feels uncertain to them now are not, in fact, caused by the president, but can actually be navigated by this president,\" Biden pollster Molly Murphy told the AP. \"Voters will trust his leadership and stewardship, knowing that things can be a lot worse if it's Donald Trump.\"Biden's team is also betting that fierce backlash to new restrictions on abortion, which Trump and Republicans have largely championed, will drive voters to Democrats like it did in the 2022 midterm election and 2023 state races.Video below: How Secretaries of State Work to Ensure Trust in ElectionsBut Biden's success also is dependent on the Democrat's ability to reassemble his winning coalition from 2020 at a time when enthusiasm is lagging among critical voting blocs, including Blacks, young voters and Arab Americans unhappy over the president's handling of the war in Gaza.Trump's plan: Turn his legal woes to his advantageTrump has been forced to adapt his campaign to his first criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors allege he committed financial fraud to hide hush money payments to a porn actor, Stormy Daniels, who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump. He denies her claim and has pleaded not guilty.For now, Trump is forced to attend the trial most weekdays. A verdict is likely still weeks away. And after that, he faces the prospect of more trials related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents. The Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump should be granted immunity, or partial immunity, for the actions he took while in office.Trump over the past week wedged in campaign stops around his court schedule, rallying voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, where the abortion debate is raging.Trump seemed to be searching for a way to lessen the political sting from the upheaval over the Supreme Court's overturning of national abortion rights. The former president suggested the issue will ultimately bring the country together as states carve out differing laws.\"A lot of bad things will happen beyond the abortion issue if you don't win elections, with your taxes and everything else,\" he told Michigan voters.Trump's camp privately maintains that his unprecedented trial in New York will dominate the news -- and voters' attention -- for the foreseeable future. His campaign has largely stopped trying to roll out unrelated news during the trial.Even if Trump were to be convicted by the New York jury, his advisers insist the fundamentals of the election will not change. Trump has worked aggressively to undermine public confidence in the charges against him. Meanwhile, more traditional issues work in his favor, including stubbornly high inflation and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the view of the Trump team.LaCivita said that such issues constantly reinforce Biden's weakness as \"the news of the day keeps getting worse.\"Both sides seem to agree that the dynamics of the race may yet shift dramatically based on any number of factors, from how the economy fares or the course of the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to crime or migration trends or other foreseen events. Potential candidate debates this fall could be another wild card.Such uncertainty, said Biden's battleground states director Dan Kanninen, can play to their favor.\"That dynamic is an opportunity as much as a challenge for us,\" he said, \"because we will have the resources, the infrastructure and the operation built to be engaging voters throughout all those difficult waters.\"\n\nWill Rikard, a 49-year-old father of two, was among several hundred Democrats who stood and cheered for Joe Biden as the first-term president delivered a fiery speech recently about the billions of dollars he has delivered to protect the state's drinking water.\n\nVideo above: Gen Z to boomers: What political issues do each generation care about?\n\nBut afterward, the Wilmington resident acknowledged he is worried about Biden's political standing in the looming rematch with former Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n\"There's not enough energy,\" Rikard said of Biden's coalition. \"I think people are gonna need to wake up and get going.\"\n\nExactly six months before Election Day, Biden and Trump are locked in the first contest in 112 years with a current and former president competing for the White House.

The Constitution does not prevent him from assuming the presidency if convicted -- or even if he is in prison.\n\nBiden, who will turn 82 years old just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77.\n\nPrivately, Democratic operatives close to the campaign worry constantly about Biden's health and voters' dim perceptions of it. In recent weeks, aides have begun walking at Biden's side as he strolls to and from Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on the White House South Lawn in an apparent effort to help mask the president's stiff gait.\n\nStill, neither party is making serious contingency plans. Whether voters want to believe it or not, the general election matchup is all but set.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said many voters are recovering from what he called \"a knock-down, drag-out fight\" that was the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Many of them have not wrapped their heads around the fact that it is, in fact, going to be a rematch,\" Cooper said in an interview. \"When they do, I don't think there's any question that Joe Biden is going to win the day.\"\n\nGetting to 270 electoral votes -- The battleground states\n\nEven before voters begin paying close attention, the political map in the fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency is already taking shape.\n\nBiden's campaign is increasingly optimistic about North Carolina, a state he lost by just 1 percentage point in 2020. Overall, the Democratic president's reelection campaign has several hundred staff in more than 133 offices in the seven most critical states: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and North Carolina.\n\nTrump's team has barely begun to roll out swing-state infrastructure, although he campaigned in Wisconsin and Michigan over the past week, sending a clear signal that he wants to block Biden's path to reelection via the Democrats' Midwestern \"blue wall.\"\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said Trump is making plans to invest new resources in at least two other Democratic-leaning states.\n\nVideo below: Will pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses impact the 2024 elections?\n\nAt a private donor retreat in Florida on Saturday, LaCivita discussed the campaign's plans to expand its electoral map into Virginia and Minnesota, based on the Trump team's growing optimism that both states are within reach.\n\n\"We have a real opportunity to expand the map here,\" LaCivita told The Associated Press. \"The Biden campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and in their 'vaunted ground game'. And they have nothing to show for it.\"\n\nBiden's campaign welcomed Trump's team to spend money in Democratic states. \"The Biden campaign is going to relentlessly focus on the pathway to 270 electoral votes, and that's what our efforts represent,\" campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nBiden has been spending far more aggressively on election infrastructure and advertising heading into the six-month stretch toward Election Day.\n\nIn the eight weeks since Trump essentially clinched the Republican nomination, his campaign has spent virtually nothing on television advertising, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Outside groups aligned with Trump have spent just over $9 million.\n\nOver the same period, AdImpact found, Biden and his allies have spent more than $29 million spread across Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump's team has been unusually conservative, in part, to avoid the perceived mistakes of 2020, when his campaign essentially ran out of money and was forced to cut back on advertising in the election's critical final days, but also because it has struggled to reignite its appeal with small donors and because of the diversion of some dollars to the former president's legal defense.\n\nTrump's team insists it will soon ramp up its advertising and on-the-ground infrastructure, although LaCivita refused to offer any specifics.\n\nVoters underwhelmed with their options\n\nIt is clear that Biden and Trump have serious work to do to improve their standing with voters.\n\nWhile optimistic in public, Biden allies privately acknowledge that his approval ratings may be lower than Democrat Jimmy Carter's numbers at this point in his presidency. Trump's ratings are not much better.\n\nPublic polling consistently shows that voters don't like their 2024 options.\n\nOnly about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be excited by Biden (21%) or Trump (25%) being elected president, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in March. Only about one-quarter of voters in the survey say they would be satisfied about each.\n\nA CNN poll conducted in April found that 53% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with the presidential candidates they have to choose from in this year's election.\n\nAnother major wild card is Kennedy, a member of the storied political dynasty and an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who is running as an independent. Both major campaigns are taking him seriously as a potential spoiler, with Trump's allies notably ramping up their criticism of Kennedy in recent days.\n\nBiden's plan: Remind voters what Trump's presidency was like\n\nFor now, Biden's team is most focused on reminding voters of Trump's divisive leadership. Three years after Trump left office, there is a sense that some voters may have forgotten what it was like with the former reality television star in the Oval Office -- or his efforts to overturn the 2020 election that have landed him in legal peril.\n\n\"The plan is reminding voters of what life was like with Trump and also demonstrating to voters that the ways in which the world feels uncertain to them now are not, in fact, caused by the president, but can actually be navigated by this president,\" Biden pollster Molly Murphy told the AP. \"Voters will trust his leadership and stewardship, knowing that things can be a lot worse if it's Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden's team is also betting that fierce backlash to new restrictions on abortion, which Trump and Republicans have largely championed, will drive voters to Democrats like it did in the 2022 midterm election and 2023 state races.\n\nVideo below: How Secretaries of State Work to Ensure Trust in Elections\n\nBut Biden's success also is dependent on the Democrat's ability to reassemble his winning coalition from 2020 at a time when enthusiasm is lagging among critical voting blocs, including Blacks, young voters and Arab Americans unhappy over the president's handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nTrump's plan: Turn his legal woes to his advantage\n\nTrump has been forced to adapt his campaign to his first criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors allege he committed financial fraud to hide hush money payments to a porn actor, Stormy Daniels, who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump. He denies her claim and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFor now, Trump is forced to attend the trial most weekdays. A verdict is likely still weeks away. And after that, he faces the prospect of more trials related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents. The Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump should be granted immunity, or partial immunity, for the actions he took while in office.\n\nTrump over the past week wedged in campaign stops around his court schedule, rallying voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, where the abortion debate is raging.\n\nTrump seemed to be searching for a way to lessen the political sting from the upheaval over the Supreme Court's overturning of national abortion rights. The former president suggested the issue will ultimately bring the country together as states carve out differing laws.\n\n\"A lot of bad things will happen beyond the abortion issue if you don't win elections, with your taxes and everything else,\" he told Michigan voters.\n\nTrump's camp privately maintains that his unprecedented trial in New York will dominate the news -- and voters' attention -- for the foreseeable future. His campaign has largely stopped trying to roll out unrelated news during the trial.\n\nEven if Trump were to be convicted by the New York jury, his advisers insist the fundamentals of the election will not change. Trump has worked aggressively to undermine public confidence in the charges against him. Meanwhile, more traditional issues work in his favor, including stubbornly high inflation and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the view of the Trump team.\n\nLaCivita said that such issues constantly reinforce Biden's weakness as \"the news of the day keeps getting worse.\"\n\nBoth sides seem to agree that the dynamics of the race may yet shift dramatically based on any number of factors, from how the economy fares or the course of the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to crime or migration trends or other foreseen events. Potential candidate debates this fall could be another wild card.\n\nSuch uncertainty, said Biden's battleground states director Dan Kanninen, can play to their favor.\n\n\"That dynamic is an opportunity as much as a challenge for us,\" he said, \"because we will have the resources, the infrastructure and the operation built to be engaging voters throughout all those difficult waters.\"", "source": {"uri": "kcra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCRA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kcra.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

The campaign did not provide further details of the fundraising haul, which will be released in filings later this month.\n\nTrump is facing a significant cash deficit in the presidential race. Through the end of April, President Joe Biden had more than twice as much money in the bank as Trump, according to campaign disclosures. Still, Trump's fundraising has increased since he became the presumptive Republican nominee in early March, and advisers have argued that he will raise enough funds to compete.\n\nThe fundraising figures were announced during a roughly one-hour presentation by Trump campaign leaders Susie Wiles, Chris LaCivita and Tony Fabrizio. Biden has yet to announce his April numbers.\n\nDuring their presentation, details of which were first reported by The New York Times, the Trump campaign officials argued that Trump is in a strong position heading into the final six months of the race. They maintained that he is solidly ahead in three states that will play a major role in determining the outcome of the election -- Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. The most competitive battlegrounds, they contended, are Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. They also said they would aim to expand the map into Minnesota and Virginia, Democratic-leaning states where they said private polling showed Trump running competitively with Biden.\n\nThe retreat, which is being held at the Four Seasons hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, comes as Trump is in the middle of his hush-money trial in New York. The case has complicated Trump's campaign plans, forcing him to be in court four days per week. The Trump aides, however, contended that Trump was still managing to maintain an aggressive schedule. The former president, they said, will in the coming weeks hold fundraisers in Kentucky, New York, Nevada, Houston and Dallas. He is also planning an upcoming rally in New Jersey and a speech in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Trump campaign also addressed a private meeting it had with a group of outside Trump-aligned organizations on Friday. The campaign is looking to collaborate with pro-Trump outfits, such as Turning Point USA, on voter canvassing efforts.

And it's the only way they're going to win, in their opinion, and it's actually killing them. But it doesn't bother me.\"\n\nBefore making the comparison, Trump baselessly insisted that the various indictments against him and his allies in several states were being orchestrated by the Biden administration.\n\nHe said that, before his indictment, he was gentler on Biden, despite the outcome of the 2020 election. \"You have to respect the office of the presidency,\" Trump said. \"And I never talk to him like this.\"\n\nTrump entered the event to the recording of the national anthem that he made with a group of people arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob seeking to disrupt the certification of Biden's Electoral College win. Trump praised the song.\n\nIn his speech, he complained repeatedly about the criminal trial in Manhattan, to which he will return Monday, insisted that Democrats use \"welfare\" to cheat in elections and said he would need an attorney general with \"courage\" as he mocked his former attorney general, William Barr, who recently endorsed Trump after having spoken critically of Trump since the administration ended.\n\nTrump also indulged in conspiracy theories around his 2020 loss, and said that his hand-picked chair of the Republican National Committee, Michael Whatley, would prevent \"cheating\" in the upcoming election.\n\nTrump's comments about welfare to wealthy donors at the event called to mind remarks caught on tape by Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential run, when he dismissed 47% of voters as off-limits because they did not pay taxes.\n\n\"When you are Democrat, you start off essentially at 40% because you have civil service, you have the unions and you have welfare,\" Trump said Saturday. \"And don't underestimate welfare. They get welfare to vote, and then they cheat on top of that -- they cheat.\"\n\nBut Trump focused more on his own legal jeopardy, as he faces four different indictments and 88 criminal charges. On Friday, he had to listen in court to his former communications adviser, Hope Hicks, testify in the trial in which he is accused of falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments made to a porn actor.\n\nHe also spent several minutes acknowledging Rod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois whose lengthy prison sentence after being convicted of corruption charges was commuted by Trump, and who was at the RNC event.\n\nThe former president said that he came to the decision to issue the pardon after seeing Blagojevich's wife on television advocating his release, and that it was sealed that he would intervene when he learned that James Comey, the former FBI director whom Trump fired amid an investigation into Trump and his campaign, was connected to the Blagojevich investigation.\n\nTrump also mocked the physical appearance of Jack Smith, the special counsel who has indicted him twice.\n\n\"He's unattractive both inside and out,\" Trump said. \"This is one unattractive dude.\" He then used two expletives to describe Smith.\n\nHe praised House Speaker Mike Johnson, who, in his own remarks, said the nation needed \"a strong man\" in the White House.\n\nAt another point, Trump said that if anyone wanted to donate $1 million to the RNC on the spot, \"I will let you come up and speak.\" He sounded disappointed until someone accepted the invitation.\n\nTrump laid blame for the slim margin in the House on the issue of abortion, after he appointed the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, for which he has repeatedly taken credit. \"We had a rough thing because of the, you know, the issue of abortion largely. I think we would have had 45 seats more,\" Trump said.\n\nThe meandering remarks drew a sharp contrast with the specifics provided by Trump's top advisers at a presentation earlier Saturday. His advisers said that Trump's campaign and the party were projected to raise $76.2 million in April, according to two people who attended the briefing.\n\nTrump's three top advisers -- Susie Wiles, Chris LaCivita and Tony Fabrizio -- briefed donors, presented a slideshow and took questions afterward, the attendees said. The attendees were not authorized to speak publicly about the event, which was a closed-door briefing and gathering for party donors.\n\nTrump's advisers presented a bullish case for the candidate that included the possibility of expanding the electoral map to include the Democratic-leaning states of Minnesota and Virginia. They also noted that Trump has remained mostly ahead in polls even while being outspent by Biden, just as the former president was outspent in the primary by his rivals.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission will not receive fundraising reports until later this month, meaning the numbers can't be verified until then. In March, Trump and his allied groups reported raising $65.6 million -- a significant amount, but still well below what Biden and his affiliated outside groups have raised.\n\nThe slideshow presentation included three different Electoral College maps, the attendees said. The first was dismissed as \"the media's version,\" which included seven swing states: Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina across the Southwest and the Sun Belt, plus Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in the industrial north.\n\nA second slide described \"the actual current reality\" as only having three swing states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nAnd a third slide described an \"expanded reality\" in which both Minnesota and Virginia would be in play for Trump -- an ambitious view of states not widely seen as among the most competitive, but in which the Trump team insists the former president has gained ground.\n\nTrump's advisers also described some of their strategy for the general election in the presentation, including reaching 2016 levels of support with white voters and expanding support among Black and Latino voters, particularly among urban men.\n\nThe campaign strategists also outlined a plan to prevent the kinds of losses that occurred in 2022 that have been linked to the issue of abortion and the backlash from the Supreme Court's overturning of federal abortion rights before the midterm elections.", "source": {"uri":

But such efforts likely will come up short, experts say.\n\nEach of the presumptive presidential nominees is taking shots at the other's competence and policy ideas, using official events and courthouse rants to go at it. And both are trying to expand the list of swing states -- though experts, history and polling suggest long odds -- as they scramble to stitch together the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win in November.\n\nBiden campaign aides have contended for weeks that the president could turn North Carolina and Florida blue, saying both are in play despite Trump's polling leads there.\n\nOn Sunday, Jason Miller, a senior Trump aide, tweeted this: \"At a private donor retreat, Trump team says Minnesota and Virginia are in play,\" referring to comments Trump reportedly made at a GOP gathering in Florida.\n\nFord O'Connell, a Florida-based Republican political strategist, said in a Monday phone interview that \"any presidential candidate will always want to be trying to expand the electoral map in any way possible.\"\n\nHe added that Trump's weekend prognostication should not be met with much surprise, \"especially since the candidate, in this case, was talking to their more well-heeled donors.\"\n\nKyle Kondik of the University of Virginia said Monday that he \"can see the appeal in trying to expand the map,\" but added: \"Although, I'll only really believe states like Florida, Minnesota, and Virginia are in play if the candidate that won each state in 2020 feels compelled to commit significant resources to defending them.\"\n\nThat means if the winner in each of those states resists the urge to take his opponent's bait, they are unlikely to become actual battlegrounds, according to Kondik. \"It's also unclear exactly how much the 2020 loser spends in those states,\" he added in an email, \"particularly in a state like Florida, you need to really spend big to hit all of the media markets.\"\n\nRepublican nominees have won Florida in four of the last six general elections, including by Trump in 2016 and 2020. North Carolina has been in the GOP column in 10 of the last 12 presidential elections.\n\nThe last Republican to take Minnesota was Richard M. Nixon in 1972, with Virginia recently going to Democrats in the last four elections after Republicans won the state in the previous 10 cycles.\n\n\"Minnesota could be in play only on an extremely good night for Trump. It's more educated than any other rust belt state,\" James Black, a Liberty University researcher wrote on X. \"On the other hand, Trump would win Maine before he flips Virginia. It's not going to happen even on a good night, as 2016 showed us.\"\n\nO'Connell agreed that Virginia is the longer shot for Trump.\n\n\"While Virginia has a Republican governor and the party is doing pretty well in the state legislature, North Virginia is more problematic,\" he said. \"As the federal government has gotten bigger and bigger, so has Democrats' advantage. If Democratic turnout there is significantly depressed, it's conceivable Trump wins the state. But, with 'uncommitted' and economic frustrations there, Minnesota is much more likely.\"\n\nTrump's team is betting that the \"uncommitted\" movement, angry with Biden over his inability -- or unwillingness -- to press Israel into lightening its military response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, could drive down Biden's final vote total enough to cause what would be a major upset.\n\n\"If Biden wins Florida or Trump wins Minnesota, it'll likely be part of a larger national victory for either of them,\" Kondik said.\n\nSome analysts have said the same about the Biden campaign targeting North Carolina, where Biden spent Thursday of last week, and Florida.\n\nAs he has during stops in other battlegrounds and potential swing states, Biden last week told supporters in Wilmington, N.C., that Trump and congressional Republicans have done little to improve their lives.\n\n\"Look, my predecessor and [his] MAGA Republican allies ... have a very different view. Every single Republican voted against the American Rescue Plan -- every one,\" Biden said as an audience member shouted \"Shame on them!\"\n\nBiden continued: \"That's providing hundreds of millions of dollars to deliver drinking water to all of North Carolina's schools. The vast majority of them voted against the infrastructure law, as well.\"\n\nTrump used campaign rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan last week, as well as recent hallway remarks outside his criminal hush money trial in New York City, to describe the incumbent president as incompetent, the leader of a corruption plot against all things Trump, and too mentally and physically frail for the job. The challenger also slammed Biden's electric vehicle push in auto industry stronghold Michigan, contending the policy would hinder the state's job market and economy.\n\nKondik assessed that \"North Carolina probably belongs in a different category because it was decided by such a small margin in 2020 -- it is one of the core battleground states.\" Trump topped Biden in the Tar Heel State in 2020, 49.9 percent to 48.6 percent.\n\nOne big reason Biden was in North Carolina's swing county of New Hanover last week: There likely would be no path back to the White House for Trump if he loses the state.\n\n\"In this iteration of the Electoral College map, North Carolina is always going to be in play. Now, Republican candidates have usually done enough to win it,\" O'Connell said. \"There's no reason to believe Trump won't win it again. If Trump loses North Carolina, he loses the election.\"\n\nWith many polls taken in the last few weeks in battlegrounds and possible battleground states within the margins of error, Biden and Trump are the political equivalents of Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone, the thoroughbred horses that finished first and second in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday.\n\nWith less than six months to go until Election Day, however, the stretch run is still many furlongs away.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_bennett@rollcall.com", "name": "John T.

It's a race that is at once deeply entrenched and highly in flux as many voters are only just beginning to embrace the reality of the 2024 campaign.\n\nWars, trials, the independent candidacy of Robert Kennedy Jr. and deep divisions across America have injected extraordinary uncertainty into a race for the White House in which either man would be the oldest president ever sworn in on Inauguration Day. At the same time, policy fights over abortion, immigration and the economy are raging on Capitol Hill and in statehouses.\n\nVoters in denial\n\nHovering over it all is the disbelief of many voters, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Biden and Trump -- their respective parties' presumptive nominees -- will ultimately appear on the general election ballot this fall.\n\n\"I think we have an electorate that's going through the stages of grief about this election,\" said Sarah Longwell, who conducts regular focus groups with voters across the political spectrum as co-founder of Republican Voters Against Trump. \"They've done denial -- 'Not these two, can't possibly be these two.' And I think they're in depression now. I'm waiting for people to hit acceptance.\"\n\nTrump is in the midst of the first of potentially four criminal trials and facing felony charges. The Constitution does not prevent him from assuming the presidency if convicted -- or even if he is in prison.\n\nBiden, who will turn 82 years old just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77.\n\nPrivately, Democratic operatives close to the campaign worry constantly about Biden's health and voters' dim perceptions of it. In recent weeks, aides have begun walking at Biden's side as he strolls to and from Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on the White House South Lawn in an apparent effort to help mask the president's stiff gait.\n\nStill, neither party is making serious contingency plans. Whether voters want to believe it or not, the general election matchup is all but set.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said many voters arel recovering from what he called \"a knock-down, drag-out fight\" that was the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Many of them have not wrapped their heads around the fact that it is, in fact, going to be a rematch,\" Cooper said in an interview. \"When they do, I don't think there's any question that Joe Biden is going to win the day.\"\n\nGetting to 270 electorial votes -- the battleground states\n\nEven before voters begin paying close attention, the political map in the fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency is already taking shape.\n\nBiden's campaign is increasingly optimistic about North Carolina, a state he lost by just 1 percentage point in 2020. Overall, the Democratic president's reelection campaign has several hundred staff in more than 133 offices in the seven most critical states: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.\n\nTrump's team has barely begun to roll out swing-state infrastructure, although he campaigned in Wisconsin and Michigan over the past week, sending a clear signal that he wants to block Biden's path to reelection via the Democrats' Midwestern \"blue wall.\"\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said Trump is making plans to invest new resources in at least two other Democratic-leaning states.\n\nAt a private donor retreat in Florida on Saturday, LaCivita discussed the campaign's plans to expand its electoral map into Virginia and Minnesota, based on the Trump team's growing optimism that both states are within reach.\n\n\"We have a real opportunity to expand the map here,\" LaCivita told The Associated Press. \"The Biden campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and in their 'vaunted ground game'. And they have nothing to show for it.\"\n\nBiden's campaign welcomed Trump's team to spend money in Democratic states. \"The Biden campaign is going to relentlessly focus on the pathway to 270 electoral votes, and that's what our efforts represent,\" campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nBiden has been spending far more aggressively on election infrastructure and advertising heading into the six-month stretch toward Election Day.\n\nIn the eight weeks since he essentially clinched the Republican nomination, Trump's campaign has spent virtually nothing on television advertising, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Outside groups aligned with Trump have spent just over $9 million.\n\nOver the same period, AdImpact found, Biden and his allies have spent more than $29 million spread across Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump's team has been unusually conservative, in part, to avoid the perceived mistakes of 2020, when his campaign essentially ran out of money and was forced to cut back on advertising in the election's critical final days, but also because it has struggled to reignite its appeal with small donors and because of the diversion of some dollars to the former president's legal defense.\n\nTrump's team insists they will soon ramp up their advertising and on-the-ground infrastructure, although LaCivita refused to offer any specifics.\n\nVoters underwhelmed with their options\n\nIt is clear that Biden and Trump have serious work to do to improve their standing with voters.\n\nWhile optimistic in public, Biden allies privately acknowledge that his approval ratings may be lower than Democrat Jimmy Carter's numbers at this point in his presidency. Trump's ratings are not much better.\n\nPublic polling consistently shows that voters don't like their 2024 options.\n\nOnly about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be excited by Biden (21%) or Trump (25%) being elected president, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in March. Only about one-quarter of voters in the survey say they would be satisfied about each.\n\nA recent CNN poll conducted in April found that 53% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with the presidential candidates they have to choose from in this year's election.\n\nAnother major wild card is Kennedy, a member of the storied political dynasty and an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who is running as an independent. Both major campaigns are taking him seriously as a potential spoiler, with Trump's allies notably ramping up their criticism of Kennedy in recent days.\n\nBiden's plan: Remind voters what Trump's presidency was like\n\nFor now, Biden's team is most focused on reminding voters of Trump's divisive leadership. Three years after Trump left office, there is a sense that some voters may have forgotten what it was like with the former reality television star in the Oval Office -- or his efforts to overturn the 2020 election that have landed him in legal peril.\n\n\"The plan is reminding voters of what life was like with Trump and also demonstrating to voters that the ways in which the world feels uncertain to them now are not, in fact, caused by the president, but can actually be navigated by this president,\" Biden pollster Mary Murphy told the AP. \"Voters will trust his leadership and stewardship, knowing that things can be a lot worse if it's Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden's team is also betting that fierce backlash to new restrictions on abortion, which Trump and Republicans have largely championed, will drive voters to Democrats like they did in the 2022 midterm election and 2023 state races.\n\nBut Biden's success also is dependent on the Democrat's ability to reassemble his winning coalition from 2020 at a time when enthusiasm is lagging among critical voting blocs including Blacks, young voters and Arab Americans unhappy over the president's handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nTrump's plan: Turn his legal woes to his advantage\n\nTrump has been forced to adapt his campaign to his first criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors allege he committed financial fraud to hide hush money payments to a porn actor, Stormy Daniels, who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump. He denies her claim and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFor now, Trump is forced to attend the trial most weekdays. A verdict is likely still weeks away. And after that, he faces the prospect of more trials related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents. The Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump should be granted immunity, or partial immunity, for the actions he took while in office.\n\nTrump over the past week wedged in campaign stops around his court schedule, rallying voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, where the abortion debate is raging.\n\nTrump seemed to be searching for a way to lessen the political sting from the upheaval over the Supreme Court's overturning of national abortion rights. The former president suggested the issue will ultimately bring the country together as states carve out differing laws.\n\n\"A lot of bad things will happen beyond the abortion issue if you don't win elections, with your taxes and everything else,\" he told Michigan voters.\n\nTrump's camp privately maintains that his unprecedented trial in New York will dominate the news -- and voters' attention -- for the foreseeable future. His campaign has largely stopped trying to roll out unrelated news during the trial.\n\nEven if Trump were to be convicted by the New York jury, his advisers insist the fundamentals of the election will not change. Trump has worked aggressively to undermine public confidence in the charges against him. Meanwhile, more traditional issues work in his favor, including stubbornly high inflation and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the view of the Trump team.\n\nLaCivita said that such issues constantly reinforce Biden's weakness as \"the news of the day keeps getting worse.\"\n\nBoth sides seem to agree that the dynamics of the race may yet shift dramatically based on any number of factors, from how the economy fares or the course of the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to crime or migration trends or other foreseen events. Potential candidate debates this fall could be another wild card.\n\nSuch uncertainty, said Biden's battleground states director Dan Kanninen, can play to their favor.\n\n\"That dynamic is an opportunity as much as a challenge for us,\" he said, \"because we will have the resources, the infrastructure and the operation built to be engaging voters throughout all those difficult waters.\"", "source": {"uri": "s24526.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Leader"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Accountability_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Accountability Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Longwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Longwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

They may not find this choice easy.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 38 percent of Americans think the country needs a leader willing to break some rules if that's what it takes to make things right. This significant minority included 48% Republicans.\n\nWhen the Times reporter asked Trump whether his rhetoric about ignoring the Constitution and ruling as a \"dictator for a day\" might alienate voters, the former president disagreed.\n\nRead more: Column: Biden says America is 'coming back'.

In last month's Pennsylvania primary, the former South Carolina governor, without campaigning, still won more than 16 percent of Republican votes.\n\nModerate Republicans continue looking to Haley because they have no place in the party of Trump.\n\nHaley and other non-Trump Republicans need President Biden to win to open the door to reforming the Republican Party into a party that welcomes traditional conservatives.\n\nHaley knows that Trump, as a leader, is a loser. That is to say, he led the party to losses in 2018 and 2020, and to a disappointing finish in 2022.\n\nShe has called Trump \"unhinged,\" \"toxic,\" and lacking in \"moral clarity.\" She has said that he is responsible for Congressional Republicans refusing to support a border security bill that included most of their demands.\n\n\"How much more chaos are Republicans willing to put up with?\" she asked during the campaign. Trump, she said, has \"broken\" so much in American life, \"but he doesn't know how to fix things.\"\n\nBut fearing the blind loyalty that Trump enjoys from most Republicans, she has not endorsed Biden. On the contrary, pressure is growing for her to get in line and endorse Trump.\n\nLast week, another former Trump critic, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) met with Trump in Miami. Trump declared that he \"greatly appreciated\" DeSantis' support.\n\nThis is a man whom Trump smeared viciously. He suggested that DeSantis was guilty of \"grooming high school girls\" with alcohol when the governor worked as a teacher. He labeled him \"Ron DeSanctimonious.\"\n\nDeSantis is just another name in a line of groveling Republicans seeking to become Trump acolytes. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu famously called Trump \"f -- ing crazy.\" But last month he announced he is now supporting Trump.\n\nTrump's Attorney General Bill Barr, who resigned in December 2020 amid Trump's false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen, and who last year called him \"unfit for office,\" now says that he too will vote for Trump.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), having been famously demeaned by Trump as \"Little Marco\" and falsely accused by Trump surrogates of having a secret gay lifestyle, now endorses Trump.\n\nSen. J. D. Vance (R-Ohio) is on the record calling Trump an \"idiot\" and a \"loathsome\" man. On \"Fox News Sunday,\" host Shannon Bream recently asked him \"what's changed with you that...you are [now] supporting him?\"\n\nVance, looking quite timid, said that his perspective changed when, instead of considering Trump's \"degradation\" of politics, he instead looked at the \"reality...that Donald Trump was a success.\"\n\nVance has sheep-like company in Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). As Senate minority leader, McConnell said that Trump was \"practically and morally responsible\" for the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump launched a racist attack on McConnell's Taiwanese American wife, Elaine Chao deriding her just last year as McConnell's \"China-loving wife, Coco Chow!\"\n\nBut McConnell now says he will vote for Trump anyway.\n\nAnd don't forget Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), whose wife Trump insulted and whose father Trump baselessly accused of being involved in JFK's assassination. At the time, Cruz called Trump a \"sniveling coward.\" But he went on to become one of Trump's strongest supporters in Congress and is now endorsing him.\n\nWhat does it say that so many prominent conservative politicians have been willing to debase and humiliate themselves in service of Trump?\n\nAnd what will Haley do?\n\nTrump insulted her at a rally earlier this year by asking: \"Where's her husband? Oh, he's away.\" Haley's husband was deployed with South Carolina National Guard.\n\nHaley called the dig \"disgusting.\"\n\nShe has some company in not yet endorsing Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence (R) has not endorsed him. Pence said that he \"cannot in good conscience\" vote for Trump.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said that he would not vote for Trump \"under any circumstances.\"\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has not endorsed him, either.\n\nHutchinson, referring to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, wrote that Trump \"continues to undermine our democracy by defending the actions of that dark day.\"\n\nPresident George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have not endorsed Trump. But Haley and other GOP leaders who have not endorsed Trump somehow refuse to take the logical step of endorsing President Biden.\n\nHalf-measures are not good enough in an election where one of the candidates said he would \"terminate...the Constitution.\"\n\nThe last time Trump was on the ballot, plenty of Republicans stood for principles, putting country before party by supporting Biden. History will remember their names kindly: John Kasich, Susan Molinari, Charlie Dent, Christine Todd Wittman, David Jolly, Michael Steele, Tom Coleman.\n\nThis year, Haley can set herself up for the 2028 presidential race by separating herself from the Trump-mania washing over her party.\n\nIf Haley endorses Trump, the corruption of the GOP will be complete.\n\nBut if Haley endorses Biden, she will put country before party and earn the respect of mainstream Republicans, her countrymen and a place in history.\n\nAmbassador Haley, do the right thing.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_williams@thehill.com", "name": "Juan Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Barr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sununu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sununu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Bream", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Bream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The campaign did not provide further details of the fundraising haul, which will be released in filings later this month.\n\nTrump is facing a significant cash deficit in the presidential race.

Trump 2024 Election Polls: Trump Loses Support In Key Biden Demographics", "body": "Former President Donald Trump's early polling lead over President Joe Biden has slipped in recent months as he's been on trial in two separate cases in Manhattan, with the latest survey showing Biden gaining support among key demographics.\n\nIn a race this close, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s candidacy has the potential to sway the election -- though it's unclear in whose favor. Earlier surveys suggested Kennedy Jr., a scion of the country's most famous Democratic family, could draw more votes from Biden, but more recent polling suggests he'd hurt Trump. Since Kennedy Jr. is running as an independent without the backing of one of the major political parties, he is required to petition in each state for ballot access. His campaign has said he has qualified to appear on the ballots in Michigan, California and Utah, and that he has enough signatures to appear on the ballots in Nevada, Idaho, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Iowa and North Carolina.\n\nOther polls have suggested Biden -- and the Democratic party as a whole -- have been losing support among key demographics, including Black, Latino and younger voters. A Harvard Youth poll released last month found Biden leads Trump by eight percentage points among people ages 18 to 29, compared to a 23-point margin at this point in the lead-up to the 2020 election. An April Axios/Ipsos poll shows Biden has only a nine-point advantage with Latino voters, compared to 29 points after his first year in office. And a recent Wall Street Journal survey found more Black voters said they were leaning toward Trump than they did in 2020, including 30% of Black men (12% of Black men voted for Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast), and 11% of Black women (6% of Black women voted for Trump in 2020).\n\nBiden and Trump are poised for a historic rematch after clinching their respective parties' nominations. Polls show historically low voter enthusiasm as both candidates have relatively low favorability ratings below 45%. The NBC poll found 64% voters said they were \"very interested\" in this year's election, a 20-year low. Trump has centered his campaign around his legal woes, accusing prosecutors and judges in the cases of working at Biden's behest to hurt his chances of winning the election, though there's no evidence suggesting the notion is true. Biden, meanwhile, has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, citing his role in the January 6 Capitol riots, and has hammered Trump over his appointment of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Immigration has also taken center stage in the election as border crossings have reached an all-time high under Biden and Congress has failed to reach an agreement on new border controls.\n\nThese Are The Six Swing States Trump Needs To Take From Biden To Win In November (Forbes)\n\nRFK Jr. Candidacy Hurts Trump More Than Biden, Poll Reports (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The new survey provides a road map of the persuadables most open to appeals in a campaign being shaped by sharp divides on abortion and immigration as well as an unprecedented criminal trial of a former president, now underway in New York.\n\nWhat's more, 8% are now supporting independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and an additional 5% backing other third-party contenders. Most of their supporters acknowledge they might switch their allegiances before they cast a ballot.\n\nTiffany Batton, 43, an independent from Chicago who was among those surveyed, plans to vote for Biden. \"He inherited a lot of problems from the last administration,\" the social worker said in a follow-up phone interview. \"I feel like, if given a chance, he could fulfill some of those campaign promises if he had another four years.\"\n\nBut she might change her mind, depending on what happens in the Mideast and elsewhere. \"The war in Israel has been weighing really heavy on me,\" she said.\n\nBrett Watchom, 36, a shipping clerk from Denver who is also an independent, backs Kennedy, attracted by his position on housing and because he is \"the only one not part of the horrible uni-party machine.\"\n\nHe allowed that he might switch his support \"if the Libertarian candidate turns out to be better.\"\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe candidates have limited time ahead to make their case.\n\n\"When we think about the race tied with just 26 weeks to go, we have to consider that people tune out politics and the party conventions in July and August,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"That leaves just 17 weeks for candidates to actively campaign, and it's actually 13 or 14 weeks when you consider states where early voting starts weeks before Election Day.\n\n\"We're basically at the doorstep of the election, and the outcome is a coin flip.\"\n\nBiden gains among Black voters, Trump loses among young voters\n\nThe new poll shows Biden's standing against Trump improving inch-by-inch, albeit within the survey's margin of error.\n\nIn the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll taken in January, Biden trailed Trump by 3 points - 34%-37% - and in March he trailed by 2, at 38%-40%. Now they're even.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, Biden has gained ground among some key voters while Trump has lost it.\n\nThe White House has recently announced policy decisions and aired political ads that have particular appeal to some younger swing voters, including moving to ease federal regulation of marijuana and relieve some college student debt. This month, Biden is slated to deliver the commencement address at Morehouse College, an historically Black school.\n\nWho's in play? Young voters, Hispanic voters, independents and RFK backers\n\nThe strength of the third-party candidates may be built on sand.\n\nEight in 10 of those supporting Kennedy say they might change their minds before they vote. So do 88% of those supporting independent Cornel West, 65% of those who plan to support the Libertarian nominee, and 58% backing Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nTypically the support for third-party candidates declines as Election Day nears, although in close elections the impact of drawing only thousands of voters in swing states can tip the election outcome.\n\nIn 2016, the Green Party candidate took votes from Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, crucial states she ended up losing. In 2020, the Libertarian candidate drew voters from Trump in Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, critical states he lost.\n\n\"I'm leaning towards Joe Biden, and I'll tell you why: I look at his record on the economy,\" said Al Wilson, 56, an independent from Shelby, Michigan, who works as the production manager for an auto manufacturer. He credits the president with restoring the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also cites Biden's presidential \"deportment,\" implicitly contrasting it with Trump. \"We need leadership that is not (in) the news cycle all the time,\" he said. \"I get sick of that. I don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear controversy. I don't want you involved in controversy all the time.\"\n\nOther swing voters also say they might change their minds before November, including 43% of independents. Nearly half of independent women, 47%, are open to persuasion, one reason the Biden campaign has focused so intently on abortion access as an issue.\n\nSome groups that Democrats rely on in national elections say their minds aren't firmly made up. That includes 37% of Hispanic voters, 27% of Black voters and 44% of voters under 35.\n\nMore than two-thirds of those surveyed (69%) say the country is \"on the wrong track;\" fewer than 1 in 4 (23%) say it is \"headed in the right direction.\" That's a tick less positive than the nation's mood in the March survey.\n\n\"I haven't made up my mind yet,\" said Emily Weller, 39, a Republican from Indianapolis. \"I would not vote for former President Trump; I don't think that I would vote for President Biden,\" the stay-at-home mom said. \"My vote matters to me and I want to vote, but it's not cut-and-dried.\"\n\n'Everything was better under Trump'\n\nThen there are those voters definitely not in play.\n\nThose now supporting Biden say by 84%-14% that their minds are firmly made up. Trump supporters are set by a similarly wide 83%-16%.\n\n\"Everything was better under Trump,\" declared Mike McCombs, 67, a Republican and an independent insurance agent from Lincolnton, Georgia. \"The economy was better. Fuel prices were better. Biden has choked the middle class to death.\"\n\nA conviction of Trump in his current trial, on charges relating to paying hush money to a porn star, wouldn't change his view. \"It would probably make me support him more because this is a rigged trial anyway,\" he said.\n\nBoth major-party candidates have solidified their standing among their partisans. Now 87% of Democrats back Biden, up 7 points since January; 84% of Republicans back Trump, up 5 points.\n\nA negligible 2% of Democrats and 1% of Republicans are crossing the aisle to support the other major party's presumptive nominee.\n\n\"I liked the way he ran the country when he was president the first time,\" said Stephen Harrison, 52, a small-business owner and Trump supporter from Manhattan, Montana. \"The economy is No. 1. He did a good job of keeping things running and open best he could during the pandemic.\n\n\"The only thing that would change my mind is if he isn't on the ballot,\" he said.\n\nFrancis Spitale, 60, a Democrat from Charleston, South Carolina, who cares for newborns, says her support for Biden is unshakable.\n\n\"Are all the policies perfect?\" she asked. \"No. But I respect him as a good, decent human being who has been able to accomplish more in two or three years than a lot of other presidents have been able to.\"\n\nShe dismissed those who say Biden, at 81, is too old to serve another term.\n\n\"No one's saying the (Rolling) Stones are too old to have a concert; Bruce Springsteen is out there at 73,\" she said. \"If you are a productive person, you don't have to be skateboarding and skiing down the slopes to be effective.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Libertarian Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commission on Presidential Debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

It's a race that is at once deeply entrenched and highly in flux as many voters are only just beginning to embrace the reality of the 2024 campaign.\n\nWars, trials, the independent candidacy of Robert Kennedy Jr. and deep divisions across America have injected extraordinary uncertainty into a race for the White House in which either man would be the oldest president ever sworn in on Inauguration Day. At the same time, policy fights over abortion, immigration and the economy are raging on Capitol Hill and in statehouses.\n\nVOTERS IN DENIAL\n\nHovering over it all is the disbelief of many voters, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Biden and Trump -- their respective parties' presumptive nominees -- will ultimately appear on the general election ballot this fall.\n\n\"I think we have an electorate that's going through the stages of grief about this election,\" said Sarah Longwell, who conducts regular focus groups with voters across the political spectrum as co-founder of Republican Voters Against Trump. \"They've done denial -- Not these two, can't possibly be these two.' And I think they're in depression now. I'm waiting for people to hit acceptance.\"\n\nTrump is in the midst of the first of potentially four criminal trials and facing felony charges. The Constitution does not prevent him from assuming the presidency if convicted -- or even if he is in prison.\n\nBiden, who will turn 82 years old just weeks after Election Day, November 5, is already the oldest president in US history; Trump is 77.\n\nPrivately, Democratic operatives close to the campaign worry constantly about Biden's health and voters' dim perceptions of it. In recent weeks, aides have begun walking at Biden's side as he strolls to and from Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on the White House South Lawn in an apparent effort to help mask the president's stiff gait.\n\nStill, neither party is making serious contingency plans. Whether voters want to believe it or not, the general election matchup is all but set.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said many voters are recovering from what he called \"a knock-down, drag-out fight\" that was the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Many of them have not wrapped their heads around the fact that it is, in fact, going to be a rematch,\" Cooper said in an interview. \"When they do, I don't think there's any question that Joe Biden is going to win the day.\"\n\nGETTING TO 270 ELECTORIAL VOTES -- THE BATTLEGROUND STATES\n\nEven before voters begin paying close attention, the political map in the fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency is already taking shape.\n\nBiden's campaign is increasingly optimistic about North Carolina, a state he lost by just 1 percentage point in 2020. Overall, the Democratic president's reelection campaign has several hundred staff in more than 133 offices in the seven most critical states: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.\n\nTrump's team has barely begun to roll out swing-state infrastructure, although he campaigned in Wisconsin and Michigan over the past week, sending a clear signal that he wants to block Biden's path to reelection via the Democrats' Midwestern \"blue wall.\"\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said Trump is making plans to invest new resources in at least two other Democratic-leaning states.\n\nAt a private donor retreat in Florida on Saturday, LaCivita discussed the campaign's plans to expand its electoral map into Virginia and Minnesota, based on the Trump team's growing optimism that both states are within reach.\n\n\"We have a real opportunity to expand the map here,\" LaCivita told tThe Associated Press. \"The Biden campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and in their vaunted ground game'. And they have nothing to show for it.\"\n\nBiden's campaign welcomed Trump's team to spend money in Democratic states. \"The Biden campaign is going to relentlessly focus on the pathway to 270 electoral votes, and that's what our efforts represent,\" campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nBiden has been spending far more aggressively on election infrastructure and advertising heading into the six-month stretch toward Election Day.\n\nIn the eight weeks since he essentially clinched the Republican nomination, Trump's campaign has spent virtually nothing on television advertising, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Outside groups aligned with Trump have spent just over $9 million.\n\nOver the same period, AdImpact found, Biden and his allies have spent more than $29 million spread across Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump's team has been unusually conservative, in part, to avoid the perceived mistakes of 2020, when his campaign essentially ran out of money and was forced to cut back on advertising in the election's critical final days, but also because it has struggled to reignite its appeal with small donors and because of the diversion of some dollars to the former president's legal defense.\n\nTrump's team insists they will soon ramp up their advertising and on-the-ground infrastructure, although LaCivita refused to offer any specifics.\n\nVOTERS UNDERWHELMED WITH THEIR OPTIONS\n\nIt is clear that Biden and Trump have serious work to do to improve their standing with voters.\n\nWhile optimistic in public, Biden allies privately acknowledge that his approval ratings may be lower than Democrat Jimmy Carter's numbers at this point in his presidency. Trump's ratings are not much better.\n\nPublic polling consistently shows that voters don't like their 2024 options.\n\nOnly about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be excited by Biden (21%) or Trump (25%) being elected president, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in March. Only about one-quarter of voters in the survey say they would be satisfied about each.\n\nA recent CNN poll conducted in April found that 53% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with the presidential candidates they have to choose from in this year's election.\n\nAnother major wild card is Kennedy, a member of the storied political dynasty and an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who is running as an independent. Both major campaigns are taking him seriously as a potential spoiler, with Trump's allies notably ramping up their criticism of Kennedy in recent days.\n\nBIDEN'S PLAN; REMIND VOTERS WHAT TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY WAS LIKE\n\nFor now, Biden's team is most focused on reminding voters of Trump's divisive leadership. Three years after Trump left office, there is a sense that some voters may have forgotten what it was like with the former reality television star in the Oval Office -- or his efforts to overturn the 2020 election that have landed him in legal peril.\n\n\"The plan is reminding voters of what life was like with Trump and also demonstrating to voters that the ways in which the world feels uncertain to them now are not, in fact, caused by the president, but can actually be navigated by this president,\" Biden pollster Mary Murphy told the AP. \"Voters will trust his leadership and stewardship, knowing that things can be a lot worse if it's Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden's team is also betting that fierce backlash to new restrictions on abortion, which Trump and Republicans have largely championed, will drive voters to Democrats like they did in the 2022 midterm election and 2023 state races.\n\nBut Biden's success also is dependent on the Democrat's ability to reassemble his winning coalition from 2020 at a time when enthusiasm is lagging among critical voting blocs including Blacks, young voters and Arab Americans unhappy over the president's handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nTRUMP'S PLAN: TURN HIS LEGAL WOES TO HIS ADVANTAGE\n\nTrump has been forced to adapt his campaign to his first criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors allege he committed financial fraud to hide hush money payments to a porn actor, Stormy Daniels, who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump. He denies her claim and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFor now, Trump is forced to attend the trial most weekdays. A verdict is likely still weeks away. And after that, he faces the prospect of more trials related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents. The Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump should be granted immunity, or partial immunity, for the actions he took while in office.\n\nTrump over the past week wedged in campaign stops around his court schedule, rallying voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, where the abortion debate is raging.\n\nTrump seemed to be searching for a way to lessen the political sting from the upheaval over the Supreme Court's overturning of national abortion rights. The former president suggested the issue will ultimately bring the country together as states carve out differing laws.\n\n\"A lot of bad things will happen beyond the abortion issue if you don't win elections, with your taxes and everything else,\" he told Michigan voters.\n\nTrump's camp privately maintains that his unprecedented trial in New York will dominate the news -- and voters' attention -- for the foreseeable future. His campaign has largely stopped trying to roll out unrelated news during the trial.\n\nEven if Trump were to be convicted by the New York jury, his advisers insist the fundamentals of the election will not change. Trump has worked aggressively to undermine public confidence in the charges against him. Meanwhile, more traditional issues work in his favor, including stubbornly high inflation and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, in the view of the Trump team.\n\nLaCivita said that such issues constantly reinforce Biden's weakness as \"the news of the day keeps getting worse.\"\n\nBoth sides seem to agree that the dynamics of the race may yet shift dramatically based on any number of factors, from how the economy fares or the course of the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to crime or migration trends or other foreseen events. Potential candidate debates this fall could be another wild card.\n\nSuch uncertainty, said Biden's battleground states director Dan Kanninen, can play to their favor.\n\n\"That dynamic is an opportunity as much as a challenge for us,\" he said, \"because we will have the resources, the infrastructure and the operation built to be engaging voters throughout all those difficult waters.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Accountability_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Accountability Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Longwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Longwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

He says the alleged affair never happened.\n\nBut polls show the charges carry some electoral risk: A poll conducted by ABC News and Ipsos in April 2023 found that 52% of Americans viewed the New York charges against Trump as significant.\n\nAnd a new ABC News/Ipsos poll found that a fifth of Trump's supporters said they would either reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%) if he's convicted of a felony.\n\nAt the same time, with the weekslong trial still ongoing, the details don't appear to be changing many minds, according to recent interviews with seven voters who were polled by ABC and Ipsos last year, both those who felt Trump's charges were at least somewhat serious and those who didn't.\n\nThe voter interviews suggested that their strong opinions of the former president are coloring how they are reacting to the twists and turns of the hush money trial -- rather than the other way around.\n\n\"Yes,\" Charles Carabelli, a Michigan retiree who identifies as an independent and said last year the charges were very serious, told ABC News when asked if he was keeping up with the trial. \"And I hope he [Trump] gets convicted.\"\n\nWhen pressed on what makes him think the case is serious, rather than pointing to specific details, Carabelli tied his views to his opinion of Trump more broadly: \"Because he's a shyster and a liar.

He's all about himself.\"\n\nJames Mitchell, a retired lawyer and Republican from Wyoming, indicated he didn't feel the trial would ultimately matter.\n\n\"Am I really keeping up on it? Not really because, yes, it's serious, [but] I think the system's rigged,\" said Mitchell, who last year called the charges somewhat serious.\n\nInterviews with Trump's defenders showed a similar trend.\n\nRay Flores, a 77-year-old Marine Corps veteran and Republican who lives in Dyer, Indiana, said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 and has been keeping up with the trial as well but believes it is a \"sham,\" echoing claims of persecution from Trump himself, which prosecutors deny. Flores said in last year's poll that he felt the hush money charges were not serious.\n\n\"It's all political what they're doing to Trump,\" he said in an interview. \"Everything was good four years ago. I have no complaints from then.\"\n\nOne of the voters who said last year that the case was very serious expressed openness to coming around to Trump -- entirely separate from the details of the case.\n\nFelicia Anderson, a home health nurse from Fullerton, California, said in an interview that she's leaning toward voting for President Biden in November. But a change in tone from Trump could sway her.\n\n\"To me, he talks down to people. If he would learn not to talk down to people, oh, he has me,\" Anderson, who said she identifies as a Democratic-leaning independent, told ABC News.\n\nSome outside political experts predicted that any political fallout from the trial may be blunted unless Trump ends up behind bars -- an unlikely scenario for a first-time offender in a case such as the one in New York.\n\n\"I think they're probably following it less closely, and it's just kind of background noise right now,\" GOP pollster Robert Blizzard said of voters. \"Now, if something happens, he gets thrown in jail or there's some huge thing that comes out that nobody knows about yet, that has the potential to maybe shift some attitudes.\"\n\n\"But Trump's gonna get what Trump's gonna get,\" Blizzard said, referencing the former president's likely share of the electorate.\n\nExperts note that Trump, a brash-talking and often controversial real estate mogul and former reality TV star with universal name recognition and a well-established public persona, has seen his political career survive a series of scandals, none of which have upended his standing with the Republican base. Early polls this year show him in a close race with Biden.\n\n\"The attitudes toward everything revolving around Trump's legal issues coincides directly with your preconceived attitudes toward Trump,\" Blizzard, the pollster, said.\n\nThat's not to say the trial hasn't been newsy, including fights over Trump's conduct regarding a gag order, headline-making details about how a tabloid publisher said he worked to quash unflattering stories for Trump and emotional testimony from a former aide.\n\nTrump faces other notable legal problems, including three other pending trials -- over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office and his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss. He has pleaded not guilty in all cases.\n\nBut even if any of those cases are heard ahead of the election -- a big if -- the political fallout could remain the same without a conviction or acquittal before voting ends, Blizzard said.\n\n\"When we do an open-ended question on a survey or when you're doing qualitative focus groups or things like that, nobody is bringing up Trump trials organically,\" he told ABC News. \"It's just not in the bloodstream and not something that people are paying attention to on a day-to-day basis as much as the media thinks.\"", "source": {"uri":

And power is the operative word here, because it's what they plan to wield relentlessly against their enemies as they reshape the presidency.\n\nUp to now, a lot of the focus has been on the work of Trump acolytes. The far-right Heritage Foundation has formulated \"Project 25,\" a blueprint for stacking the government with Trump loyalists who will carry out his will to \"deconstruct the adminstrative state.\"\n\nOtherwise known as the constitutional government.\n\nJoin our newsletter for thought-provoking commentary that goes beyond the surface of LGBTQ+ issues\n\nNow, Trump has given an interview that underscores just how serious this threat is. Talking to TIME magazine, Trump happily described a dystopian world where he will do whatever he wants, without any concern of consequences or fear of backlash.\n\nTrump learned one thing from his first term. He made a mistake in letting his own Cabinet members restrain him. \"When I first got to Washington, I knew very few people,\" he says. \"I had to rely on people.\" He won't make that mistake again.\n\nFirst and foremost, Trump will become the law. He will make the Justice Department report directly to him, making it a political weapon for retribution. He will appoint a special prosecutor to go after President Joe Biden, assuming the Supreme Court says presidents don't have total immunity, as Trump has asked the Court to do.\n\n\"If they said that a president doesn't get immunity, then Biden, I am sure, will be prosecuted for all of his crimes,\" Trump said. There are no crimes, of course. He also hinted that he would go after Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney currently prosecuting Trump in court, and Fani Willis, who has charged Trump with election fraud in Georgia.\n\nTrump will also pardon all the people found guilty in the January 6 insurrection. \"I call them the J-6 patriots,\" he says. If any U.S. attorney balks at Trump's politicization of the department, he would fire them.\n\nTrump also said he would use the military to round up the estimated 11 million people who are in the U.S. without documentation. When the reporter noted that the military is prohibited from acting against civilians, Trump responded, \"Well, these aren't civilians.\"\n\nHe doesn't seem to view people who live in cities as civilians, either. Trump insists big cities - that is, where people who will vote against him live - are riddled with crime, despite statistics showing crime falling. (He says that numbers are \"a lie.\") He would send the National Guard in to address crime, even if the governors don't want them there.\n\nAs for LGBTQ+ issues, it's obvious Trump will be gunning for them as well. He promised to rescind Biden's diversity and racial equity executive orders. You can count as a certainty that any pro-LGBTQ+ executive orders - like those that use the Supreme Court's reasoning that anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination is a form of sex-based discrimination - will fall as well.\n\nMeanwhile, just as he outsourced the Supreme Court nominees to the Federalist Society, Trump seems perfectly happy to have turned the planning for the logistics of his second term over to the Project 25 team. That group has promised to reject \"gender ideology,\" \"uphold bodily integrity rooted in biological realities,\" and turn the Justice Department into the law firm representing right-wing Christians in challenges against LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nProject 25 would also classify \"gender ideology\" as pornography and would arrest and imprison anyone who distributes it, with its new ban on pornography. Those who advocate for trans rights could be branded as sex offenders.\n\nThere's not much reason to think that the courts or public opinion will restrain Trump. For one thing, Trump does have the Supreme Court on his side. For another, given how radical his vision is, it would be entirely in character for Trump to simply ignore a court ruling. When the Supreme Court ruled last January that the state of Texas had to remove razor wire from the border, multiple Republicans counseled the state to simply ignore the ruling. After all, how could the Court enforce it?\n\nAs for public opinion, the outcry against the Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade is the perfect example. Trump only cares insofar that it threatens his election chances. Once he's in office, he will sign a federal abortion ban if the people who put him in office bring it to him. He's a transactional politician.\n\nCongress will also be filled with more compliant Republicans this time around as well. \"He's going to have the backup in Congress that he didn't have before,\" Rep. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican whom Trump has endorsed for an open Senate seat, told Time.\n\nThere's plenty more to fear. Trump will embolden Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and slap an economy-killing tariff on imported goods. He will go after journalists and politicians who have had the temerity to criticize him. No wonder people in D.C. are not-so-jokingly considering where they will move if Trump is re-elected.\n\nTrump's supporters characterize such fears as Trump Derangement Syndrome. \"They really think it's going to be the end of democracy as we know it, and I think it's misplaced,\" David Urban, a Trump ally, told the New York Times. \"There are plenty of grown-ups, plenty of serious people who will want to roll in a second Trump administration.\"\n\nBut that's not true. The grown-ups who were there in the first administration have said that Trump is unfit for office. Instead, Trump has surrounded himself with true believers who are serious only about unleashing the worst of Trump on the nation.\n\nIf someone tells you who they are and what they will do, you have to believe them. Trump just did that, at length. As Kellyanne Conway told Time, \"I don't think it's a big mystery what his agenda would be. But I think people will be surprised at the alacrity with which he will take action.\"", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LGBTQ Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

From the future of reproductive rights to the chances of meaningful action on climate change, from the strength of US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and Israel in its war with Hamas, to the fate of US democracy itself, existential issues are firmly to the fore.\n\nRelated: Revealed: 'extremist' Trump economist plots rightwing overhaul of US treasury\n\n\"It's the economy, stupid.\" So said the Democratic strategist James Carville, in 1992, as an adviser to Bill Clinton. Most Americans thought stewardship of the economy should change: Clinton beat George HW Bush.\n\nUnder Biden, the post-Covid recovery remains on track. Unemployment is low, stocks at all-time highs. That should bode well but the key question is whether Americans think Biden's economy is strong, or think it is working for them, or think Trump was a safer pair of hands, forgetting the chaos of Covid. According to polling, many do prefer Trump. Cost-of-living concerns dominate. Inflation remains a worry. For Biden, Republican threats to social security and Medicare might offset such worries. For Trump, whose base skews older, such threats must be downplayed - though they are present in Republicans' own transition planning.\n\nImmigration\n\nHouse Republicans impeached Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's secretary of homeland security. The Senate quashed that but at Trump's direction, Republicans sank a bipartisan border and immigration deal. One day in February, Biden and Trump both went to the southern border. Biden highlighted Republican obstruction but called on Trump to work with him, aiming to show voters which party wants to work on the issue. Since then, Trump has focused on denunciations of Biden and claims of border chaos stoked by sinister forces. Expect such contrasts on loop.\n\nEquality\n\nRon DeSantis made attacks on LGBTQ+ rights a hallmark of his attempt to \"Make America Florida\". The governor's failed campaign suggests how well that went down but Republican efforts to demonise so-called \"woke\" ideology should not be discounted. States have introduced anti-trans legislation, book bans and restrictions on LGBTQ+ issues in education. The US supreme court weighed in by ending race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nStruggles over immigration, and Republicans' usual focus on crime, show race-inflected battles will play their usual role, particularly as Trump uses extremist \"blood and soil\" rhetoric. On the Democratic side, a worrying sign: Black and Hispanic support is less sure than it was.\n\nIt makes tactical sense: the threat to women's reproductive rights is a rare issue on which Democrats poll very strongly, fuelling electoral wins in conservative states. This year's Alabama IVF ruling, which said embryos should be legally treated as people, showed the potency of such tactics again: from Trump down, Republicans scrambled to deny wanting to end treatment used by millions.\n\nTrump must balance boasting about ending Roe, by appointing three justices who voted to strike it down, with trying to avoid blame for attacks on reproductive rights even as his supporters call for, and implement, harsher abortion bans. Expect Biden and Democrats to hit and keep on hitting.\n\nForeign policy\n\nFor Biden, the Israel-Gaza war presents a fiendish proposition: how to satisfy or merely mollify both the Israel lobby and large sections of his own party, particularly the left and the young, more sympathetic to the Palestinians.\n\nSpiralling and ongoing campus protests against Israel's pounding of Gaza show the danger of coming unglued from the base. So do protest votes against Biden in the Democratic primary. Republicans have no such worries: they are simply pro-Israel.\n\nElsewhere, Biden continues to lead a global coalition in support of Ukraine in its fight against Russia, scoring a win at home in April as the Republican speaker of the US House, Mike Johnson, finally oversaw passage of a new aid bill despite fierce opposition from the right of his party. Throw in the lasting effects of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan (teed up by Trump, fumbled by Biden), questions about what happens if China attacks Taiwan, and the threat Trump poses to Nato, and heavy fire on foreign policy is guaranteed.\n\nDemocracy\n\nBiden is keen to stress the threat to democracy at home. After all, Trump refused to accept the result of the 2020 election, incited the deadly attack on Congress of 6 January 2021, is linked to plans to slash the federal government in a second term, and even says he wants to be a \"dictator\" on day one.\n\nTrump maintains the lie that his 2020 defeat was the result of electoral fraud even as his various criminal cases proceed, 14 of 88 charges concerning election subversion. The other 74 charges concern hush-money payments (34, now on trial in New York) and retention of classified information (40, going slowly in Florida).\n\nIt should be easy to portray an 88-times indicted potential felon as a threat to constitutional order, particularly given Trump's clear need to win power as a way of avoiding prison. Accordingly, the issue has been profitable for Biden at the polls. But some doubt its potency. David Axelrod, a close ally of Barack Obama, told the New Yorker: \"I'm pretty certain in Scranton [Pennsylvania, Biden's home town] they're not sitting around their dinner table talking about democracy every night.\"\n\nClimate\n\nFrom forest fires to hurricanes and catastrophic floods, it is clear climate change is real. Polling reflects this: 70% of Americans - strikingly, 50% of Republicans included - want meaningful action. But that isn't reflected in Republican campaigning. Trump says he doesn't believe human activity contributes to climate change, nor that climate change is making extreme weather worse, and is opposed to efforts to boost clean energy. Biden's record on climate may be criticised by campaigners but his record in office places him firmly and clearly against such dangerous views.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_the_economy,_stupid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "It's the economy, stupid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Carville", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Carville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George H.

However, polls released this week paint a bleak picture.\n\nIndeed, a new national poll from CNN shows former President Donald Trump leading President Biden by 6 points in a head-to-head horserace, 49 percent to 43 percent. Worse, just one-third (34 percent) of voters approve of Biden's handling of the economy, a tried and true metric for how Americans will likely vote.\n\nPut another way, if consumer sentiment is any indication of Biden's electoral fate, Democrats have reason to worry. In fact, 65 percent of registered voters say the economy is \"extremely important\" to them. And, in analyzing how this group of economic-centric voters plan to cast their ballots, Biden is projected to lose by over 30 points, 62 percent to 30 percent.\n\nIn that same vein, state-level polling from Fox News shows Trump is back in the driver's seat, with his New York City trial doing little to dent his numbers. The poll shows Trump leading Biden in the seven key swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- by anywhere from 1 to 5 points, making his path to victory slimmer by the day.\n\nMoreover, while pluralities of voters in each state agree that the Trump \"hush money\" trial is \"appropriate\" or fair, per Fox News, most voters, especially Republicans, say a guilty verdict would have no impact on their willingness to vote for Trump, and in many cases, would increase their likelihood to vote for him.\n\nWhile these are just two polls, it's clear that Trump is back in the lead, even if he's been found in contempt and threatened with jail time. In truth, these polls reveal a trend that should alarm the Biden campaign, which surely had felt the momentum turning in their favor after the State of the Union.\n\nFrom February through mid-April, polls showed Biden, if still trailing Trump, trending in the right direction. In fact, there was a point in which Biden was leading Trump in 18 national polls during that time.\n\nFurther, Biden was racking up a series of wins, including improving economic sentiment, a key metric the administration was desperately trying to move the needle on. In addition, the initial news fodder surrounding Trump, who had just begun spending most of his time in the courtroom rather than on the campaign trail, consumed the media's attention.\n\nWhile Trump was stuck in court, Biden pulled in massive donations to pad his cash lead over his opponent. At one Radio City fundraiser where Biden was joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the Biden campaign raised more than $25 million -- a record.\n\nFor the GOP, Republican infighting was -- and still is -- on full display in the House, damaging the credibility of the entire party. On Wednesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.) announced she would force a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) who relied on Democratic support to pass a series of foreign aid bills last week. Worse, a scandal plagued the GOP's biggest fundraising arm, the Republican National Committee, during this time, causing mass layoffs and leadership changes.\n\nYet, despite all this momentum, Biden's surge appears to have stalled.\n\nAs I wrote in these pages one month ago, Biden's biggest obstacle to reelection is the overall perception that he is bad for the economy and people's personal financial situation. And, as inflation proves stubborn, wars in Europe and the Middle East show no sign of slowing down, American college campuses are swarmed with protests against Israel and the southern border remains open, Biden has done little to change people's perceptions.\n\nHowever, Biden's marks on all three issues -- the economy, foreign policy, and immigration -- are markedly down since entering office. In January 2020, 61 percent approved of Biden's handling of the economy, 60 percent approved of his handling of foreign affairs, and 57 percent approved of his handling of immigration, per Harvard/Harris.\n\nToday, Biden's approval rating across all three metrics is underwater -- 42 percent on the economy, 42 percent on foreign affairs and 38 percent on immigration -- according to the most recent Harvard/Harris poll released last week.\n\nWhether due to inflation driving economic pessimism, the still-porous southern border keeping immigration at the top of voters' minds, or the growing chaos on college campuses, Biden appears to be leaping from one crisis to the next, seemingly unable to effectively manage or lead the country.\n\nTo be clear, this is not to make it seem like the election is in the bag for Trump. The former president faces a mountain of legal problems, and the GOP primary results show that Nikki Haley is still attracting double-digit support despite dropping out of the race.\n\nSimilarly, there are legitimate questions of whether progressives, whose anger at Biden over his support for Israel has boiled over and threatens to cause mayhem at the Democratic National Convention this summer, actually withhold their votes when faced with a Trump presidency.\n\nThat being said, after a brief period where it looked like Biden had finally found his groove, his numbers are once again dropping while Trump's rise, and that is surely a worrying sign for Democrats as November rapidly approaches.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "douglas_e_schoen@thehill.com", "name": "Douglas E.

Following an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, Trump was indicted in March 2023 on 34 counts of allegedly falsifying business records related to secret payments made to the star. adult film Stormy Daniels during her 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the charges against him were politically motivated.\n\nDespite Trump's legal troubles, which include three other criminal indictments - all of which he has pleaded not guilty to - the poll race remains tight between the former president and his likely challenger in November, President Joe Biden, the incumbent Democrat.\n\nHowever, that could change if Trump is found guilty. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll by Langer Research Associates conducted April 25-30 and released Sunday, 80 percent of Trump supporters said they would continue to support him if he were convicted of a crime in the secret of money. case. Meanwhile, 20 percent of his base would reconsider their support (16 percent) or withdraw their support for Trump (4 percent).\n\nThe sample size of the subgroup of Trump supporters was 937 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4. The national sample size of the survey was 2,260 adults and the margin of error for the full sample was 2 percentage points. Of the national sample, 31 percent were Democrats, 29 percent Republicans and 28 percent independents.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to both the Trump and Biden campaigns for comment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump attends his trial for allegedly concealing hush money payments at Manhattan Criminal Court on May 3 in New York.

Trump is doing himself a disservice with his antics before, during and after his days in court. If he loses in the trial court, he loses big in the court of public opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, results varied in a showdown between Trump and Biden, depending on how the adults surveyed identified themselves.\n\nLooking at all adults surveyed, excluding those who said they would not vote, 46% supported Trump while 44% supported Biden. However, Biden led Trump among registered and likely voters. In total, 46% of registered voters supported Biden while 45% supported Trump. Meanwhile, 49 percent of likely voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump.\n\nAlthough it remains unclear how much damage a felony conviction in any of the four criminal indictments may have on Trump's campaign, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Feb. 9-12 found that 55 % of American adults would not vote for Trump if he were elected. convicted of a crime. This figure is 51 percent among Republicans.\n\nThe total sample size for this poll was 1,237 people, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.91.

He says the alleged affair never happened.\n\nBut polls show the charges carry some electoral risk: A poll conducted by ABC News and Ipsos in April 2023 found that 52% of Americans viewed the New York charges against Trump as significant.\n\nAnd a new ABC News/Ipsos poll found that a fifth of Trump's supporters said they would either reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%) if he's convicted of a felony.\n\nAt the same time, with the weekslong trial still ongoing, the details don't appear to be changing many minds, according to recent interviews with seven voters who were polled by ABC and Ipsos last year, both those who felt Trump's charges were at least somewhat serious and those who didn't.\n\nThe voter interviews suggested that their strong opinions of the former president are coloring how they are reacting to the twists and turns of the hush money trial -- rather than the other way around.\n\n\"Yes,\" Charles Carabelli, a Michigan retiree who identifies as an independent and said last year the charges were very serious, told ABC News when asked if he was keeping up with the trial. \"And I hope he [Trump] gets convicted.\"\n\nWhen pressed on what makes him think the case is serious, rather than pointing to specific details, Carabelli tied his views to his opinion of Trump more broadly: \"Because he's a shyster and a liar. And he lied to the American people. He's all about himself.\"\n\nJames Mitchell, a retired lawyer and Republican from Wyoming, indicated he didn't feel the trial would ultimately matter.\n\n\"Am I really keeping up on it? Not really because, yes, it's serious, [but] I think the system's rigged,\" said Mitchell, who last year called the charges somewhat serious.\n\nInterviews with Trump's defenders showed a similar trend.\n\nRay Flores, a 77-year-old Marine Corps veteran and Republican who lives in Dyer, Indiana, said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 and has been keeping up with the trial as well but believes it is a \"sham,\" echoing claims of persecution from Trump himself, which prosecutors deny. Flores said in last year's poll that he felt the hush money charges were not serious.\n\n\"It's all political what they're doing to Trump,\" he said in an interview. \"Everything was good four years ago. I have no complaints from then.\"\n\nOne of the voters who said last year that the case was very serious expressed openness to coming around to Trump -- entirely separate from the details of the case.\n\nFelicia Anderson, a home health nurse from Fullerton, California, said in an interview that she's leaning toward voting for President Biden in November. But a change in tone from Trump could sway her.\n\n\"To me, he talks down to people. If he would learn not to talk down to people, oh, he has me,\" Anderson, who said she identifies as a Democratic-leaning independent, told ABC News.\n\nSome outside political experts predicted that any political fallout from the trial may be blunted unless Trump ends up behind bars -- an unlikely scenario for a first-time offender in a case such as the one in New York.\n\n\"I think they're probably following it less closely, and it's just kind of background noise right now,\" GOP pollster Robert Blizzard said of voters. \"Now, if something happens, he gets thrown in jail or there's some huge thing that comes out that nobody knows about yet, that has the potential to maybe shift some attitudes.\"\n\n\"But Trump's gonna get what Trump's gonna get,\" Blizzard said, referencing the former president's likely share of the electorate.\n\nExperts note that Trump, a brash-talking and often controversial real estate mogul and former reality TV star with universal name recognition and a well-established public persona, has seen his political career survive a series of scandals, none of which have upended his standing with the Republican base. Early polls this year show him in a close race with Biden.\n\n\"The attitudes toward everything revolving around Trump's legal issues coincides directly with your preconceived attitudes toward Trump,\" Blizzard, the pollster, said.\n\nThat's not to say the trial hasn't been newsy, including fights over Trump's conduct regarding a gag order, headline-making details about how a tabloid publisher said he worked to quash unflattering stories for Trump and emotional testimony from a former aide.\n\nTrump faces other notable legal problems, including three other pending trials -- over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office and his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss. He has pleaded not guilty in all cases.\n\nBut even if any of those cases are heard ahead of the election -- a big if -- the political fallout could remain the same without a conviction or acquittal before voting ends, Blizzard said.\n\n\"When we do an open-ended question on a survey or when you're doing qualitative focus groups or things like that, nobody is bringing up Trump trials organically,\" he told ABC News. \"It's just not in the bloodstream and not something that people are paying attention to on a day-to-day basis as much as the media thinks.\"", "source": {"uri":

The new survey provides a road map of the persuadables most open to appeals in a campaign being shaped by sharp divides on abortion and immigration as well as an unprecedented criminal trial of a former president, now underway in New York.\n\nWhat's more, 8% are now supporting independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and an additional 5% backing other third-party contenders. Most of their supporters acknowledge they might switch their allegiances before they cast a ballot.\n\nTiffany Batton, 43, an independent from Chicago who was among those surveyed, plans to vote for Biden. \"He inherited a lot of problems from the last administration,\" the social worker said in a follow-up phone interview. \"I feel like, if given a chance, he could fulfill some of those campaign promises if he had another four years.\"\n\nBut she might change her mind, depending on what happens in the Mideast and elsewhere. \"The war in Israel has been weighing really heavy on me,\" she said.\n\nBrett Watchom, 36, a shipping clerk from Denver who is also an independent, backs Kennedy, attracted by his position on housing and because he is \"the only one not part of the horrible uni-party machine.\"\n\nHe allowed that he might switch his support \"if the Libertarian candidate turns out to be better.\"\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe candidates have limited time ahead to make their case.\n\n\"When we think about the race tied with just 26 weeks to go, we have to consider that people tune out politics and the party conventions in July and August,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"That leaves just 17 weeks for candidates to actively campaign, and it's actually 13 or 14 weeks when you consider states where early voting starts weeks before Election Day.\n\n\"We're basically at the doorstep of the election, and the outcome is a coin flip.\"\n\nBiden gains among Black voters, Trump loses among young voters\n\nThe new poll shows Biden's standing against Trump improving inch-by-inch, albeit within the survey's margin of error.\n\nIn the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll taken in January, Biden trailed Trump by 3 points - 34%-37% - and in March he trailed by 2, at 38%-40%. Now they're even.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, Biden has gained ground among some key voters while Trump has lost it.\n\nAmong voters under 35 years old, Biden has gained 1 percentage point and Trump has lost 12 since the survey in January. Biden now holds a lead, 34%-25%, although not the overwhelming one he scored in the 2020 election.\n\nAmong Hispanic voters, Biden's support has stayed the same, but Trump has lost 11 points. Biden now leads 34%-28%, still short of the 2-1 edge he had in 2020.\n\nAmong independents, Biden has gained 5 points, and Trump has lost 4. Now the two are essentially tied, with Trump at 27% and Biden at 26%. Nearly as many, 22%, are undecided, and 23% are supporting third-party candidates.\n\nAmong Black voters, Biden has gained 7 points since January while Trump's standing hasn't changed. They now support Biden by 64%-12% - better than before, though still far short of the 87% who voted for him in 2020.\n\nThe White House has recently announced policy decisions and aired political ads that have particular appeal to some younger swing voters, including moving to ease federal regulation of marijuana and relieve some college student debt. This month, Biden is slated to deliver the commencement address at Morehouse College, an historically Black school.\n\nWho's in play? Young voters, Hispanic voters, independents and RFK backers\n\nThe strength of the third-party candidates may be built on sand.\n\nEight in 10 of those supporting Kennedy say they might change their minds before they vote. So do 88% of those supporting independent Cornel West, 65% of those who plan to support the Libertarian nominee, and 58% backing Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nTypically the support for third-party candidates declines as Election Day nears, although in close elections the impact of drawing only thousands of voters in swing states can tip the election outcome.\n\nIn 2016, the Green Party candidate took votes from Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, crucial states she ended up losing. In 2020, the Libertarian candidate drew voters from Trump in Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, critical states he lost.\n\n\"I'm leaning towards Joe Biden, and I'll tell you why: I look at his record on the economy,\" said Al Wilson, 56, an independent from Shelby, Michigan, who works as the production manager for an auto manufacturer. He credits the president with restoring the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also cites Biden's presidential \"deportment,\" implicitly contrasting it with Trump. \"We need leadership that is not (in) the news cycle all the time,\" he said. \"I get sick of that. I don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear controversy. I don't want you involved in controversy all the time.\"\n\nOther swing voters also say they might change their minds before November, including 43% of independents. Nearly half of independent women, 47%, are open to persuasion, one reason the Biden campaign has focused so intently on abortion access as an issue.\n\nSome groups that Democrats rely on in national elections say their minds aren't firmly made up. That includes 37% of Hispanic voters, 27% of Black voters and 44% of voters under 35.\n\nMore than two-thirds of those surveyed (69%) say the country is \"on the wrong track;\" fewer than 1 in 4 (23%) say it is \"headed in the right direction.\" That's a tick less positive than the nation's mood in the March survey.\n\n\"I haven't made up my mind yet,\" said Emily Weller, 39, a Republican from Indianapolis. \"I would not vote for former President Trump; I don't think that I would vote for President Biden,\" the stay-at-home mom said. \"My vote matters to me and I want to vote, but it's not cut-and-dried.\"\n\n'Everything was better under Trump'\n\nThen there are those voters definitely not in play.\n\nThose now supporting Biden say by 84%-14% that their minds are firmly made up. Trump supporters are set by a similarly wide 83%-16%.\n\n\"Everything was better under Trump,\" declared Mike McCombs, 67, a Republican and an independent insurance agent from Lincolnton, Georgia. \"The economy was better. Fuel prices were better. Biden has choked the middle class to death.\"\n\nA conviction of Trump in his current trial, on charges relating to paying hush money to a porn star, wouldn't change his view. \"It would probably make me support him more because this is a rigged trial anyway,\" he said.\n\nBoth major-party candidates have solidified their standing among their partisans. Now 87% of Democrats back Biden, up 7 points since January; 84% of Republicans back Trump, up 5 points.\n\nA negligible 2% of Democrats and 1% of Republicans are crossing the aisle to support the other major party's presumptive nominee.\n\n\"I liked the way he ran the country when he was president the first time,\" said Stephen Harrison, 52, a small-business owner and Trump supporter from Manhattan, Montana. \"The economy is No. 1. He did a good job of keeping things running and open best he could during the pandemic.\n\n\"The only thing that would change my mind is if he isn't on the ballot,\" he said.\n\nFrancis Spitale, 60, a Democrat from Charleston, South Carolina, who cares for newborns, says her support for Biden is unshakable.\n\n\"Are all the policies perfect?\" she asked. \"No. But I respect him as a good, decent human being who has been able to accomplish more in two or three years than a lot of other presidents have been able to.\"\n\nShe dismissed those who say Biden, at 81, is too old to serve another term.\n\n\"No one's saying the (Rolling) Stones are too old to have a concert; Bruce Springsteen is out there at 73,\" she said. \"If you are a productive person, you don't have to be skateboarding and skiing down the slopes to be effective.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biden and Trump tie 37%-37% as Hispanic, Black, younger voters shift", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sudiksha_kochi@aol.com", "name": "Sudiksha Kochi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Libertarian Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political polarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

We need to face that fact now and acknowledge the likelihood that we will be in for another national trauma in about six months.\n\nSome people, like Georgetown Professor Rosa Books, are less worried about what may happen in 2024 than about what happened in 2020, when Donald Trump was in the White House. As Brooks puts it, \"an incumbent has a level of coercive power that a candidate (like Trump) just does not have.\"\n\nBrooks expects this year, \"with Biden still in office, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security would be successful in keeping any political violence from getting out of control.\"\n\nOr, as an analysis in The Washington Post says, if Trump loses \"he won't be the incumbent president he was in 2020, debating about the federal government\u202fseizing voting machines, reportedly entertaining conversations about\u202fimposing martial law, using the presidential megaphone to convince his supporters that rampant voter fraud stole a second term from him.\"\n\nBut even the Post concedes that Trump \"will still have an unusually strong bond with his followers. Some of the 2021 rioters said\u202fhe motivated them, raising questions of what he might do if defeated in 2024.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump is leaving little to the imagination about what he might do after the election, and Americans cannot afford to be complacent about what might unfold.\n\nTrump has made clear that 2024 will be a high-stakes election. \"This is the final battle. ... Either they win, or we win.\"\n\nHe has ominously predicted that \"If we don't win this election, I don't think you're going to have another election in this country,\"\n\nAnd more than a year ago, Trump refused to commit to accept the results of the 2024 presidential election. At that time, the former president said he would only accept the 2024 results if he believes no voter fraud occurred. \"If I think it's an honest election,\" he said, \"I would be honored to.\"\n\nIn the last few days, Donald Trump again has signaled that, whatever the results of the election, he will not go down without a fight.\n\nIn an interview with Time published last Tuesday, Trump tried to sidestep the question about what he would do if he lost while reciting his familiar litany of complaints about 2020.\n\n\"Well, I do think we're gonna win. We're way ahead. I don't think they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time, which were horrible. Absolutely horrible. So many, so many different things they did, which were in total violation of what was supposed to be happening. And you know that, and everybody knows that. We can recite them, go down a list that would be an arm's long. But I don't think we're going to have that. I think we're going to win.\"\n\nHe then acknowledged that he might not concede if he lost. As he put it, \"And if we don't win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election.\"\n\nThis is a reminder that in Trump's world there seem to be only two possible election results. If he wins, the election is fair. If he loses, it is rigged.\n\nOn May 1, Trump again refused to promise he would accept the results of the 2024 presidential election. \"If everything's honest,\" Trump said, \"I'll gladly accept the results. I don't change on that.\u202fIf it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nAs the New York Times observes, \"Mr. Trump's vow to 'fight for the right of the country' also echoes his speech on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, where he told his supporters that\u202f'if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,' before urging his supporters to march to the Capitol.\"\n\nOver the last several months, as the Times puts it, Trump \"has repeatedly tried to sow doubt about the integrity of the fall election, while repeating many of the same lies he used\u202fto assail the integrity of the 2020 election. Months before any voting has taken place, Mr. Trump has regularly made the baseless claim that Democrats are likely to cheat to win.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly called his criminal trial now underway in New York \"election interference.\" \"I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania, Georgia and lots of other places, campaigning, and it's very unfair.\"\n\nHis lawyers have reiterated these election interference arguments as well: \"The Special Counsel,\" they told the Supreme Court in a brief in the presidential immunity case, \"seeks urgently to force President Trump into a months-long criminal trial at the height of campaign season, effectively sidelining him and preventing him from campaigning against the current President.\"\n\nA CNN poll now shows that \"Nearly three-quarters of Americans, 74 percent, believe former\u202fPresident Trump will refuse to concede if he loses the 2024 election.\" That poll noted that this \"a significant increase from similar surveys in 2020.\"\n\nPresident Biden has voiced similar concerns. According to Biden, \"Losers who are losers are never graceful. I just think that he'll do anything to try to win. If - and when - I win, I think he'll contest it. No matter what the result is.\"\n\nBiden is clearly right. The question is what he -- and we -- will do between now and November.\n\nState election officials and the Biden administration need to put in place plans to ensure the fairness of the 2024 election and to defend the election results. The national news media will have a big part to play in that effort.\n\nBut voters must play their part as well.\n\nThe CNN poll found that \"an overwhelming majority of survey respondents, about 86 percent, said the losing candidate in a presidential election has an obligation to concede.\" That is a reassuring finding. But it won't do much good unless the people who feel that way turn their commitment into a voting issue.\n\nOver the next several months, voters need to make clear that they do not want a repeat of 2020. And in November, Americans need to go to the polls and vote against anyone who refuses to discharge his \"obligation to concede.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Will Rikard, a 49-year-old father of two, was among several hundred Democrats who stood and cheered for Joe Biden as the first-term president delivered a fiery speech recently about the billions of dollars he has delivered to protect the states drinking water. But afterward, the Wilmington resident acknowledged he is worried about Bidens political standing in the looming rematch with former Republican President Donald Trump. \"Theres not enough energy,\" Rikard said of Bidens coalition. \"I think people are gonna need to wake up and get going.\" Exactly six months before Election Day, Biden and Trump are locked in the first contest in 112 years with a current and former president competing for the White House. Its a race that is at once deeply entrenched and highly in flux as many voters are only just beginning to embrace the reality of the 2024 campaign. Wars, trials, the independent candidacy of Robert Kennedy Jr. and deep divisions across America have injected extraordinary uncertainty into a race for the White House in which either man would be the oldest president ever sworn in on Inauguration Day. At the same time, policy fights over abortion, immigration and the economy are raging on Capitol Hill and in statehouses.VOTERS IN DENIALHovering over it all is the disbelief of many voters, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Biden and Trump - their respective parties presumptive nominees - will ultimately appear on the general election ballot this fall. \"I think we have an electorate thats going through the stages of grief about this election,\" said Sarah Longwell, who conducts regular focus groups with voters across the political spectrum as co-founder of Republican Voters Against Trump. \"Theyve done denial - Not these two, cant possibly be these two. And I think theyre in depression now. Im waiting for people to hit acceptance.\" Trump is in the midst of the first of potentially four criminal trials and facing felony charges. The Constitution does not prevent him from assuming the presidency if convicted - or even if he is in prison. Biden, who will turn 82 years old just weeks after Election Day, Nov. 5, is already the oldest president in U.S. history; Trump is 77. Privately, Democratic operatives close to the campaign worry constantly about Bidens health and voters dim perceptions of it. In recent weeks, aides have begun walking at Bidens side as he strolls to and from Marine One, the presidential helicopter, on the White House South Lawn in an apparent effort to help mask the presidents stiff gait. Still, neither party is making serious contingency plans. Whether voters want to believe it or not, the general election matchup is all but set.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said many voters are recovering from what he called \"a knock-down, drag-out fight\" that was the 2020 presidential election. \"Many of them have not wrapped their heads around the fact that it is, in fact, going to be a rematch,\" Cooper said in an interview. \"When they do, I dont think theres any question that Joe Biden is going to win the day.GETTING TO 270 ELECTORIAL VOTES - THE BATTLEGROUND STATESEven before voters begin paying close attention, the political map in the fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency is already taking shape. Bidens campaign is increasingly optimistic about North Carolina, a state he lost by just 1 percentage point in 2020. Overall, the Democratic presidents reelection campaign has several hundred staff in more than 133 offices in the seven most critical states: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and North Carolina.Trumps team has barely begun to roll out swing-state infrastructure, although he campaigned in Wisconsin and Michigan over the past week, sending a clear signal that he wants to block Bidens path to reelection via the Democrats Midwestern \"blue wall.Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said Trump is making plans to invest new resources in at least two other Democratic-leaning states. At a private donor retreat in Florida on Saturday, LaCivita discussed the campaigns plans to expand its electoral map into Virginia and Minnesota, based on the Trump teams growing optimism that both states are within reach. \"We have a real opportunity to expand the map here,\" LaCivita told The Associated Press. \"The Biden campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and in their vaunted ground game. And they have nothing to show for it.\" Bidens campaign welcomed Trumps team to spend money in Democratic states. \"The Biden campaign is going to relentlessly focus on the pathway to 270 electoral votes, and thats what our efforts represent, campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.Biden has been spending far more aggressively on election infrastructure and advertising heading into the six-month stretch toward Election Day. In the eight weeks since Trump essentially clinched the Republican nomination, his campaign has spent virtually nothing on television advertising, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Outside groups aligned with Trump have spent just over $9 million. Over the same period, AdImpact found, Biden and his allies have spent more than $29 million spread across Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Trumps team has been unusually conservative, in part, to avoid the perceived mistakes of 2020 when his campaign essentially ran out of money and was forced to cut back on advertising in critical final days but also because it has struggled to reignite its appeal with small donors and because of diversion of some dollars to former presidents legal defense.Trumps team insists it will soon ramp up its advertising and on-the-ground infrastructure although LaCivita refused to offer any specifics.VOTERS UNDERWHELMED WITH THEIR OPTIONSIt is clear that Biden and Trump have serious work to do to improve their standing with voters. While optimistic in public Biden allies privately acknowledge that his approval ratings may be lower than Democrat Jimmy Carters numbers at this point in his presidency.Trumps ratings are not much better.Public polling consistently shows that voters dont like their 2024 options.Only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be excited by Biden 21% or Trump 25% being elected president according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in March.Only about one-quarter of voters in survey say they would be satisfied about each.A CNN poll conducted in April found that 53% of registered voters say they are dissatisfied with presidential candidates they have to choose from this years election.Another major wild card is Kennedy,a member of storied political dynasty an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who is running as an independent.Both major campaigns are taking him seriously as potential spoiler with Trumps allies notably ramping up their criticism of Kennedy recent days.BIDENS PLAN: REMIND VOTERS WHAT TRUMPS PRESIDENCY WAS LIKEFor now Bidens team is most focused on reminding voters of Trumps divisive leadership.Three years after Trump left office there is sense that some voters may have forgotten what it was like with former reality television star Oval Office - or his efforts overturn 2020 election that landed him legal peril.\"The plan is reminding voters what life was like with Trump also demonstrating voters ways which world feels uncertain them now are not fact caused by president but can actually navigated by this president,Biden pollster Mary Murphy told AP.Voters will trust his leadership stewardship knowing things can lot worse if its Donald Trump.\"Bidens team also betting fierce backlash new restrictions abortion which Trump Republicans largely championed will drive voters Democrats like did 2022 midterm election 2023 state races.But Bidens success also dependent Democrats ability reassemble his winning coalition from 2020 time when enthusiasm lagging among critical voting blocs including Blacks young Arab Americans unhappy over presidents handling war Gaza.TRUMPS PLAN: TURN HIS LEGAL WOES TO HIS ADVANTAGETrump has been forced adapt his campaign first criminal trial New York.Prosecutors allege committed financial fraud hide hush money payments porn actor Stormy Daniels who says she had sexual encounter with Trump.He denies her claim pleaded not guilty.For now Trump forced attend trial most weekdays.A verdict likely still weeks away.And after faces prospect more trials related efforts overturn 2020 election handling classified documents.Supreme Court weighing whether should granted immunity or partial immunity actions took while office.Trump past week wedged campaign stops around court schedule rallying voters Wisconsin Michigan where abortion debate raging.Trump seemed searching way lessen political sting upheaval over Supreme Courts overturning national abortion rights.Former president suggested issue will ultimately bring country together states carve out differing laws.\"A lot bad things will happen beyond abortion issue if you dont win elections your taxes everything else he told Michigan voters.Trumps camp privately maintains unprecedented trial New York will dominate news - voters attention - foreseeable future.His campaign largely stopped trying roll out unrelated news during trial.Even if were convicted by New York jury advisers insist fundamentals election will not change.Trump worked aggressively undermine public confidence charges against him.Meanwhile more traditional issues work favor including stubbornly high inflation situation U.S.-Mexico border view team.LaCivita said such issues constantly reinforce Bidens weakness as news day keeps getting worse.\"Both sides seem agree dynamics race may yet shift dramatically based any number factors from how economy fares course wars Gaza Ukraine crime migration trends other foreseen events.Potential candidate debates fall could another wild card.Such uncertainty said battleground states director Dan Kanninen can play favor.\"That dynamic opportunity much challenge us he said because we will have resources infrastructure operation built engaging voters throughout difficult waters.\"AP RPA", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sathish_raman@oneindia.com", "name": "Sathish Raman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bidens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Accountability_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Accountability Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Longwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Longwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Since then, Biden and the DNC have spent $11.1 million, according to AdImpact.\n\n--With assistance from Bill Allison and Gregory Korte.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Craft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Craft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Craft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Craft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundraising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundraising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539883", "eventUri": "eng-9539883", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 346, "textEnd": 352}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-24", "textStart": 1592, "textEnd": 1599}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

One of those things is Trump bragging about money. How much he has of it. Also how much he's raised/has for his campaign. I heard advance reporting that an exclusive, no press/cameras event with deep pocket donors would take place at a secure Four Seasons (not Mar A Lago? Hmmm) event last night. But no projections on the expected \"take\" and I use that word deliberately. And so far today (after five pm where I live) no news on how much was raised.\n\nI for one find that more than a little curious. Again, Trump not only craves the appearance of being loaded (with money) his political image requires it. Being a super-duper successful business guy is one of the things MAGAs love about him. Being broke, and worse being seen as such is the kind of thing that can break the spell. So Trump brags about how much money he raises, even in daily (multiple times per day) email pitches he makes to his MAGAs about how much cash he's amassing to defeat Biden this November. (MAGAs too often can't make sense of only one idea - thinking about two opposing ones at the same time is beyond them) So Trump has to reassure the MAGAs that he's competing with Biden when it comes to fundraising.\n\nRemember when Biden & Harris had that big fundraiser at Radio City Music Hall over a month ago? Going in journalists were breathless about the anticipated $25 million it would raise. (and it did) Trump of course said he'd have a bigger one and to great fanfare announced a FIFTY million fundraiser less than a week later. He claimed to have gotten it, although I saw little actual reporting about FEC filings to back it up. There IS after all a difference between pledges and actual money changing hands/bank accounts.\n\nSo let's look at this past weekend. A \"bigly\" fundraiser was planned. Trump has since his criminal trial began complained about not being able to get out on the campaign trail. Ok, so last Wednesday he did finally make a couple of campaign stops in the midwest. But all week long the focus for Trump has been this weekend and the major fundraiser he'd be doing down in Florida. The thing is, unlike early April there wasn't bigly talk about how much would be raised. I found that interesting for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost is that given the price of admission, and the HUGE price to get a seat at Trump's table, or at least \"special access\" to him he should have had a pretty good starting point for an estimate on how much would be raised last night. The second is the lack of information on the actual donors, or perhaps it might be more accurate to say potential donors. We've heard the reporting that mega donors were holding back, along with the predictions that if/when Trump became the presumptive nominee they'd open up their wallets, however grudgingly. Some, but not many have publicly stepped up but it seems to me like most are trying to downplay financial support for Trump.\n\nI also find it interesting that journalists are so completely in the dark about that closed-off dinner last night, or haven't been naming names both before the event and today. Kind of makes me wonder if the bosses in the Executive Suites are afraid of offending corporate bigwigs who might have hinted at taking their advertising dollars elsewhere! Regardless, the fact is there has been precious little reporting both before and after about how much money was expected to be raised, and how much actually was.\n\nOn my homepage I haven't seen a single story about the event. The best reporting I saw was here on Politizoom where Ursula wrote about the Mar A Lago shindig last night. That outdoor whatever the hell it was that seemed more like a tacky, cheap knockoff of an ancient Roman Circus. Which is about what one should expect from Trump and at Mar A Lago. So I typed a query into the search engine and it came back with some stories that mostly talked about Trump's remarks, with the \"Gestapo\" reference about the Biden administration being the dominant theme.\n\nHowever, a story by Marketwatch provided a more detailed review, but still not much regarding actual money raised. It wasn't much, as you can see:\n\nThe Republican National Committee said after the event that joint fundraising efforts by the RNC and the campaign for April topped $76 million, by far the best monthly effort of this campaign cycle and a step toward closing Biden's financial advantage. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley hailed an uptick in small-dollar donors, but the Mar-a-Lago event clearly focused on the party's deepest pockets. At one point, one attendee said, Trump offered an open microphone to anyone who immediately pledged a $1 million contribution to the party. Two people eventually agreed, the source said.\n\nSo let's recap. All week long we heard about this big mega-donor fundraiser Trump would be having this weekend. We also as the week went on heard about the weekend also being a combination of vetting/auditioning VP candidates. I might have missed it but I don't recall much pre weekend reporting about the gaudy, tacky afternoon even at Trump's actual home. Apparently many of the guests for last night's main even were invited although it's unclear how many showed up.\n\nTrump I believe has no intention of picking a VP anytime soon. I have some troubling thoughts on who it might wind up being I'll address later today or tomorrow. Personally, I think having Kristi Noem leave before inviting the gang of \"potentials\" onto the stage was Trump's way of trying to reassure mega donors that \"credible\" people like Elise Stefanik, Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and even Marsha Blackburn were on a \"short list\" that doesn't really exist. It was nothing but a political dog and pony show - no puppy killers allowed.\n\nStill, almost a day later from the big dinner event that was supposed to generate a massive amount of donations I find it incredible that Trump's not bragging about how much money was raised! After the week he had in court he sure needs something to brag about. So if he'd gotten a sh*tload of donations why isn't Trump, and the RNC making a BFD about it today instead of talking about what was jointly raised back in April? Granted this is pure speculation on my part but here goes:\n\nMy guess is that Trump probably got $20M (perhaps twenty-five or so) in actual donations, and the rest was only pledges. Pledges with conditions! Those mega donors, especially those who run or are synonymous with major corporations are skittish about being associated with Trump. Plus, polls aside they have real worries about him winning in November. In the middle of a criminal trial that's clearly NOT going well for him they are worried well before the convention Trump will simply be too damaged goods to win. Keep in mind Trump is drowning in a Manhattan courtroom and there are weeks to go in his trial. It's going to get worse for him.\n\nIf all that wasn't enough to put a damper on mega donor enthusiasm consider this: Even though SCOTUS has effectively blocked a DC trial before the election they might remand the case to judge Chutkan for \"fact finding\" to determine what is or is not covered by \"outer boundaries\" of duties in the \"Presidential Immunity\" they want to create.\n\nWe'll hear more about this if it goes down that way but some legal pundits have already noted that such fact-finding will involve court hearings. During which much of the information/evidence Jack Smith, using powers the J6 Committee didn't have has obtained. At least some of the very stuff Trump most definitely does not want and frankly can't afford to be made public. Possibly before the GOP convention. Even worse would be after. DOJ might have that 60 day policy about going dark but the case is now in judge Chutkan's hands. Even if theoretically she could start a trial in say September practically speaking she can't. A hearing on the other hand is a different story!\n\nSo yes, I can see mega donors being skittish about dropping huge sums on Trump's campaign and instead hedging their bets. And that's why the news this afternoon, or as far as I know Truth Social being flooded with Trumpian boasting about a YUGE fundraising haul this weekend. I'm sure he did okay. Just not enough to go bragging about.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "denis_elliott@politizoom.com", "name": "Denis Elliott",

A shortlist", "body": "Donald Trump has secured the necessary delegates to win the Republican presidential nomination for a third consecutive election. That result was never in much doubt, but the contest to be Trump's running mate is harder to predict. Once again, the Republican primaries demonstrated his strength among white men in rural areas, leading to speculation that he will choose a woman or person of colour to broaden his appeal in November.\n\nHere are some factors to consider and a look at the likely contenders.\n\nWhy does Trump need a new running mate?\n\nFormer vice-president Mike Pence was a useful ally during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, a Christian conservative who shored up support among Republicans suspicious of the thrice-married reality TV star. But Pence's refusal to comply with his boss's demand to overturn the 2020 election led to a falling out and made Pence a perceived traitor and target of the January 6 insurrectionists. After a failed bid for president in 2024, Pence recently said in an interview that he will not be endorsing Trump.\n\nWhat is Trump looking for in a 2024 VP?\n\nHe may decide he needs a female running mate to make himself less toxic to suburban women, especially with abortion rights looming large as an election issue. But history suggests that he will have three priorities: a person who displays loyalty; a person who looks like they are from \"central casting\"; a person who knows their place and will not outshine him on the campaign trail.\n\nWill Trump's VP pick matter in the 2024 election?\n\nProbably not a lot. There is little evidence that a woman on the ticket draws more female voters or that a running mate's home state will necessarily back them. Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under President Barack Obama, told the New York Times: \"The vice-presidential pick is something that generates a massive amount of press coverage but has the most minimal of impacts on the election.\"\n\nBut perhaps a bad pick can do damage: Republican nominee John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin in 2008 probably didn't help. This year, however, Joe Biden and Donald Trump are, again, the two oldest candidates in history, giving new meaning to their VP picks being only \"a heartbeat away from the presidency\".\n\nRelated: Who is running for president in 2024? Biden, Trump and the full list of candidates\n\nHow many VPs have gone on to become president?\n\nFifteen. Eight of these succeeded to the office on the death of a president, including Lyndon Johnson, who was sworn in onboard Air Force One after the assassination of John F Kennedy. Gerald Ford was the only unelected vice-president and president following the resignations of Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon. Biden served as vice-president under Barack Obama, who was succeeded by Trump, who was then defeated by Biden for the presidency.\n\nWhat to know about the Republicans on Trump's vice-president shortlist\n\nThe Texas politician is a Trump loyalist and hardliner on border security who has fought a series of legal battles with the Biden White House. Trump said he \"would very much consider Abbott\" for vice-president during a joint Fox News interview in February. Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, said he was \"committed to governing Texas\" and to his own re-election campaign.\n\nOccupation: Conservative political commentator and writer\n\nThe former Fox News host is a strong ideological match. Like Trump, he relishes offending liberals, praising autocrats such as Vladimir Putin of Russia and Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary (he conducted fawning interviews with both) and pushing the far-right \"great replacement\" theory that western elites are importing immigrant voters to supplant white people. Although Carlson once wrote of Trump in a text message, \"I hate him passionately\", more recently he has praised him as \"sensible and wise\".\n\nBorn in Detroit to a single mother with a third- grade education who worked multiple jobs to support her family, Carson rose to become a leading neurosurgeon - a life story that the Trump campaign could promote as it seeks to win over aspirational Black votes. As housing secretary, Carson was among Trump's longest-serving cabinet members. He remained loyal to the outgoing president after the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol and campaigned with him in Iowa before the caucuses.\n\nDeSantis tried and failed to dethrone Trump as king of the Republican party, flaming out during the primary season. He once made a campaign ad in which he read Trump's book about getting rich, The Art of the Deal, to one of his children and encouraged them to \"build the wall\" along the US-Mexico border by stacking toy bricks. But when he ran for president, Trump branded him \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" and seems unlikely to forgive the perceived disloyalty.\n\nOccupation: Representative for Florida's 19th congressional district\n\nThe Freedom Caucus Republican is one of Trump's most prominent African American supporters and backed him against state governor Ron DeSantis in the primary election. He is short on experience, having only started in Congress in 2021. At an event hosted by Axios, Donalds suggested that he would be willing to decline to certify the 2028 election results if he were vice-president.\n\nThe former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate has rebranded herself as a rightwing media personality. She campaigned for election-denier Kari Lake and other Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections. Her provocative critiques of the western foreign policy establishment, and her overtures to dictators such as Putin and Syria's Bashar al-Assad, are likely to resonate with Trump. Asked in March by Fox News if she would consider a vice-presidential slot, Gabbard replied: \"I would be open to that.\"\n\nOccupation: Representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district\n\nThe far-right flamethrower from Georgia personifies the age of Trumpism with her pugnacious style, bizarre conspiracy theories, indications of support for political violence, and racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements. She once suggested that, if she had led the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, the mob would have been armed and victorious in its efforts to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 victory (she later claimed this was \"sarcasm\").\n\nThe former South Carolina governor was Trump's first ambassador to the United Nations and, as the daughter of Sikh immigrants from India, could help neutralise charges of sexism and racism against him. But her persistence as his most durable opponent during the Republican primary, in which she questioned his age and mental acuity, would be hard for Trump - who called her \"Birdbrain\" - and the Maga base to forgive. They are also at odds on aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe firebrand former TV anchor was the breakout Republican star of the midterm elections but lost the race for governor of Arizona, a result she has never accepted. She was endorsed by Trump and continued to repeat his election lies while campaigning as a surrogate for him during the Republican primary. But she may be seen as more valuable running for Senate because she could help Republicans take control of that chamber if she wins.\n\nThe former pageant queen and congresswoman, serving her second term as South Dakota's governor, gained national attention after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic. But she scored a spectacular own goal by admitting in a new memoir that she shot dead her dog, a 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket, after it killed her neighbour's chickens. The book also included a false claim that she once met the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which Noem has promised to correct in later editions. Her conservative stance on abortion - and media reports of an affair with the former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski - could be a further electoral liability.\n\nThe former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination is a political neophyte who shook up the Republican primary debates, acting as unofficial Trump surrogate and earning the scorn of Haley. Trump condemned Ramaswamy as \"not Maga\" when he gained traction in the opinion polls but has since praised the biotech entrepreneur, who dropped out and threw his weight behind the former president. Ramaswamy is a young person of colour, although his views on the climate crisis are out of step with young voters.\n\nThe former Florida state house speaker was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after stressing his working-class background and \"American dream\" story as the son of Cuban immigrants who worked as a bartender and hotel maid. Rubio ran for president in 2016, winning the Minnesota primary before dropping out of the race eventually won by Trump, who branded him \"Little Marco\". But in the years since then he has become a case study in the Republican party's capitulation to Trump, endorsing him for president in January 2024.\n\nShe was a devoted White House press secretary, tirelessly promoting Trump's agenda and insisting that he was neither racist nor sexist. Last year she was inaugurated as the first woman to serve as governor of Arkansas and she is currently the youngest governor in the country. Her father, former governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, is the creator of The Kids Guide to President Trump and an ex-pastor who might help shore up the Christian evangelical vote.\n\nThe Black evangelical Christian made his own bid for the presidency but dropped out two months before the Iowa caucuses, endorsing Trump and telling him: \"I just love you.\" The senator might be seen as a way to build on Trump's recent progress among male African American voters. Asked about potential running mates during a Fox News town hall in February, Trump pointed to Scott and said: \"A lot of people are talking about that gentleman right over there.\" Scott is single but, with impeccable timing, recently presented his girlfriend with an engagement ring.\n\nOccupation: Representative for New York's 21st congressional district\n\nThe New York politician is the highest-ranking woman in the Republican conference in the House of Representatives and one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump. Once a moderate, she gained national prominence last year after embarrassing the heads of three top universities about antisemitism on their campuses during a congressional hearing, which prompted two of them to later resign.

A one-time Trump critic, he is now an ardent supporter and claims to be fighting for the working class by taking on liberals who \"populate the upper echelons of American government, business, media, entertainment and academia\".

On Monday, he will travel to Wisconsin for the fourth time this year, and then on to Illinois. Since Trump's trial began last month, the former president has only hosted two rallies - in brief dashes to Wisconsin and Michigan last Wednesday.\n\nTrump's strategy - if it is deliberate - is curious. The Manhattan courthouse - where he's accused of falsifying business records in an effort to cover up hush money payments made to former porn star Stormy Daniels - only requires his physical presence four days a week. The court does not sit on Wednesdays or at weekends.\n\nYet Trump has failed to take advantage of his free days, despite grousing about the inequity of being removed from the campaign trail by the criminal process.\n\nWhen the trial began, Trump insisted he would maximise whatever opportunities he had to campaign, even vowing to make stops in heavily Democratic New York. He would, he claimed, \"make a big play\" for the state, insisting that its authorities were engaged in \"election interference\" by bringing charges against him.\n\nSo far, only one event has materialised: a visit last month to Harlem where Trump made false claims about a city crime wave (in reality, violent crime is down in Manhattan and across the US). Trump claims the latest FBI statistics are \"fake numbers\"; fact-checkers say they are accurate.\n\nThere may be several reasons for Trump's decision to stay off the campaign trail. First, the criminal case involves tiring hours in court where - on several occasions - he has nodded off during dull procedure. Trump, a notorious control freak, is reported to be dissatisfied with the performance of his lawyers, and may be spending vital hours outside the court berating them and urging them to shift strategies.\n\nIt is equally possible that Trump wants to do nothing to remove the focus from court. There is evidence the case has helped cement his support, with polling suggesting only three voters in ten believe prosecutors who have brought charges against him in four jurisdictions are treating the former president fairly.\n\nTrump denies all the charges.\n\nHe may also be making a prudent financial choice. Election day is still six months away, and by the end of March, Biden retained a commanding financial advantage over his rival. Trump's lieutenants claim that in April his campaign closed the gap, raising more than $76m, but the veracity of that assertion will only be tested when legal filings are made with the Federal Election Commission later this month.\n\nTrump aides claim that their man will soon return to a full schedule of campaign appearances. There is talk of upcoming fundraisers and rallies in Kentucky, Nevada, and Texas, and visits to New Jersey and Washington, DC.\n\nThe Trump campaign maintains the former president will re-engage with voters in New York. Given that he will be spending four days a week in court there until at least the end of this month, he certainly lacks no shortage of time if he wants to try to put the Democratic stronghold \"in play\".", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_marks@inews.co.uk", "name": "Simon Marks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Trump has been named an unindicted co-conspirator in a scheme to attempt to install fake electors to flip the results of the election fraudulently. Charges were issued Wednesday against 18 Republicans and former aides to Trump. The defendants are charged with crimes including conspiracy and forgery for falsely claiming they were presidential electors and that Trump won the state in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump disputed the results of the 2020 election in Georgia after Biden carried the state by an 11,779-vote margin with nearly 5 million votes cast. A grand jury in Georgia indicted Trump along with 18 defendants in an election interference case. That indictment included dozens of charges, such as violations of Georgia's racketeering law, impersonating a public officer, and making false statements and writings, among others.\n\nA series of election integrity laws have been passed in the state since 2020 that could limit voter access and potentially overburden election officials.\n\nMichigan's attorney general charged 16 people, each with eight crimes, related to the 2020 election. Those charges, handed down in July 2023, include conspiracy to commit forgery and publishing a false record \"with intent to injure or defraud,\" among other counts. People charged include a co-chair of the state's Republican party, a GOP national committeewoman, a former elector, and others active in local government and political leadership.\n\nBiden carried the state with a margin of 154,188 votes with just over 5.5 million cast.\n\nA county grand jury in Nevada charged six Trump electors with two felonies each. Those charges are offering a false instrument and uttering a forged instrument. The individuals charged include state and local GOP leaders.\n\nBiden won Nevada with a margin of 33,596 votes with nearly 1.5 million cast.\n\nTrump attempted to claim victory in Pennsylvania after the election was called for Biden in November 2020. The Pennsylvania attorney general slammed Trump's claim and called it \"devoid of reality\" after the former president attempted to sow doubt in the election results during a post-election GOP event.\n\nBiden won his childhood home state of Pennsylvania by 80,555 votes out of nearly 7 million ballots cast.\n\nTen Republicans in Wisconsin signed a document that falsely claimed they were the \"duly elected and qualified electors\" after Biden won the state in 2020. Biden had won Wisconsin with a margin of 20,682 votes and just over 3 million ballots cast. The Wisconsin attorney general has not said whether his office plans to file charges against the fake electors.\n\nNorth Carolina was Trump's narrowest victory in 2020 when he won the state with a margin of 74,481 votes and 5.5 million ballots cast. Democrats are eyeing the state as flippable, but Republicans remain skeptical.\n\nOut of the roughly 158 million ballots cast for president in 2020, Biden won those six states by approximately 300,000 votes.\n\nTrump needs to bag one of the Midwestern \"Blue Wall\" states that he lost in 2020 to win a second term, according to Axios successfully.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

It always depends on the fairness of an election.\"\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" he later told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nWhen Trump says \"it depends,\" here's the problem: He has never competed in an election that he acknowledged as fair.\n\nEven when he won the presidential election of 2016, he claimed that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats rigged the count to deny him a popular-vote landslide, contending without evidence that millions of noncitizens had voted in California. The official inquiry he ordered up found no significant irregularities.\n\nIn 2020, when he lost to President Biden by 7 million votes, Trump not only claimed the result was illegitimate; he worked for months to overturn it, demanding that state officials \"find\" thousands of new votes in his favor. When his court challenges failed, he summoned supporters to Washington and urged them to march on the Capitol.\n\n\"If you don't fight like hell, you won't have a country any more,\" he told them.

In January, he warned that if his four criminal indictments prevent him from winning, the result will be \"bedlam in the country.\"\n\n\"It's the opening of a Pandora's box,\" he warned.\n\nIn March, he posted a video on his social media account showing an image of Biden hog-tied like a prisoner.\n\nAnd for months he has extolled the defendants convicted of violent crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection as \"hostages,\" promising to pardon many or all if he is reelected.\n\n\"He's telling us what his intentions are, as he did before Jan. 6,\" Juliette Kayyem, a terrorism expert at Harvard University, said recently on PBS. \"The language is the language of incitement. ...

They may not find it an easy choice.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 38% of Americans believe the country needs \"a leader who is willing to break some rules if that's what it takes to set things right.\" That substantial minority included 48% of Republicans.\n\nWhen Time's reporter asked Trump whether his rhetoric about overriding the Constitution and ruling as a \"dictator for a day\" might alienate voters, the former president disagreed.\n\nRead more: Column: Biden says America is 'coming back.'

Through decisions like Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, and Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are advancing democracy by preventing unelected bureaucrats and judges from usurping legislative power and protecting all Americans from race discrimination.\n\nThe U.S. economy thrived during the Trump presidency before COVID-19, aided by Mr. Trump's tax cuts, deregulation, and promotion of fossil fuel production. Cumulative inflation for the first three years of Mr. Trump's presidency was 6%, about 2% per year, compared with cumulative inflation of 18% for President Biden's first three years (Mr. Biden's inflation peaked at over 9%, the highest level in 40 years). In Mr. Trump's first three years, the S&P and Dow Jones indexes climbed 47% and 49%, respectively, gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, and the U.S. became a net energy exporter.\n\nEmployment increased, with Black and Hispanic labor participation rates reaching all-time highs and the overall unemployment rate hitting a 50-year low of 3.5%. Under Mr. Trump, wages rose sharply, and the poverty rate plummeted to an all-time low of 10.5%. On a percentage basis, earnings and net worth of blue-collar workers grew more quickly than those of the top 1%. Mortgage rates dropped to under 3%.\n\nFar from amassing dictatorial powers, Mr. Trump eschewed unconstitutional overreaches of executive authority. No \"I've got a pen and I've got a phone,\" the Trump administration worked through Congress and followed proper administrative procedures to achieve policy changes while undoing President Barack Obama's unconstitutional exercises of power by fiat. It was Mr. Biden, not Mr. Trump, who unilaterally attempted to cancel student debt, block mortgage foreclosures, hinder fossil fuel production, open the border, suppress free speech, impose a radical climate agenda, and de facto ban gasoline-powered cars and trucks.\n\nThe Trump presidency was the most peaceful since the Carter administration. Mr. Trump's opening wide the U.S. fossil fuel spigot reduced worldwide oil and natural gas prices and thereby weakened Russia. The Trump presidency was the only presidency in the last four in which Russia did not invade a neighbor. Mr. Trump's sending lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, something Mr. Obama refused to do, certainly aided Ukraine's resistance when Russia attacked -- after Mr. Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal debacle and \"minor incursion\" gaffe.\n\nMr. Trump was arguably the most pro-Israel president since Harry Truman, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and mediating the Abraham Accords. And the Trump administration sought to unwind terrible deals with Iran, which even now is using previously frozen U.S. dollars to support Russia in Ukraine, Hamas in Israel, and the Houthis as they attack U.S. and allied shipping. Mr. Trump recognized China as a major geopolitical threat.\n\nThe Trump administration depoliticized the Department of Justice and restored it as an evenhanded body that fairly promotes justice for all, regardless of political party. One need look no further than DOJ's refusal to claim the 2020 election had been materially affected by fraud and compare its activities to those of the Biden DOJ to see how apolitical the Trump DOJ was.\n\nThe Trump administration took on some of Washington's most intractable issues. It enacted the first major tax reform since 1986 and criminal justice reform. Mr. Trump took head-on immigration, albeit with limited success because of opposition in Congress. The U.S. did not have an open border under Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump nominated the first openly gay Cabinet secretary, Richard Grenell, whose nomination was blocked by Democrats in the Senate, and openly gay federal judges. Ever the fighter, Mr. Trump exposed the mainstream media as often untrustworthy purveyors of falsehoods and spin.\n\nCOVID-19 was unique in modern times. On the plus side, as the pandemic progressed, the Trump administration avoided a national panic, kept necessary services and products available, promoted a public-private partnership that produced vaccines years earlier than the \"experts\" said possible, and sought to protect religious liberty and other civil rights. Rather than becoming a dictator, Mr. Trump followed the Constitution by letting the states set local COVID-19 policy. On the negative side, Mr. Trump likely listened too much to the purported experts, and on his watch, the deep state and \"experts\" co-opted social media and suppressed free speech.\n\nSome fear that Mr. Trump will be a lawless president. What they largely fear is that Mr. Trump will do unto his political opponents what they have done unto him -- weaponizing law enforcement and administrative agencies to settle political scores. Most Americans rightly believe there are now two systems of justice -- one for the Trumps of the world and one for Washington elites such as Hillary Clinton and the Bidens. Perhaps Mr. Trump will seek revenge rather than turn the other cheek, but if his first term is a guide, he may instead again depoliticize the Department of Justice and return evenhanded justice to our country.\n\nThere are many critics willing to rail against Mr. Trump, so I need not repeat their arguments here. Certainly, Mr. Trump is often his own worst enemy.\n\nIn sum, when trying to divine what sort of second presidency a former president will have, a good starting point is to examine the presidency he already had. If Mr. Trump is elected this fall, it will be because a majority of voters think they were better off under Mr. Trump than under Mr. Biden -- and will be again.

Trials involving Trump's alleged 2020 election interference and illegal retention of national secrets loom.\n\nALSO READ: How Trump could run for president from jail\n\nAs the fraudster-in-chief and Benedict Arnold of our time, Trump continues to maintain his innocence and blames everybody but himself while attempting to make a mockery of the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nIn light of Trump's defiance, and the potential for more illegal Trumpian interference during the 2024 election, in which he is almost certain to be the Republican Party's nominee, now is a good time to go beyond Trump and explore the criminal culpability of Trump Crime Syndicate lieutenants and Trump's kitchen cabinet of MAGA knaves and rogues.\n\nThese are the people who have aided and abetted Trump, and continue to assist him in his single-minded quest to become the most powerful man in America.\n\nThey are worth your attention precisely because of the danger to democracy that they represent.\n\nAt the federal level, a gaggle of powerful Republican actors were deeply involved in the plot to overturn the 2020 election in Trump's favor. These include -- and are not limited to -- Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).\n\nAt the state level, dozens of Republican fake electors and Trump stakeholders have been criminally indicted in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada.\n\nAll of these criminal indictments for election interference like Trump's indictments are \"basically telling the same story of corruption and venality\" except for their \"different charges\" according to Kenneth F. McCallion, a former Special Attorney and Assistant U.S. Attorney with the DOJ who also worked for the New York attorney's general office as a prosecutor on Trump-related racketeering cases.\n\nALSO READ: Trump's Manhattan trial could determine whether rule of law survives: criminologist\n\nBut before proceeding further with this examination of presidential crime, politics and accountably, it is important to highlight Trump's unprecedented usage of the pardon power, which facilitated the failed coup of Jan. 6, 2021, as well as Republican electioneering of 2024.\n\nPrior to Trump, the presidential power of the pardon had always been about showing mercy and compassion. It was most certainly not a tool for rewarding criminal loyalty and weaponizing criminal conduct.\n\nExcluding Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime \"fixer\" and former \"partner in crime,\" the Boss pardoned several of his other loyal associates, especially those within the Trump Crime Syndicate.\n\nFor example, in relation to Russian election interference in 2016, Trump pardoned his former campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\nRevealed for the man he is in the 1992 Center for Public Integrity report The Torturers' Lobby, Manafort in 2019 was found guilty in the Eastern District of Virginia of two counts of bank fraud, five counts of tax fraud and one count of failing to disclose an offshore bank account.\n\nManafort also pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and to witness tampering in the federal District of Columbia. Most of these crimes were connected to his lobbying work in Ukraine.\n\nThen, just days before his longtime friend and campaign adviser Roger Stone's 48-month incarceration was scheduled to begin for seven felony convictions, including impeding a congressional inquiry, Trump commuted Stone's sentence.\n\nAnd when Trump was literally leaving the Oval Office and almost out the door, he granted clemency to his former chief political strategist Steve Bannon who had defrauded Trump donors out of more than $1 million to allegedly help build the border wall between the United States and Mexico.\n\nTrump also pardoned retired Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the only one-time White House official to be convicted as part of the Trump-Russian investigation carried out by special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nIn the cases of both Stone and Flynn, Trump's \"forgiveness\" cameafter Bill Barr, Trump's third of five attorneys general, failed to shut down these investigations on the spurious grounds that these two perpetrators, Stone and Flynn, had been the victims of witch hunts and overzealous prosecutors.\n\nALSO READ: Trump vs. history: Former presidents typically implode on their comeback tours\n\nWe have also known for nearly two years since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony before a House select committee that the pardon power does not prohibit preemptive pardons. Nine members of Trump's kitchen cabinet requested them in the wake of Jan. 6, demonstrating their full knowledge and intent of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, Manafort, Stone, Bannon, and Flynn are back supporting Trump's 2024 campaign as they did in 2016 and 2020. And, Trump and Putin are closer than ever. The Russian president has even publicly endorsed him this time round . It didn't hurt that Trump seemed to have Putin's back most, if not, all the time since he took office. Trump opposing NATO as well as Ukraine helped as well. Trump's pardoning his own men involved in the 2016 interference seemed to condone it. His illiberal authoritarian and anti-democratic credo was another plus.\n\nTrump's minions began their election interference in 2015 and never stopped\n\nLet's begin with the criminal prosecutions related to the 2016 Russian election interference investigated by Mueller.\n\nMueller's investigation led to the indictments of 34 individuals and three Russian companies. Five Trump associates and campaign officials were convicted of felonies including those mentioned above. Mueller's final report, while finding insufficient evidence of a Trump-Russian conspiracy, did conclude that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and expected to benefit from Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCohen and David Pecker are two of the key, among, many witnesses from Trump's inner circle testifying against their former Boss in the New York presidential election interference case.\n\nBy contrast, defendant Trump has no witnesses on his behalf. He also has no family or friends except son Eric who showed up in court on April 30 for the first time. Otherwise surrounded by only his attorneys who are devoid of any facts and some twisted law, maybe, if they are lucky.\n\nAnd through testimony on Friday the defense had scored no points during cross-examination that so far could create reasonable doubt.\n\nTurning next to a review of three of the 2020 Trump election interference cases I do so without concern with the consequences for or accountability of the fake electors because none of these individuals were either affiliated with the Trump Crime Syndicate or members of the former president's kitchen cabinet.\n\nAlthough a number of them were or are elected state officials and high-ranking members of the Republican presidential campaigns of 2020 as well as 2024.\n\nTo put Trump's minions in perspective, a brief examination of President Richard Nixon's henchmen is required.\n\nIn response to the criminal cover-up of the crimes involved in the attempted burglary of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972. Nixon was named as an \"unindicted co-conspirator\" on March 1, 1974, by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia. This was a wide conspiracy case that sent some of Washington's biggest names at the time to prison.\n\nCompared to Trump's failed coup, Nixon's Watergate break-in and cover-up was no big deal; it certainly was not an existential threat to democracy and the rule of law. There was no violence toward the Capitol or danger to members of Congress and the vice president.\n\nForty federal officials were indicted or jailed in the case. These included Nixon's highest-ranking officials such as the former Attorney General and chairman of his 1972 presidential campaign John Mitchell. Along with the disgraced Mitchell there was John Dean, White House legal counsel, John Ehrlichman and H.R. Halderman (White-House senior staff), Charles Colson, special counsel to the President, and James McCord, Security Director of CREEP. They were found guilty of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury in the January cover-up trial of 1975. All of these men carried out orders that, directly or indirectly, originated with Nixon himself.\n\nWhat stands out as a huge difference between the Watergate crimes responsible for forcing the resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency of the US and the Jan 6 insurrection was that Nixon became an unindicted co-conspirator while still in office. And he received his comeuppance after only a little over two years since the crimes occurred. At the time, Nixon had been president for the better part of six years.\n\nTrump after eight years of election interference and four years as president has yet to receive his criminal comeuppance. Even if he is convicted later this month on 34 felony counts in Manhattan, his appeals could delay his well-deserved imprisonment from occurring for at least another year or two.\n\nBy contrast, three years after Jan.6, and the violent assault on the Capitol building there have been 749 convicted and sentenced offenders. At least 467 rioters have been incarcerated in either jail or prison for an array of offenses including assaulting law enforcement officers, felonious obstructing, impeding, or interfering with a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder.\n\nMore than a dozen members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boy were convicted of the serious charges of seditious conspiracy. Additionally, 53 persons have been indicted as fake electors, many of whom have been high ranking Republican officials in the states of Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\nCompared to racketeering, Trump and company's very complex and organized election interference that included more than 2000 rioters besieging the Capitol on Jan. 6, and hundreds more working away in seven swing states including Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nParadoxically, it may seem strange given the reaction of the Republicans and the Department of Justice to Nixon and Watergate, that Trump and his election interference crimes have been given a free pass by the Supreme Court.\n\nWith respect to Trump's inner circles, a few have already pleaded guilty and many more will be held to account regardless of whether Trump is, although this is certainly a reflection on a man who boasted of surrounding himself with the \"best and brightest\" the nation has to offer.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

In the commonwealth, those tests showed Biden leading Trump 40% to 37% in a six-way race that included Kennedy at 8%. In a four-way race, Biden had a 42%-to-41% advantage over Trump. And Biden led Trump 48% to 44% in a head-to-head contest, according to NBC.\n\nAt a rally at the Greater Richmond Convention Center in March, Trump told attendees his campaign planned to \"make a big play for Virginia.\" But history hasn't been kind to the former president in the commonwealth.\n\nTrump lost to Sec. of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a margin of 212,030 votes. He lost again to President Joe Biden in 2020 by a margin of 451,138 votes - doubling the number of votes cast in opposition to Trump.\n\nThe last time a Republican won the presidential election in Virginia was in 2004, when former President George W. Bush beat Sec. of State John Kerry.\n\nVirginia is sometimes referred to as a harbinger for national politics, thanks to its off-year state-wide elections.\n\nIn November 2023 Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin was not on the ballot but control of the statehouse, and his ability to enact a conservative agenda, was. He hit the campaign trail to support Republicans seeking election to the State Senate and General Assembly. He floated a 15-week abortion ban as a compromise if Republicans were to gain control of the State Senate and maintain control of the House of Delegates.\n\nRepublicans lost the General Assembly and failed to gain control of the State Senate, and gaveDemocrats control of the state house.

A shortlist", "body": "Donald Trump has secured the necessary delegates to win the Republican presidential nomination for a third consecutive election. That result was never in much doubt, but the contest to be Trump's running mate is harder to predict. Once again, the Republican primaries demonstrated his strength among white men in rural areas, leading to speculation that he will choose a woman or person of colour to broaden his appeal in November.\n\nHere are some factors to consider and a look at the likely contenders.\n\nFormer vice-president Mike Pence was a useful ally during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, a Christian conservative who shored up support among Republicans suspicious of the thrice-married reality TV star. But Pence's refusal to comply with his boss's demand to overturn the 2020 election led to a falling out and made Pence a perceived traitor and target of the January 6 insurrectionists. After a failed bid for president in 2024, Pence recently said in an interview that he will not be endorsing Trump.\n\nHe may decide he needs a female running mate to make himself less toxic to suburban women, especially with abortion rights looming large as an election issue. But history suggests that he will have three priorities: a person who displays loyalty; a person who looks like they are from \"central casting\"; a person who knows their place and will not outshine him on the campaign trail.\n\nProbably not a lot. There is little evidence that a woman on the ticket draws more female voters or that a running mate's home state will necessarily back them. Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under President Barack Obama, told the New York Times: \"The vice-presidential pick is something that generates a massive amount of press coverage but has the most minimal of impacts on the election.\"\n\nBut perhaps a bad pick can do damage: Republican nominee John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin in 2008 probably didn't help. This year, however, Joe Biden and Donald Trump are, again, the two oldest candidates in history, giving new meaning to their VP picks being only \"a heartbeat away from the presidency\".\n\nRelated: Who is running for president in 2024? Biden, Trump and the full list of candidates\n\nFifteen. Eight of these succeeded to the office on the death of a president, including Lyndon Johnson, who was sworn in onboard Air Force One after the assassination of John F Kennedy. Gerald Ford was the only unelected vice-president and president following the resignations of Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon. Biden served as vice-president under Barack Obama, who was succeeded by Trump, who was then defeated by Biden for the presidency.\n\nThe Texas politician is a Trump loyalist and hardliner on border security who has fought a series of legal battles with the Biden White House. Trump said he \"would very much consider Abbott\" for vice-president during a joint Fox News interview in February. Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, said he was \"committed to governing Texas\" and to his own re-election campaign.\n\nOccupation: Conservative political commentator and writer\n\nThe former Fox News host is a strong ideological match. Like Trump, he relishes offending liberals, praising autocrats such as Vladimir Putin of Russia and Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary (he conducted fawning interviews with both) and pushing the far-right \"great replacement\" theory that western elites are importing immigrant voters to supplant white people. Although Carlson once wrote of Trump in a text message, \"I hate him passionately\", more recently he has praised him as \"sensible and wise\".\n\nBorn in Detroit to a single mother with a third- grade education who worked multiple jobs to support her family, Carson rose to become a leading neurosurgeon - a life story that the Trump campaign could promote as it seeks to win over aspirational Black votes. As housing secretary, Carson was among Trump's longest-serving cabinet members. He remained loyal to the outgoing president after the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol and campaigned with him in Iowa before the caucuses.\n\nDeSantis tried and failed to dethrone Trump as king of the Republican party, flaming out during the primary season. He once made a campaign ad in which he read Trump's book about getting rich, The Art of the Deal, to one of his children and encouraged them to \"build the wall\" along the US-Mexico border by stacking toy bricks. But when he ran for president, Trump branded him \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" and seems unlikely to forgive the perceived disloyalty.\n\nOccupation: Representative for Florida's 19th congressional district\n\nThe Freedom Caucus Republican is one of Trump's most prominent African American supporters and backed him against state governor Ron DeSantis in the primary election. He is short on experience, having only started in Congress in 2021. At an event hosted by Axios, Donalds suggested that he would be willing to decline to certify the 2028 election results if he were vice-president.\n\nThe former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate has rebranded herself as a rightwing media personality. She campaigned for election-denier Kari Lake and other Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections. Her provocative critiques of the western foreign policy establishment, and her overtures to dictators such as Putin and Syria's Bashar al-Assad, are likely to resonate with Trump. Asked in March by Fox News if she would consider a vice-presidential slot, Gabbard replied: \"I would be open to that.\"\n\nOccupation: Representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district\n\nThe far-right flamethrower from Georgia personifies the age of Trumpism with her pugnacious style, bizarre conspiracy theories, indications of support for political violence, and racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements. She once suggested that, if she had led the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, the mob would have been armed and victorious in its efforts to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 victory (she later claimed this was \"sarcasm\").\n\nThe former South Carolina governor was Trump's first ambassador to the United Nations and, as the daughter of Sikh immigrants from India, could help neutralise charges of sexism and racism against him. But her persistence as his most durable opponent during the Republican primary, in which she questioned his age and mental acuity, would be hard for Trump - who called her \"Birdbrain\" - and the Maga base to forgive. They are also at odds on aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe firebrand former TV anchor was the breakout Republican star of the midterm elections but lost the race for governor of Arizona, a result she has never accepted. She was endorsed by Trump and continued to repeat his election lies while campaigning as a surrogate for him during the Republican primary. But she may be seen as more valuable running for Senate because she could help Republicans take control of that chamber if she wins.\n\nThe former pageant queen and congresswoman, serving her second term as South Dakota's governor, gained national attention after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic. But she scored a spectacular own goal by admitting in a new memoir that she shot dead her dog, a 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket, after it killed her neighbour's chickens. The book also included a false claim that she once met the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which Noem has promised to correct in later editions. Her conservative stance on abortion - and media reports of an affair with the former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski - could be a further electoral liability.\n\nThe former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination is a political neophyte who shook up the Republican primary debates, acting as unofficial Trump surrogate and earning the scorn of Haley. Trump condemned Ramaswamy as \"not Maga\" when he gained traction in the opinion polls but has since praised the biotech entrepreneur, who dropped out and threw his weight behind the former president. Ramaswamy is a young person of colour, although his views on the climate crisis are out of step with young voters.\n\nThe former Florida state house speaker was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after stressing his working-class background and \"American dream\" story as the son of Cuban immigrants who worked as a bartender and hotel maid. Rubio ran for president in 2016, winning the Minnesota primary before dropping out of the race eventually won by Trump, who branded him \"Little Marco\". But in the years since then he has become a case study in the Republican party's capitulation to Trump, endorsing him for president in January 2024.\n\nShe was a devoted White House press secretary, tirelessly promoting Trump's agenda and insisting that he was neither racist nor sexist. Last year she was inaugurated as the first woman to serve as governor of Arkansas and she is currently the youngest governor in the country. Her father, former governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, is the creator of The Kids Guide to President Trump and an ex-pastor who might help shore up the Christian evangelical vote.\n\nThe Black evangelical Christian made his own bid for the presidency but dropped out two months before the Iowa caucuses, endorsing Trump and telling him: \"I just love you.\" The senator might be seen as a way to build on Trump's recent progress among male African American voters. Asked about potential running mates during a Fox News town hall in February, Trump pointed to Scott and said: \"A lot of people are talking about that gentleman right over there.\" Scott is single but, with impeccable timing, recently presented his girlfriend with an engagement ring.\n\nOccupation: Representative for New York's 21st congressional district\n\nThe New York politician is the highest-ranking woman in the Republican conference in the House of Representatives and one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump. Once a moderate, she gained national prominence last year after embarrassing the heads of three top universities about antisemitism on their campuses during a congressional hearing, which prompted two of them to later resign. She has also parroted Trump's use of the term \"hostages\" to describe those convicted of crimes on January 6.\n\nThe venture capitalist rose to prominence with his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.

The Democratic incumbent's support isn't nearly that high now.\n\nIn fact, FiveThirtyEight's model puts Biden's approval rating at roughly 39%, which is enough to send plenty in his party reaching for antacids. It'd be a mistake to assume that the president's re-election prospects are doomed -- FiveThirtyEight's model also shows Biden running neck-in-neck with the presumptive Republican nominee -- but the data clearly suggests the incumbent has some work to do.\n\nBut that's not all the data suggests.\n\nGiven that Biden won with 51% support, and now has an approval rating below 40%, there are clearly constituencies that supported the Democrat before, but who are not altogether pleased now. It stands to reason that some of these voters might even be willing to give Donald Trump a second look, given the dissatisfaction with the status quo.\n\nWhat's amazing is how eager the former president is to alienate many of those same voters.\n\nWhile many Muslim-American voters have been deeply critical of Biden, Trump isn't exactly rolling out the welcome mat. The Republican has endorsed Israel's military offensive in Gaza, announced plans to expand his Muslim ban, condemned pro-Palestinian protests, and rejected the idea of bringing Gaza residents to the United States as refugees.\n\nWhile polls suggest Black voters might be open to a Biden alternative, Team Trump said it intends to focus on \"anti-white racism\" rather than discrimination against people of color. The former president himself recently complained, \"I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and that can't be allowed, adding, \"[T]here's absolutely a bias against white.\"\n\nWhile polls suggest Latino voters might be open to a Biden alternative, Trump has spent recent months condemning migrants from Latin American countries by echoing Hitler and making comments such as, \"They're not humans, they're animals.\" The Republican is also planning to embrace militarized mass deportations and detention camps in a possible second term.\n\nWhile polls suggest young voters might be open to a Biden alternative, Trump and his allies have fought tooth and nail to oppose the White House's efforts to address student loan debt relief. Trump also plans to be even worse on the climate crisis than he was in his first term, which tends to be the opposite of what most young voters are looking for in a candidate.\n\nAs for working-class voters concerned about their expenses, Trump has made painfully clear that he doesn't understand basics of inflation, and he has an unambiguous plan to make inflation worse.\n\nIf Biden is fortunate, his likely GOP rival will continue to spend the next several months alienating, insulting, and offending the voters who might've voted Democratic four years ago, but who are open to something different in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score":

He spent five decades in New York and beyond avoiding charges and prosecutions for sexual harassment, tax evasion, money laundering and nonpayment of employees.\n\nIf this wasn't enough, Trump also busied himself by allegedly defrauding tenants, customers, contractors, investors, bankers, attorneys, students and charities, not to mention making use of undocumented workers.\n\nIn retrospect, Trump's lifetime of lies and lawlessness appear to have prepared him for the fateful moment in which he now finds himself -- in a court of law, answering for the first 34 of 88 felony counts that stem from alleged crimes he committed immediately before, during and after his presidency. Trials involving Trump's alleged 2020 election interference and illegal retention of national secrets loom.\n\nALSO READ: How Trump could run for president from jail\n\nAs the fraudster-in-chief and Benedict Arnold of our time, Trump continues to maintain his innocence and blames everybody but himself while attempting to make a mockery of the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nIn light of Trump's defiance, and the potential for more illegal Trumpian interference during the 2024 election, in which he is almost certain to be the Republican Party's nominee, now is a good time to go beyond Trump and explore the criminal culpability of Trump Crime Syndicate lieutenants and Trump's kitchen cabinet of MAGA knaves and rogues.\n\nThese are the people who have aided and abetted Trump, and continue to assist him in his single-minded quest to become the most powerful man in America.\n\nThey are worth your attention precisely because of the danger to democracy that they represent.\n\nAt the federal level, a gaggle of powerful Republican actors were deeply involved in the plot to overturn the 2020 election in Trump's favor. These include -- and are not limited to -- Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).\n\nAt the state level, dozens of Republican fake electors and Trump stakeholders have been criminally indicted in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada.\n\nAll of these criminal indictments for election interference like Trump's indictments are \"basically telling the same story of corruption and venality\" except for their \"different charges\" according to Kenneth F. McCallion, a former Special Attorney and Assistant U.S. Attorney with the DOJ who also worked for the New York attorney's general office as a prosecutor on Trump-related racketeering cases.\n\nALSO READ: Trump's Manhattan trial could determine whether rule of law survives: criminologist\n\nBut before proceeding further with this examination of presidential crime, politics and accountably, it is important to highlight Trump's unprecedented usage of the pardon power, which facilitated the failed coup of Jan. 6, 2021, as well as Republican electioneering of 2024.\n\nPrior to Trump, the presidential power of the pardon had always been about showing mercy and compassion. It was most certainly not a tool for rewarding criminal loyalty and weaponizing criminal conduct.\n\nExcluding Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime \"fixer\" and former \"partner in crime,\" the Boss pardoned several of his other loyal associates, especially those within the Trump Crime Syndicate.\n\nFor example, in relation to Russian election interference in 2016, Trump pardoned his former campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\nRevealed for the man he is in the 1992 Center for Public Integrity report The Torturers' Lobby, Manafort in 2019 was found guilty in the Eastern District of Virginia of two counts of bank fraud, five counts of tax fraud and one count of failing to disclose an offshore bank account.\n\nManafort also pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and to witness tampering in the federal District of Columbia. Most of these crimes were connected to his lobbying work in Ukraine.\n\nThen, just days before his longtime friend and campaign adviser Roger Stone's 48-month incarceration was scheduled to begin for seven felony convictions, including impeding a congressional inquiry, Trump commuted Stone's sentence.\n\nAnd when Trump was literally leaving the Oval Office and almost out the door, he granted clemency to his former chief political strategist Steve Bannon who had defrauded Trump donors out of more than $1 million to allegedly help build the border wall between the United States and Mexico.\n\nTrump also pardoned retired Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the only one-time White House official to be convicted as part of the Trump-Russian investigation carried out by special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nIn the cases of both Stone and Flynn, Trump's \"forgiveness\" cameafter Bill Barr, Trump's third of five attorneys general, failed to shut down these investigations on the spurious grounds that these two perpetrators, Stone and Flynn, had been the victims of witch hunts and overzealous prosecutors.\n\nALSO READ: Trump vs. history: Former presidents typically implode on their comeback tours\n\nWe have also known for nearly two years since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony before a House select committee that the pardon power does not prohibit preemptive pardons. Nine members of Trump's kitchen cabinet requested them in the wake of Jan. 6, demonstrating their full knowledge and intent of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, Manafort, Stone, Bannon, and Flynn are back supporting Trump's 2024 campaign as they did in 2016 and 2020. And, Trump and Putin are closer than ever. The Russian president has even publicly endorsed him this time round . It didn't hurt that Trump seemed to have Putin's back most, if not, all the time since he took office. Trump opposing NATO as well as Ukraine helped as well. Trump's pardoning his own men involved in the 2016 interference seemed to condone it. His illiberal authoritarian and anti-democratic credo was another plus.\n\nTrump's minions began their election interference in 2015 and never stopped\n\nLet's begin with the criminal prosecutions related to the 2016 Russian election interference investigated by Mueller.\n\nMueller's investigation led to the indictments of 34 individuals and three Russian companies. Five Trump associates and campaign officials were convicted of felonies including those mentioned above. Mueller's final report, while finding insufficient evidence of a Trump-Russian conspiracy, did conclude that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and expected to benefit from Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCohen and David Pecker are two of the key, among, many witnesses from Trump's inner circle testifying against their former Boss in the New York presidential election interference case.\n\nBy contrast, defendant Trump has no witnesses on his behalf. He also has no family or friends except son Eric who showed up in court on April 30 for the first time. Otherwise surrounded by only his attorneys who are devoid of any facts and some twisted law, maybe, if they are lucky.\n\nAnd through testimony on Friday the defense had scored no points during cross-examination that so far could create reasonable doubt.\n\nTurning next to a review of three of the 2020 Trump election interference cases I do so without concern with the consequences for or accountability of the fake electors because none of these individuals were either affiliated with the Trump Crime Syndicate or members of the former president's kitchen cabinet.\n\nAlthough a number of them were or are elected state officials and high-ranking members of the Republican presidential campaigns of 2020 as well as 2024.\n\nTo put Trump's minions in perspective, a brief examination of President Richard Nixon's henchmen is required.\n\nIn response to the criminal cover-up of the crimes involved in the attempted burglary of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972. Nixon was named as an \"unindicted co-conspirator\" on March 1, 1974, by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia. This was a wide conspiracy case that sent some of Washington's biggest names at the time to prison.\n\nCompared to Trump's failed coup, Nixon's Watergate break-in and cover-up was no big deal; it certainly was not an existential threat to democracy and the rule of law. There was no violence toward the Capitol or danger to members of Congress and the vice president.\n\nForty federal officials were indicted or jailed in the case. These included Nixon's highest-ranking officials such as the former Attorney General and chairman of his 1972 presidential campaign John Mitchell. Along with the disgraced Mitchell there was John Dean, White House legal counsel, John Ehrlichman and H.R. Halderman (White-House senior staff), Charles Colson, special counsel to the President, and James McCord, Security Director of CREEP. They were found guilty of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury in the January cover-up trial of 1975. All of these men carried out orders that, directly or indirectly, originated with Nixon himself.\n\nWhat stands out as a huge difference between the Watergate crimes responsible for forcing the resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency of the US and the Jan 6 insurrection was that Nixon became an unindicted co-conspirator while still in office. And he received his comeuppance after only a little over two years since the crimes occurred. At the time, Nixon had been president for the better part of six years.\n\nTrump after eight years of election interference and four years as president has yet to receive his criminal comeuppance. Even if he is convicted later this month on 34 felony counts in Manhattan, his appeals could delay his well-deserved imprisonment from occurring for at least another year or two.\n\nBy contrast, three years after Jan.6, and the violent assault on the Capitol building there have been 749 convicted and sentenced offenders. At least 467 rioters have been incarcerated in either jail or prison for an array of offenses including assaulting law enforcement officers, felonious obstructing, impeding, or interfering with a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder.\n\nMore than a dozen members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boy were convicted of the serious charges of seditious conspiracy. Additionally, 53 persons have been indicted as fake electors, many of whom have been high ranking Republican officials in the states of Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\nCompared to racketeering, Trump and company's very complex and organized election interference that included more than 2000 rioters besieging the Capitol on Jan. 6, and hundreds more working away in seven swing states including Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nParadoxically, it may seem strange given the reaction of the Republicans and the Department of Justice to Nixon and Watergate, that Trump and his election interference crimes have been given a free pass by the Supreme Court.\n\nWith respect to Trump's inner circles, a few have already pleaded guilty and many more will be held to account regardless of whether Trump is, although this is certainly a reflection on a man who boasted of surrounding himself with the \"best and brightest\" the nation has to offer.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Or Is She Reaping What She Sowed? By Maria Grant", "body": "I've been thinking about what it must be like to be Melania Trump these days. Just imagine day after day hearing about your husband's tawdry affairs with a Playboy playmate and an adult film star. And then listening to the excruciating details about hush money payments and other financial transactions. And if that isn't bad enough, you must once again read Trump's words recorded on the Access Hollywood tape, where he explains just what you can do to women when you're a star.\n\nFrankly, I have a tough time understanding why any woman in America would cast a vote for Donald Trump. Here are 10 reasons why.\n\nOne. He has cheated on each of his three wives. Clearly, he doesn't understand the concept of being true to another person or taking a vow and keeping your word. Trump married Melania in 2005. His trysts with both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels occurred in 2006 -- the same year Baron Trump was born. Nice.\n\nTwo. Trump has called women horrible names over the past few decades, confirming he has no regard or respect for women. These names include Horseface, Pocahontas, a crazed lying lowlife, Dog, Nasty, Bimbo, Big Fat Pig -- to name a few. You get the idea.\n\nThree. Immigration. Trump's immigration policies separated children from their parents which resulted in many traumatic situations and, in some cases, irreparable damage.\n\nFour. Trump loaded the courts -- including the Supreme Court -- with ultra-conservative judges who believe they have the right to control women's reproductive options.\n\nFive. Trump has frequently talked about the sex appeal of his daughter Ivanka which is plain creepy. And those photos of Trump and Epstein mingling and laughing at parties make my skin crawl. And then there are the reports that he often walked backstage when he owned the Miss Universe Beauty Pageant, leering at women as they got dressed.\n\nSix. Trump thinks turning abortion regulations over to the states is \"working brilliantly.\" Just last week, there have been several life-threatening situations where pregnant women could not get the healthcare they needed. Some mothers died. In another case last week, a baby died in the back seat of a car because a mother was not permitted access to appropriate healthcare.\n\nSeven. Trump wants to relax already permissive gun regulations. Both children and adults will be in increased danger given the already unrestrictive gun legislation.\n\nEight. Trump doesn't believe in climate change. That means the earth -- the environment in general -- will suffer. Trump has shown no interest or commitment in passing legislation to address this catastrophic situation. Most women I know feel strongly about leaving the world a better place for future generations.\n\nNine. Trump objectifies women. He frequently selects women for various positions not because of their education, experience, and credentials but to surround himself with \"eye candy.\" A case in point: Puppy-killing Kristi Noem, governor of South Dakota, is on Trump's short list for Vice President. Many speculate this is not because of her experience, but rather because he likes the way she looks. And who can forget the disrespectful way Trump stood behind Hillary during the 2016 presidential debates? To intimidate her, he stalked her.\n\nTen. Trump lies. At least 26 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. He has denied every allegation. A New York judge found Trump guilty of sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll. The New York hush money case has already shown proof that he has lied about both the affairs and the hush money transactions.\n\nBack to Melania, I have never been a fan. I thought her \"Be Best\" campaign was ill-conceived and went nowhere. She often seemed disinterested and aloof as First Lady. Remember her \"I Really Don't Care Do You\" jacket? What was that about? I found it offensive, particularly when you consider she wore it to meet migrant children at the border who were separated from their parents.

The candidate was not Mitt Romney, who probably couldn't get nominated to be a banana salesman in a monkey whorehouse by the national Republican electorate at this point.\n\nNo, this time the nominee was Donald Trump. And while writing off 40 percent of Democratic voters as automatons being bought with government funds, and while such comments are so far down the list of contemptible Trumpian statements that they will never register the way Romney's did, and while ... wait a minute, we forgot where we were going with this.\n\nTrump made the remarks during a closed-door fundraising luncheon at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, and recordings were promptly leaked to The Washington Post by a \"Republican donor.\" They were also \"obtained\" by The New York Times, which, considering Maggie Haberman's byline is on the story, means the audio could have come directly from Trump, or someone in his camp who was confident they would get reported out with zero backlash. And frankly, why wouldn't Trump be confident of such a result?\n\n\"When you are Democrat, you start off essentially at 40 percent because you have civil service, you have the unions and you have welfare,\" Trump said. \"They get welfare to vote and then they cheat on top of that. They cheat.\"\n\nThis is unfair. The Republicans have the police unions! And the cops will bust some hippie heads without even being asked. Can Joe Biden say the same about, say, the Writers Guild of America?\n\nWell, at least Republicans have made inroads with the welfare moochers since 2012. Look at what Mitt Romney was up against with that gigantic 47 percent! If Trump can't win when the Democrats have only 40 percent of the moochers locked up, he'll be an even bigger loser than the senator from Utah.\n\nTrump also reportedly accused Joe Biden of running \"a Gestapo administration,\" which, yes, sure, if there is anything Donald Trump has to fear, it is the Gestapo showing up at his house in the middle of the night and dragging him off to be tortured in a basement somewhere. He also called Special Counsel Jack Smith \"unattractive\" and a \"fucking asshole.\" And those are probably the mildest epithets he has thrown out about Smith in the last couple of years.\n\nTrump devoted parts of his tirade to complaining about election fraud in 2020 (natch) and bragging about all the golf tournaments he has been winning at his own clubs. Maybe we could get him to drop out in exchange for a permanent spot on the PGA Seniors Tour?\n\nSome more color from the Post:\n\nAt another point, he complained about having to take so many pictures with donors and told people in the crowd that if they didn't get a picture, it was because they didn't give enough money. He also claimed that a wedding at the property got preference over the donors because the wedding was paying more per person to be there.\n\nFour hundred people paid a minimum of $40,000 apiece to attend this luncheon, though in Trump's defense, that probably only covered his legal bills for Monday. Proving once again that rich people are huge suckers. They paid forty grand a pop to sit through the same rambling, formless monologue they could have heard at one of his campaign rallies for free.\n\nTrump also blamed abortion for the narrow margin the Republicans enjoy in the House of Representatives, saying that the GOP would have had 45 more seats if not for all those Jezebels infuriated about that whole losing their bodily autonomy thing. He and his team also seem to think -- or are pretending to think -- they can expand his electoral map, including winning Virginia, which he lost to Biden by 10 points in 2020.\n\nHillary Clinton idly mused about expanding the Democrats' map in 2016 in an interview once. Would anyone like to ask Trump how that went for her?\n\nFinally we would be remiss if we did not congratulate Rep. Henry Cuellar for the singular achievement of being a Democrat who has earned Trump's sympathy for something, even if that sympathy was in service of Cuellar's being an (alleged) degenerate criminal who took $600,000 in bribes over a decade from a Mexican bank and an Azerbaijani gas company:\n\nHe lamented the bribery charges lodged against Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), suggesting that he \"got indicted for political reasons, because he was tough on the border.\"", "source": {"uri": "wonkette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonkette"},

Had he lost those votes he would have been in a tie with Trump in electoral votes -- that's how close the race was four years ago and likely how close it could be again this year.\n\nFew think New York will be up for grabs in this year's election, but some New Yorkers are working to help either Biden or Trump by reaching out to voters in swing states or with contributions to the campaign committees and super PACs to run ads there.\n\nOn Friday, Trump invited outside groups supporting him, including Heritage Action and Turning Point Action, to Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss working together, followed by a three-day retreat for top donors, according to Politico.\n\nMeanwhile, groups aligned with Democrats aim to bolster turnout for Biden. Swing Left, for example, a national group with chapters in New York City and on Long Island, spends funds and recruits volunteers to build support for Democratic candidates.\n\nLeslie Pascaud, a chief marketing officer for a digital medical trials company who splits her time between Shelter Island and New York City, told Newsday Swing Left volunteers write and make phone calls to voters selected through research of voting records.\n\nAdrianne Davis, a Copiague political activist working with Swing Left, said she plans to travel to Pennsylvania or another swing state this year to knock on doors to talk to voters and encourage them to vote for Biden and other Democrats.\n\n\"This is a really smart to target battlegrounds to make a difference where differences could be made,\" Davis told Newsday.\n\nNew Yorkers also help pay the enormous tab of political advertising to back Trump or Biden in swing states. New York is the second-largest source of donations to Biden's campaign with $19.1 million in the last 15 months and the fourth-largest to Trump's with $4.1 million, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks political money.\n\nDuring the past two weeks, the Biden campaign spent $6.3 million on advertising, including $1.4 million on digital ads, according to AdImpact, a company that tracks advertising placements. The Biden Victory Fund spent an additional $526,000 on digital ads.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not pay for ads, but MAGA Inc., the super PAC backing Trump, spent $2.9 million on ads and the Trump National Committee Joint Fundraising Committee spent $535,000 on digital ads, AdImpact said.\n\nAdImpact projects presidential general election spending for the 2024 election will rise to $2.1 billion, and that three quarters of that amount will focus on the seven swing states.\n\nThe Democratic-aligned Future Forward PAC already has placed $130.2 million in ad reservations in those states from August through Election Day, AdImpact said.\n\nAs in every election, turnout of supporters is the key to winning.\n\nDavid Schultz, a professor of political science at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota and editor of \"Presidential Swing States,\" a collection of academic articles, told Newsday he sees a narrower battlefield this year than in 2020 for Biden and Trump.\n\n\"I think the race comes down to 5% of the voters in five counties in five states that will decide the election,\" he said.\n\nSchultz's picks: Maricopa County, Arizona, home of Phoenix; Fulton County, Georgia, with Atlanta; Wayne County, Michigan, with Detroit; Alleghany County, Pennsylvania, with Pittsburgh; and Brown County, Wisconsin, with Green Bay or Door County to the northeast.\n\nIf turnout for Biden by women, people of color and voters under 30 in these counties is weak, Trump wins, Schultz said.\n\nLawrence Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University, told Newsday he is focused on suburban counties in the seven swing states. Biden long has relied on suburban votes, Levy said.\n\n\"Of course, recreating his urban-suburban coalition isn't going to be easy for Biden, given the blame he's received for a bipartisan immigration mess, the intraparty feuding over the Israel-Hamas war, the leakage of previously loyal Latino voters and denial that the economy is soaring,\" Levy said in a CNN opinion piece last week.\n\n\"Biden needs the suburbs to save his political life,\" Levy said.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is not organic and it's not accidental,\" he says.\n\n\"The far left is abusing our free society and arguing for a system that ultimately is repressive and hasn't worked as they imagine anywhere in the world. In fact, in the name of socialism and communism, tens of millions have been murdered, many others incarcerated, not to mention freedom and liberty lost,\" Mr. Anuzis continues.\n\n\"This is a problem. Elections have consequences. Every Democrat in Congress has voted to empower these radicals. Liberal prosecutors and judges are encouraging this activity by ignoring the rule of law. Pay attention folks -- these problems are coming to a neighborhood near you,\" he concludes.\n\nThe commentary was published Sunday at SaulsNews.com, a news site which Mr. Anuzis both contributes to and curates.\n\nAN UNEXPECTED BACKFIRE\n\nFox News anchor Maria Bartiromo had a question for Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump. Former President Donald Trump continues his appearances in a New York City courtroom -- but has still managed to make campaign stops such as a recent visit to a New York City firehouse, where he delivered pizzas to local firefighters.\n\n\"How are you raising money and putting President Trump in front of donors if he's got to be in New York all day long?\" Ms. Bartiromo asked her guest.\n\n\"Well, obviously, Maria, that's by design. They want to keep Donald Trump trapped in a courtroom and not able to go out and campaign. And their hope is that, somehow, that helps Joe Biden. But it's amazing to see,\" Mrs. Trump said.\n\n\"It's almost like Sylvester the Cat and Tweety Bird. When Sylvester goes hard after Tweety Bird, it always backfires. And that's exactly what's happening to the Democrats right now, because you see, as you pointed out, Donald Trump's poll numbers continuing to go up,\" she continued.\n\n\"At the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign, we announced that our April fund-raising exceeded our expectations. We raised $76 million. And the beauty of that is, the average donation, Maria, is under $30. That means the people of this country understand what's at stake. They understand what is happening to this man, this lawfare that is being waged against him in an attempt to interfere in an election,\" Mrs. Trump said.\n\n\"And they are fighting back. Even in the midst of this abysmal economy that Joe Biden has handed us, people are donating their money at DonaldJTrump.com, if anybody wants to support us, because they understand what is at stake right now,\" she said.\n\nMrs. Trump also recommended that GOP voters visit two websites -- DonaldJTrump.com and ProtectTheVote.com.\n\nTHE BIG SPRING MEETING\n\nThe big event took place on a \"picture-perfect Palm Beach Saturday, in the Grand Ballroom of the Mar-a-Lago Club.\"\n\nThat event was the Republican National Committee Spring Meeting which featured a \"raucous standing ovation\" for former President Donald Trump and some spirited speeches celebrating committee fundraising, the \"America First Agenda,\" and the \"MAGA Movement.\"\n\n\"President Trump closed the event by thanking Republican leaders and donors, and raising an additional $2 million right from the podium at the event,\" the committee said in a statement.\n\n\"The American people are fed up with weak Joe Biden's failed economy, border crisis, and unacceptable responses to antisemitic violence spreading across college campuses nationwide. Our team will continue working every day to exceed expectations, raise the funds we need, and build an unmatched party infrastructure to prove that President Trump's momentum is unstoppable,\" said RNC Chair Michael Whatley and Co-Chair Lara Trump in a written statement.\n\nA GROWING INTEREST\n\nThe grand Burpee seed and garden catalogue was established by W. Atlee Burpee in 1876 and continues to offer a near astonishing variety of garden goodies and supplies.\n\nTheir newest offerings include a \"Supreme Sweet\" red pepper, Mayan Sunset petunias, \"Boomerang Purpink\" lilacs, \"Red Hybrid\" Sunflowers and \"Butterbaby\" winter squash -- along with tools, composters, vintage-style posters, wildflowers and much more.\n\n* 88% of U.S. adults say the economy is \"very important\" in determining who they will vote for U.S. president in the November election.\n\n* 85% cite inflation and rising prices as very important in determining their vote.\n\n* 77% cite crime and safety, 76% cite health care.\n\n* 69% cite the immigration situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSOURCE: An ABC/Ipsos poll of 2,260 U.S. adults conducted online April

The new survey provides a road map of the persuadables most open to appeals in a campaign being shaped by sharp divides on abortion and immigration as well as an unprecedented criminal trial of a former president, now underway in New York.\n\nWhat's more, 8% are now supporting independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and an additional 5% backing other third-party contenders. Most of their supporters acknowledge they might switch their allegiances before they cast a ballot.\n\nTiffany Batton, 43, an independent from Chicago who was among those surveyed, plans to vote for Biden. \"He inherited a lot of problems from the last administration,\" the social worker said in a follow-up phone interview. \"I feel like, if given a chance, he could fulfill some of those campaign promises if he had another four years.\"\n\nBut she might change her mind, depending on what happens in the Mideast and elsewhere. \"The war in Israel has been weighing really heavy on me,\" she said.\n\nBrett Watchom, 36, a shipping clerk from Denver who is also an independent, backs Kennedy, attracted by his position on housing and because he is \"the only one not part of the horrible uni-party machine.\"\n\nHe allowed that he might switch his support \"if the Libertarian candidate turns out to be better.\"\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe candidates have limited time ahead to make their case.\n\n\"When we think about the race tied with just 26 weeks to go, we have to consider that people tune out politics and the party conventions in July and August,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"That leaves just 17 weeks for candidates to actively campaign, and it's actually 13 or 14 weeks when you consider states where early voting starts weeks before Election Day.\n\n\"We're basically at the doorstep of the election, and the outcome is a coin flip.\"\n\nThe new poll shows Biden's standing against Trump improving inch-by-inch, albeit within the survey's margin of error.\n\nIn the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll taken in January, Biden trailed Trump by 3 points - 34%-37% - and in March he trailed by 2, at 38%-40%. Now they're even.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, Biden has gained ground among some key voters while Trump has lost it.\n\nThe White House has recently announced policy decisions and aired political ads that have particular appeal to some younger swing voters, including moving to ease federal regulation of marijuana and relieve some college student debt. This month, Biden is slated to deliver the commencement address at Morehouse College, an historically Black school.\n\nThe strength of the third-party candidates may be built on sand.\n\nEight in 10 of those supporting Kennedy say they might change their minds before they vote. So do 88% of those supporting independent Cornel West, 65% of those who plan to support the Libertarian nominee, and 58% backing Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nTypically the support for third-party candidates declines as Election Day nears, although in close elections the impact of drawing only thousands of voters in swing states can tip the election outcome.\n\nIn 2016, the Green Party candidate took votes from Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, crucial states she ended up losing. In 2020, the Libertarian candidate drew voters from Trump in Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, critical states he lost.\n\n\"I'm leaning towards Joe Biden, and I'll tell you why: I look at his record on the economy,\" said Al Wilson, 56, an independent from Shelby, Michigan, who works as the production manager for an auto manufacturer. He credits the president with restoring the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also cites Biden's presidential \"deportment,\" implicitly contrasting it with Trump. \"We need leadership that is not (in) the news cycle all the time,\" he said. \"I get sick of that. I don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear controversy. I don't want you involved in controversy all the time.\"\n\nOther swing voters also say they might change their minds before November, including 43% of independents. Nearly half of independent women, 47%, are open to persuasion, one reason the Biden campaign has focused so intently on abortion access as an issue.\n\nSome groups that Democrats rely on in national elections say their minds aren't firmly made up. That includes 37% of Hispanic voters, 27% of Black voters and 44% of voters under 35.\n\nMore than two-thirds of those surveyed (69%) say the country is \"on the wrong track;\" fewer than 1 in 4 (23%) say it is \"headed in the right direction.\" That's a tick less positive than the nation's mood in the March survey.\n\n\"I haven't made up my mind yet,\" said Emily Weller, 39, a Republican from Indianapolis. \"I would not vote for former President Trump; I don't think that I would vote for President Biden,\" the stay-at-home mom said. \"My vote matters to me and I want to vote, but it's not cut-and-dried.\"\n\nThen there are those voters definitely not in play.\n\nThose now supporting Biden say by 84%-14% that their minds are firmly made up. Trump supporters are set by a similarly wide 83%-16%.\n\n\"Everything was better under Trump,\" declared Mike McCombs, 67, a Republican and an independent insurance agent from Lincolnton, Georgia. \"The economy was better. Fuel prices were better. Biden has choked the middle class to death.\"\n\nA conviction of Trump in his current trial, on charges relating to paying hush money to a porn star, wouldn't change his view. \"It would probably make me support him more because this is a rigged trial anyway,\" he said.\n\nBoth major-party candidates have solidified their standing among their partisans. Now 87% of Democrats back Biden, up 7 points since January; 84% of Republicans back Trump, up 5 points.\n\nA negligible 2% of Democrats and 1% of Republicans are crossing the aisle to support the other major party's presumptive nominee.\n\n\"I liked the way he ran the country when he was president the first time,\" said Stephen Harrison, 52, a small-business owner and Trump supporter from Manhattan, Montana. \"The economy is No. 1. He did a good job of keeping things running and open best he could during the pandemic.\n\n\"The only thing that would change my mind is if he isn't on the ballot,\" he said.\n\nFrancis Spitale, 60, a Democrat from Charleston, South Carolina, who cares for newborns, says her support for Biden is unshakable.\n\n\"Are all the policies perfect?\" she asked. \"No. But I respect him as a good, decent human being who has been able to accomplish more in two or three years than a lot of other presidents have been able to.\"\n\nShe dismissed those who say Biden, at 81, is too old to serve another term.\n\n\"No one's saying the (Rolling) Stones are too old to have a concert; Bruce Springsteen is out there at 73,\" she said. \"If you are a productive person, you don't have to be skateboarding and skiing down the slopes to be effective.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

It always depends on the fairness of an election.\"\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results,\" he later told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nWhen Trump says \"it depends,\" here's the problem: He has never competed in an election that he acknowledged as fair.\n\nEven when he won the presidential election of 2016, he claimed that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats rigged the count to deny him a popular-vote landslide, contending without evidence that millions of noncitizens had voted in California. The official inquiry he ordered up found no significant irregularities.\n\nIn 2020, when he lost to President Biden by 7 million votes, Trump not only claimed the result was illegitimate; he worked for months to overturn it, demanding that state officials \"find\" thousands of new votes in his favor. When his court challenges failed, he summoned supporters to Washington and urged them to march on the Capitol.\n\n\"If you don't fight like hell, you won't have a country any more,\" he told them. The mob responded by invading the building.\n\nHe returned to that apocalyptic theme last week, when he told supporters in Wisconsin that if Biden wins a second term, \"we won't have a country left.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is destroying our country,\" Trump said at a rally. \"The enemy from within is more dangerous than China and Russia. ... I actually think our country is not going to survive.\"\n\nIt was as if he was priming his followers for extreme measures if he doesn't prevail.\n\nAnd it was part of a long pattern. In January, he warned that if his four criminal indictments prevent him from winning, the result will be \"bedlam in the country.\"\n\n\"It's the opening of a Pandora's box,\" he warned.\n\nIn March, he posted a video on his social media account showing an image of Biden hog-tied like a prisoner.\n\nAnd for months he has extolled the defendants convicted of violent crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection as \"hostages,\" promising to pardon many or all if he is reelected.\n\n\"He's telling us what his intentions are, as he did before Jan. 6,\" Juliette Kayyem, a terrorism expert at Harvard University, said recently on PBS. \"The language is the language of incitement. ... If he loses, we certainly know from what Trump has said -- and we also know from what the FBI is telling us -- that there are large groups and organizations that are preparing to continue the fight.\"\n\nAs matters stand in the presidential campaign, that kind of 2020-style crisis may not recur, since Trump stands a good chance of winning.\n\nThe average of public opinion polls published by fivethirtyeight.com shows a dead heat in the national popular vote -- but it shows Trump winning in all six of the most important swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump used a day off from his New York criminal trial Wednesday to campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, where he returned to his warnings about an unfair election process.\n\n\"The radical-left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020,\" he claimed untruthfully yet again. \"We're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. We won't have a country left ... 2024 is our final battle.\"\n\nFor months, Biden has sought to remind voters that Trump, if reelected, would run roughshod over the norms of American government and politics.\n\n\"Democracy is on the ballot,\" the president often says.\n\nBy reminding voters that he doesn't accept the duty to recognize the result of an election he loses, Trump has paradoxically bolstered Biden's case.\n\nFor some voters, this election may come down to a choice between preserving democracy and hoping for a return of the low inflation of the Trump years. They may not find it an easy choice.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 38% of Americans believe the country needs \"a leader who is willing to break some rules if that's what it takes to set things right.\" That substantial minority included 48% of Republicans.\n\nWhen Time's reporter asked Trump whether his rhetoric about overriding the Constitution and ruling as a \"dictator for a day\" might alienate voters, the former president disagreed.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [],

In an unusually detailed interview with Time magazine last week, the Republican nominee sent fresh chills down liberal spines by laying out what he would do if he recaptured the presidency.\n\nThis included rounding up millions of illegal immigrants, deploying the military to disperse protests on America's streets, imposing loyalty tests on federal civil servants, letting Republican states monitor women's pregnancies, and scrapping the White House's pandemic preparedness office (because last time that went so swimmingly).\n\nHe repeatedly declined to rule out violence if he lost in November.\n\nAmerica's media is understandably focused on the radical import of Trump's domestic agenda. But some of his clearest language was directed at Europe.\n\n[ The many faces of Donald Trump ]\n\nThere was nothing new in his plans to treat Nato like a fee-paying club - countries that miss their 2 per cent of gross domestic product defence spending target would not be able to count on the United States coming to their aid. Nor was it a surprise that he would escalate his first term's transatlantic trade war. What was striking, however, was the repeated emphasis he put on both.\n\n\"The [EU] is brutal to us on trade,\" Trump said. \"We went over it, the cars, they don't want our agriculture. They don't want anything from us. It's like a one-way street. Well, it's the same thing with Nato. They treat us very badly. They don't pay their bills.\"\n\nOne European response is to hope that Trump will lose in November. That would be a rash wager. In 2020, Biden beat him by more than 4 percentage points in the popular vote. Average polls in the last three months show Trump with a 1.5 percentage point lead. More ominously, he leads, albeit marginally, in each of the seven swing states.\n\n[ US regulator shuts down Trump Media auditor over 'massive fraud' ]\n\nIt is too soon to take such polls seriously. But if the US election were held today, Trump would win.\n\nA second response, which many US business leaders are taking, is to say that Trump was not that bad the first time round. There would be winners and losers but life would go on. Earlier this year, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, said that each of Trump and Biden had their strong points. \"My company will survive and thrive in both.\"\n\nMany in Europe would be inclined to echo Dimon's self-reassurance. That, too, would be foolhardy.\n\nThe difference between 2024 and 2016, when Trump last won the presidency, is that this time he has a plan. From Europe's perspective, it would look like Fortress United States. Moreover, he can now draw on a roster of true believers to carry it out.\n\nIn his first term, he appointed establishment figures, such as Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and Jim Mattis as defence secretary. This time he would pick proven Eurosceptics, such as Elbridge Colby, who runs the Marathon Initiative think tank, and overt Europhobes, such as Richard Grenell, Trump's former ambassador to Germany.\n\n\"The advantage I have now is I know everybody,\" said Trump. \"I know the good, the bad, the stupid, the smart... When I first got to Washington, I knew very few people.\"\n\n[ Zelenskiy says deliveries of US weapons must be faster ]\n\nIt is unclear what Europe can do to hedge against Trump 2.0. A tiny minority of European leaders, notably Hungary's Viktor Orban, would welcome his return. So would Russia's Vladimir Putin. If, as expected, Europe's far right does well in next month's European parliamentary elections, Trump would have a larger group of sympathisers in Brussels than before.\n\nHe might also be able to count on the support of Giorgia Meloni, Italy's hard-right prime minister, who, to the surprise of some, has co-operated with Joe Biden over Ukraine.\n\nAmong Europe's mainstream parties, another strategy is to tame the tiger.\n\nThe UK's Labour Party, which will almost certainly win Britain's next general election, has been putting out feelers to key figures in the Trump world. Britain's shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, will visit Washington next week for the sixth time since taking his role. He has forged relationships with Colby; JD Vance, the Republican senator and Ukraine sceptic; Robert O'Brien, Trump's last national security adviser; and Mike Pompeo, Trump's last secretary of state.\n\nSince Trump has a special animosity for the EU, Britain, regardless of its government, might even be a beneficiary. In the pro-Trump Heritage Foundation's 887-page \"Project 2025'' document, the de facto plan for a Trump presidency, Britain is singled out as the only country with which a Trumpian US would seek to do more trade.\n\n[ Joe Biden denounces violent campus protests after police storm pro-Palestinian camp at UCLA ]\n\nNone of these tactics - sticking your head in the sand, making friends with Trump or even welcoming him - are foolproof. The larger reality is that a second Trump term would be likely to spell the end of the West as an organising idea on the world stage.\n\nThis would be great news for Putin and terrible for Ukraine. It could also open a nuclear Pandora's box. If Nato could no longer count on America's umbrella, countries such as Germany and even Poland might consider going nuclear. It is no small irony that Trump would probably have no issue with that. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_trade_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States trade war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Mattis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Mattis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rex Tillerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euroscepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._O'Brien", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert C.

As recent developments reveal, the brand of Donald Trump is following suit, circling the drain much like the ogre himself.\n\nTruth Social, which claims to promote \"an open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating on the basis of political ideology,\" has seen better days. According to a recent CNN report, Truth Social \"remains a very tiny player in its industry, and it's getting even smaller.\" Truth Social's average number of daily active U.S. users on iOS and Android fell 19% year over year in April to about 113,000, according to Similarweb data. The data also showed the average number of users dropping 4% month over month. This implies Trump isn't getting the support he hoped for while involved with both his presidential campaign and criminal trial defense.\n\nThe saga of Trump's name coming off buildings also shows no sign of abating. Many residents of Trump Plaza in New Rochelle, New York, are trying to remove Trump's name from their 40-story building. Not only are these residents disgusted with Trump and concerned about property values, but removing the name \"would spare residents and workers in this racially diverse city of 80,000 people from encountering, at least visually, the Trump name,\" according to a report from The Guardian.\n\nFinally, Trump Tower in New York City, which the Trump Organization still calls \"one of the most iconic and sought after commercial properties in the world,\" has also suffered a fall from grace. Calling it the \"saddest building in NYC,\" The Daily Beast recently detailed how Trump Tower is losing whatever was left of its spark. The foot traffic and occupancy rates have declined, the landmark 60-foot waterfall has been shut off, and retail spaces sit vacant, among other signs of deterioration.\n\nThese are just some of the most recent signs that both Donald Trump and his brand are fading fast. It's the last thing that he and the Republican Party need when Election Day is only half a year away. However, it's another reason to stay optimistic in these final months, as Trump and his brand continue their twisted, own-way journey into the ether.", "source": {"uri": "palmerreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palmer Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_leshnower@palmerreport.com", "name": "Ron Leshnower", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Plaza_Hotel_and_Casino", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Rochelle,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Rochelle, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Rochelle, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.palmerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/donald-trump-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539883", "eventUri": "eng-9539883", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

More recently, he has criticized a similar sale-or-ban effort signed into law by President Biden as mostly benefiting Facebook, which he has partially blamed for his election loss.\n\nTrump would be one of the few high-profile Republicans to use the app, which many in his party have attacked over concerns that the Chinese government could use it to gather data on Americans or spread propaganda.\n\nThe discussions within the Trump campaign have centered on whether the benefits he might accrue politically would be worth the criticism, primarily from Republicans and those in the intelligence community who have crusaded against the app, people with knowledge of the conversations said. They are also trying to figure out how Trump's brand can be translated to TikTok, a youth-beloved app with a culture all its own.\n\nThe advisers have argued that the platform would help the campaign reach voters, undercut Biden and tap into an online undercurrent of Trump support. The video app is one of the country's most popular media platforms, with 170 million U.S. accounts.\n\nSeveral advisers said that Trump would be unlikely to use it himself - preferring to post on the website he owns, Truth Social - but that advisers could post in his name and potentially include videos that he records.\n\nAmong those making the strongest arguments to Trump and his advisers is Kellyanne Conway, a former senior White House official who remains close to Trump and his team and is being paid to advocate for TikTok through the conservative advocacy group Club for Growth.\n\nConway has told Trump that he has more supporters than Biden on the app and that many young people are forming their opinion based on what they see on their TikTok feeds.\n\nAnd unlike other social networks such as Facebook and X, she has argued to Trump, he was never banned from TikTok.\n\nDavid Urban, another Trump ally who has lobbied for TikTok, has made similar cases to Jason Miller and John Brabender, two Trump advisers.\n\nConway told The Washington Post in March that Trump believed the TikTok sale-or-ban effort was \"about abruptly taking away something from millions of users, many of whom are his people.\"\n\nJoining TikTok, however, could upset Trump allies who are hawkish on China and support aggressive action against the app. Many Republicans have taken to calling the app a \"weapon in the hands of Communist China\" and \"digital fentanyl,\" including former vice president Mike Pence, who has criticized Trump for defending the app.\n\n\"Too many politicians talk a big game but crack under the pressure of wealthy donors or personal grudges - including my former running mate,\" Pence wrote in a Fox News column in March. \"When lobbyists for a company controlled by the Chinese Communist Party can turn a former president against his own political legacy, we should all be concerned.\" (ByteDance has said it is owned primarily by institutional investors and is not controlled by the Chinese government.)\n\nFormer Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who runs an influential right-wing podcast, has suggested that Trump's softening on TikTok was driven by his desire for \"Yass Coin\" - money from Club for Growth megadonor Jeff Yass, whose trading firm, Susquehanna International Group, owns roughly 15 percent of ByteDance. Trump said in March that he had not discussed TikTok with Yass, and a person familiar with Yass's affairs said he has no plans to donate to Trump's campaign.\n\nThe outcome of the discussions is still uncertain, with some advisers noting that Trump has been too busy with his ongoing New York hush money trial and campaign appearances to decide on the issue.\n\nSome aides have suggested that Dan Scavino, a longtime Trump adviser who led his White House's social media operation, could add TikTok to his portfolio alongside posts on Trump's accounts on Truth Social, Facebook and Instagram. Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, has given Scavino more than $2 million in promissory notes, $240,000 in consulting fees and $600,000 in bonuses, company filings show.\n\nAdvisers in favor of the idea have argued that Trump's punchy quips and scene-stealing moments are well-calibrated for virality on TikTok and would help further distinguish him from Biden, whom they are eager to present as out of touch. One proposal that has been discussed: launching the account with a video showing Trump dancing on a rally stage, already a meme.\n\nThe hope among supportive advisers, one of the people said, is to fuel a sense that \"being pro-Trump had become a counterculture movement, and ... that it is the cool, edgy thing to be Trump-adjacent.\"\n\nSome in Trump's orbit also said they see a moment to boost support among younger voters angry at Biden over his stance on the Israel-Gaza war and his signing of the TikTok law. The Biden campaign's posts on TikTok in recent days have been flooded with comments criticizing the president for \"taking TikTok away.\"\n\nOnly a few dozen members of Congress use TikTok, and all are Democrats or independents; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have major presences on the app, with more than a million followers. Biden's campaign has said it will continue using TikTok while his administration gears up to defend its sale-or-ban law in court.\n\nBut pro-Trump content is common on TikTok, and accounts with such names as \"AmericaFirst617,\" which post celebratory videos from Trump's rallies and interviews, have gained hundreds of thousands of followers and millions of likes. One account, \"The Trumpest,\" which organizes clips of Trump into playlists with such names as \"Donald vs reporters\" and \"Donald Funniest moments,\" has 755,000 followers - more than twice as many as the Biden campaign's 314,000.\n\nTikTok hosts plenty of criticism of Trump, too, and the Biden White House has worked to build relationships with its most prominent content creators by inviting them for briefings on such issues as the Ukraine war. Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer turned critic, has live-streamed on TikTok nightly during the hush money trial, in which he plays a central role.\n\nBut some in Trump's circle are also finding a robust TikTok audience. John McEntee, who was head of personnel in Trump's White House, regularly posts to the 2-million-follower account of the Right Stuff, a \"dating app for the right wing\" he co-founded in 2022. And Trump's daughter Ivanka joined TikTok with a verified account in March, posting a video showing her, her husband, Jared Kushner, and their 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, on a \"dreamy voyage of love, laughter and unforgettable moments\" in India.\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who in 2022 called TikTok a \"Trojan Horse for the [Chinese Communist Party] to corrupt American kids,\" joined the platform last year, leading to some internal party criticism of his about-face. After Nikki Haley noted his reversal last year on the GOP candidate debate stage, Ramaswamy fired back that Haley's daughter used it, leading Haley to call him \"scum.\"\n\nRamaswamy has 467,000 followers, more than Biden's campaign, and has defended joining TikTok as critical to capturing a new generation of Americans online. \"It's idiotic for Republicans to complain that TikTok content skews pro-Democrat, while also boycotting TikTok & criticizing Republicans who use it,\" he wrote on X in January. \"Time for the Grand Old Party to show up & grow up. That's how we'll actually win.\"\n\nRelated Content\n\nAfter years of delay, Boeing to try again with Starliner space capsule\n\nTears and despair at Florida abortion clinic in final hours before

Among suburban men, Trump leads Biden by eight points (49 percent - 41 percent).\n\nWATCH -- Fans Cheer for Trump as He Arrives at Formula One Miami Grand Prix:\n\nThe poll sampled 2,260 adults from April 25-30 with a 2-point margin of error.\n\nTrump's strength grew since 2023 among suburban women. In April 2023, 54 percent of white suburban women supported Biden and 41 percent supported Trump, a Wall Street Journal poll found, a 13-point gap that since closed.\n\nWhite suburban women in 2020 backed Biden to help unseat Trump, the Hill reported in June 2023:\n\nSuburban women voters have also largely turned their backs on Republicans since the former president was elected in 2016. According to CBS News exit polling from 2018, 53 percent of suburban women voters said they voted for Democrats in 2018, up from 47 percent in 2014 and 51 percent in 2016. In 2020, Biden won 54 percent of suburban voters in general, according to the Pew Research Center. And in last year's midterm elections, suburban voters, including women in this group, helped deliver major victories to Democrats in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia, with many of Trump's endorsed candidates facing defeat.\n\nWATCH -- Maher: Trump Was a More Pro-Israel President than Biden Is:\n\nTrump's growing strength among suburban women is mirrored by his increased support among black and Hispanic voters, two more historically loyal demographics for Democrats.\n\nDemocrat inroads among those groups of voters deteriorated to the lowest point in 60 years, polling from Gallup and Siena College recently revealed. In turn, Hispanic and black men could vote for Trump in proportions not seen in American politics since the 1950s.\n\nThirty percent of black men and 11 percent of black women intend to vote for Trump in 2024, Journal polling found in April. Only 12 percent of black men voted for Trump in 2020, voting data shows. There is no compatible 2020 polling for black men.

A lot of people look at what he's up against every day and see his real character,\" the Sports Illustrated beauty gushed about Trump, 77.\n\nThe RNC, which said it acts as \"one unified operation\" with the Trump campaign, underwent a major overhaul in March after the ouster of longtime chair Ronna McDaniel.\n\nNew co-chairs Michael Whatley and Trump daughter-in-law, Lara Trump have since overseen a significant staffing shake-up that reportedly included some 60 axed employees.\n\nThe committee's current laser focus is on fundraising, beefing up what Trump calls \"election integrity\" and mounting the \"most aggressive early voter turnout campaign ever\" in the critical months leading up to the expected nail-biter election Nov. 5 as Trump leads President Biden in key battleground states in new polls.\n\nPipko, the daughter of Jewish Russian immigrants who fled religious persecution, said she considers herself the embodiment of the American dream -- and can't wait to make \"a difference.\n\n\"This is one of the biggest elections in this country's history,\" said the self-described \"proud religious Jew,\" whose resume includes nabbing Ivy League degrees from Harvard and Penn universities and publishing three books.\n\n\"Only in this country can a daughter of immigrants who arrived here with nothing get a chance to make some kind of a difference like this. So when you get that chance, you take it.\"\n\nPipko recalled her first trip to the nation's capital as a young girl and \"staring at the White House for six hours,\" a reflection of her \"obsession with America.\"\n\nShe said she has been modeling since she was 17, when she signed with the powerhouse agency Wilhelmina, leading to racy features in Maxim, Esquire and Sports Illustrated.\n\nShe is also a model of moxie - proudly baring it all and coming out of the fashion closet as a Trump supporter in 2019, eventually damaging her career in a left-leaning industry.\n\n\"I lost everything - all of my connections,\" including agents, bookers, photographers and friends, Pipko said.\n\nShe said that after finding her way back into the industry, she can't decide which is more cutthroat: modeling or politics.\n\n\"I tell people my modeling career prepared me for politics, as they're both equally brutal,\" Pipko said, noting that those with sharp cheekbones and even sharper elbows in modeling groomed her for the political swamp. \"Every world I've been in is cutthroat.\"\n\nShe worked her way up from being a Trump campaign volunteer to paid aide during his successful 2016 run, then moved on to political activism as a founder of Exodus Movement, a PAC fighting antisemitism.\n\nThe model got married at Mar-a-Lago in December 2018 to Darren Centinello, who she met on the 2016 Trump campaign. Centinello currently works for the Trump campaign.\n\nPipko said haters who discount and underestimate her because of her looks only fuel her.\n\n\"I've always been the kind of person who wanted to prove people wrong,\" she said.\n\nAsked the burning question that every political observer wants the answer to - who will be Trump's running mate -- Pipko only said, \"He's very big on people earning their way into things.\"\n\nShe said Trump himself has earned the respect of a widespread demographic, charming starstruck hardhats at construction sites, Bronx bodega workers and Big Apple Bravest while in town for his hush-money trial.\n\n\"New Yorkers are real people - they see through everything that's going on,\" she said.\n\nPipko said she has faith that the American people will cut through what she called Soviet-style tactics to snuff out a political rival.\n\n\"But I think it's less about him and what they're doing to him and how this has happened in the greatest country in the world,\" Pipko said of Trump critics including prosecutors targeting him in four criminal cases. \"I think back to everything my parents told me about the former Soviet Union. It's insane to think that this is basically what we've become in front of my eyes.\n\n\"I grew up listening to their stories thinking it could never happen in the US, and yet here we are,\" she said.\n\nPipko said that even though swampy DC is her \"least favorite place,\" she'd be more than happy to return to celebrate a victorious Trump return to the White House.\n\n\"I don't think there's a day when I haven't loved America,\" Pipko said.\n\nShe added that she is more than happy to bust tedious personal stereotypes along the way.\n\n\"Any time you accomplish anything, there will always be people who will say to your face, 'You probably only got that because of your looks,' \" Pipko said.\n\nBut she said she doesn't lose sleep over it.\n\n\"I'm true to myself. I know I'm a lot more than what people think about me.\"\n\nLara Trump said in a statement to The Post, \"At a time when patriotism among young Americans sits at record lows, we are lucky to have great Americans like Elizabeth Pipko on our team -- she will help to inspire the next generation, rebuild the grand old party, and bring our country back.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

(Atlanta News First) - Ahead of President Joe Biden's upcoming Morehouse College commencement speech and just after his wife dropped by for a visit, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will be in Atlanta Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the Biden-Harris reelection campaign, Emhoff will convene a reproductive health care panel with providers, students, and local leaders. Afterwards, the campaign said he will meet with small business owners.\n\nThe timing of Emhoff's events was not released by the campaign.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris was in Atlanta last week, kicking off the campaign's \"Economic Opportunity Tour.\" That event marked Harris' 12th trip to Georgia during the Biden administration.\n\nOn May 19, Biden will become the second sitting American president to deliver Morehouse College's commencement address, following in the footsteps of his former boss, Barack Obama.\n\nHis speech will mark the president's first visit back to the Peach State after a March campaign rally. In 2013, then-President Obama - under whom Biden served as vice president - delivered Morehouse's commencement address for that class.\n\nBiden's Morehouse address is his second time delivering a commencement address to an HBCU. Last year, Biden spoke at Howard University, the alma mater of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nGeorgia is a key focus in the 2024 presidential election for a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nA March 2024 memo from Biden's reelection campaign stressed Georgia as \"an extremely competitive state\" in November's election.\n\nThe memo from reelection campaign chair Julie Chavez Rodriguez said Biden's campaign \"has made our earliest ever investment in paid media in Georgia and North Carolina, including a historic $25-million, 16-week TV ad campaign to reach general election voters across key battleground states last year and a six-week, $30-million spring ad buy that kicked off in March.\"\n\nGeorgia, according to Rodriguez, was the closest state in the country won by Biden in 2020, and North Carolina was the closest state in the country won by Trump.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump are the respective, presumptive Democratic and GOP nominees for president, setting the stage for an historic rematch of their 2020 campaigns. They have been polling well within the margins of error for every poll thus far in the election season, making Georgia a virtual toss-up.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes.\n\nOnly days before his historic criminal trial began, Trump held a major, private fundraiser at Atlanta's St. Regis Hotel.\n\nTrump is now on trial in New York in a case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, all of which are tied to the former president's role in a hush-money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump is also under indictment in Atlanta. He and 13 remaining co-defendants are accused of engaging in an organized crime-like scheme to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results, an election that saw Biden become the first Democrat since 1992 to carry any deep Southern state in a presidential contest.\n\nNovember's election will be the first presidential electoral rematch since 1956. In 1952, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson after then-President Harry Truman chose not to run for a second full term. Four years later, Democrats again nominated Stevenson for the presidency, which led to a second defeat at then-President Eisenhower's hands.\n\nAmong Republicans, no presidential candidate has ever been nominated for three consecutive elections; Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, was elected president in 1885 and served only one term before being elected to a second term four years later (1885-1889 and 1893-1897). President Franklin Delano Roosevelt holds the record for the most nominations: four.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commencement speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morehouse_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morehouse College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peach County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peach County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Ch\u00e1vez_Rodriguez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Through decisions like Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, and Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are advancing democracy by preventing unelected bureaucrats and judges from usurping legislative power and protecting all Americans from race discrimination.\n\nThe U.S. economy thrived during the Trump presidency before COVID-19, aided by Mr. Trump's tax cuts, deregulation, and promotion of fossil fuel production. Cumulative inflation for the first three years of Mr. Trump's presidency was 6%, about 2% per year, compared with cumulative inflation of 18% for President Biden's first three years (Mr. Biden's inflation peaked at over 9%, the highest level in 40 years). In Mr. Trump's first three years, the S&P and Dow Jones indexes climbed 47% and 49%, respectively, gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, and the U.S. became a net energy exporter.\n\nEmployment increased, with Black and Hispanic labor participation rates reaching all-time highs and the overall unemployment rate hitting a 50-year low of 3.5%. Under Mr. Trump, wages rose sharply, and the poverty rate plummeted to an all-time low of 10.5%. On a percentage basis, earnings and net worth of blue-collar workers grew more quickly than those of the top 1%. Mortgage rates dropped to under 3%.\n\nFar from amassing dictatorial powers, Mr. Trump eschewed unconstitutional overreaches of executive authority. No \"I've got a pen and I've got a phone,\" the Trump administration worked through Congress and followed proper administrative procedures to achieve policy changes while undoing President Barack Obama's unconstitutional exercises of power by fiat. It was Mr. Biden, not Mr. Trump, who unilaterally attempted to cancel student debt, block mortgage foreclosures, hinder fossil fuel production, open the border, suppress free speech, impose a radical climate agenda, and de facto ban gasoline-powered cars and trucks.\n\nThe Trump presidency was the most peaceful since the Carter administration. Mr. Trump's opening wide the U.S. fossil fuel spigot reduced worldwide oil and natural gas prices and thereby weakened Russia. The Trump presidency was the only presidency in the last four in which Russia did not invade a neighbor. Mr. Trump's sending lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, something Mr. Obama refused to do, certainly aided Ukraine's resistance when Russia attacked -- after Mr. Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal debacle and \"minor incursion\" gaffe.\n\nMr. Trump was arguably the most pro-Israel president since Harry Truman, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and mediating the Abraham Accords. And the Trump administration sought to unwind terrible deals with Iran, which even now is using previously frozen U.S. dollars to support Russia in Ukraine, Hamas in Israel, and the Houthis as they attack U.S. and allied shipping. Mr. Trump recognized China as a major geopolitical threat.\n\nThe Trump administration depoliticized the Department of Justice and restored it as an evenhanded body that fairly promotes justice for all, regardless of political party. One need look no further than DOJ's refusal to claim the 2020 election had been materially affected by fraud and compare its activities to those of the Biden DOJ to see how apolitical the Trump DOJ was.\n\nThe Trump administration took on some of Washington's most intractable issues. It enacted the first major tax reform since 1986 and criminal justice reform. Mr. Trump took head-on immigration, albeit with limited success because of opposition in Congress. The U.S. did not have an open border under Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump nominated the first openly gay Cabinet secretary, Richard Grenell, whose nomination was blocked by Democrats in the Senate, and openly gay federal judges. Ever the fighter, Mr. Trump exposed the mainstream media as often untrustworthy purveyors of falsehoods and spin.\n\nCOVID-19 was unique in modern times. On the plus side, as the pandemic progressed, the Trump administration avoided a national panic, kept necessary services and products available, promoted a public-private partnership that produced vaccines years earlier than the \"experts\" said possible, and sought to protect religious liberty and other civil rights. Rather than becoming a dictator, Mr. Trump followed the Constitution by letting the states set local COVID-19 policy. On the negative side, Mr. Trump likely listened too much to the purported experts, and on his watch, the deep state and \"experts\" co-opted social media and suppressed free speech.\n\nSome fear that Mr. Trump will be a lawless president. What they largely fear is that Mr. Trump will do unto his political opponents what they have done unto him -- weaponizing law enforcement and administrative agencies to settle political scores. Most Americans rightly believe there are now two systems of justice -- one for the Trumps of the world and one for Washington elites such as Hillary Clinton and the Bidens. Perhaps Mr. Trump will seek revenge rather than turn the other cheek, but if his first term is a guide, he may instead again depoliticize the Department of Justice and return evenhanded justice to our country.\n\nThere are many critics willing to rail against Mr. Trump, so I need not repeat their arguments here. Certainly, Mr. Trump is often his own worst enemy.\n\nIn sum, when trying to divine what sort of second presidency a former president will have, a good starting point is to examine the presidency he already had. If Mr. Trump is elected this fall, it will be because a majority of voters think they were better off under Mr. Trump than under Mr. Biden -- and will be again.

But such efforts likely will come up short, experts say.\n\nEach of the presumptive presidential nominees is taking shots at the other's competence and policy ideas, using official events and courthouse rants to go at it. And both are trying to expand the list of swing states -- though experts, history and polling suggest long odds -- as they scramble to stitch together the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win in November.\n\nBiden campaign aides have contended for weeks that the president could turn North Carolina and Florida blue, saying both are in play despite Trump's polling leads there.\n\nOn Sunday, Jason Miller, a senior Trump aide, tweeted this: \"At a private donor retreat, Trump team says Minnesota and Virginia are in play,\" referring to comments Trump reportedly made at a GOP gathering in Florida.\n\nFord O'Connell, a Florida-based Republican political strategist, said in a Monday phone interview that \"any presidential candidate will always want to be trying to expand the electoral map in any way possible.\"\n\nHe added that Trump's weekend prognostication should not be met with much surprise, \"especially since the candidate, in this case, was talking to their more well-heeled donors.\"\n\nKyle Kondik of the University of Virginia said Monday that he \"can see the appeal in trying to expand the map,\" but added: \"Although, I'll only really believe states like Florida, Minnesota, and Virginia are in play if the candidate that won each state in 2020 feels compelled to commit significant resources to defending them.\"\n\nThat means if the winner in each of those states resists the urge to take his opponent's bait, they are unlikely to become actual battlegrounds, according to Kondik. \"It's also unclear exactly how much the 2020 loser spends in those states,\" he added in an email, \"particularly in a state like Florida, you need to really spend big to hit all of the media markets.\"\n\nRepublican nominees have won Florida in four of the last six general elections, including by Trump in 2016 and 2020. North Carolina has been in the GOP column in 10 of the last 12 presidential elections.\n\nThe last Republican to take Minnesota was Richard M. Nixon in 1972, with Virginia recently going to Democrats in the last four elections after Republicans won the state in the previous 10 cycles.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28823/2882340.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539883", "eventUri": "eng-9539883", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 452726785, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 88, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 88}}}

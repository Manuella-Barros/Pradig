Speaking to a CNN stringer in Khan Younis, north of Rafah, people said they did not know where else to go, as they tried to head north toward Deir El-Balah in central Gaza. Video from the stringer shows mattresses, wooden panels, chairs, and various other belongings piled on top of vehicles and donkey carts. \"What\u2019s happening now, whether in Rafah, Khan Younis or Gaza in general, is the disastrous displacement of people. There is no shelter, no life, no future,\" said Ansar Mahdi, who said she's been displaced four times. \"The displacement is repugnant. When people move from one place to another, they want to live.They need money. They\u2019ve lost their savings,\" she said. \"They told us to move from the north to the south. We did. We stayed in tents in abysmal conditions. No words can convey what we went through,\" she added. \"Where else can we go? Where the next displacement would be?\" Mahdi asked. The roads, lined by tents and piles of garbage, were busy with people and vehicles moving in search of empty spaces. Walking on crutches, Mohamed Jarbou, said, \"The elderly have been humiliated. Children humiliated. What\u2019s wrong? They are all civilians. The resistance is not here. The resistance is fighting somewhere else. We are displaced. Why are you hitting the displaced people?\" Israeli strikes over the past two days in Rafah have forced the already displaced people to flee. More than two dozen people were killed in Israel strikes on two camps on Tuesday, according to Palestinian officials. The Israeli military denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, telling CNN, \"Contrary to the reports from the last few hours, the IDF did not strike in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.\u201d CNN has asked if the military struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, and for comment on a strike that hit the Tal al-Sultan camp.", "summary": "<p>Displaced Palestinians are attempting to evacuate following devastating Israeli strikes in southern Gaza \u2013 but they don&#8217;t know where to go.

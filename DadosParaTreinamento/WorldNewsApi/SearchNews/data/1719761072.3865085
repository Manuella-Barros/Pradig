According to CNN, the flight had barely left the airport when there was a \u201csuspected mechanical issue\u201d in the air. \u201cThe Airbus plane, which was headed to Fort Lauderdale, reversed course and safely returned to Montego Bay, Jamaica, \u2018out of an abundance of caution following a suspected mechanical issue,\u2019 the airline said in a statement. The passengers were deplaned and later put on a different plane to reach their destination,\u201d reads the CNN piece. Naturally, the internet was quick to pick up on this story\u2014and now, several people who were on the flight have shared their experiences. Passengers speak out on traumatic Spirit flight In a video posted by Bettina Rogers (@mztinamarie33), she shows the plane taking off before cutting to the cabin in a state of panic. According to an interview she performed with USA Today, this was because the cabin had just been told that there was going to be an emergency water landing. After being told that the plane was going to make an emergency landing, Rogers said the announcements continued. \u201cFive minutes later, it was \u2018Flight attendants, prepare for emergency landing,\u2019 so they got ready.\u2019\u201d she told USA Today. \u201cAnother five minutes went by and he said, \u2018Flight attendants prepare for emergency water landing.\u2019 That\u2019s when the whole plane went frantic.\u201d The video shows the cabin wearing life vests and preparing for the aforementioned landing. Thankfully, the airplane did not have to make an emergency water landing and was able to return to the airport. @mztinamarie33 #fyp #emergencywaterlanding #viral #contentcreator #howtogoviral #emergencylanding #spiritflights \u266c original sound \u2013 MzTinamarie The aftermath of the emergency Another TikTok user who claimed to be on the plane is a TikToker named Will (@wickedwiill). In his video, which currently has over 1.5 million views, he recounts his experience on the plane. According to Will, he had initially suspected there to be an issue once he noticed that the plane was still low to the ground after 5 minutes of flight. Like Rogers, Will recalls that they were initially told that they would be going back to the airport due to a technical issue, only to later be informed that they would be making an emergency water landing. This, he says, caused \u201ceverybody\u201d to \u201cjust [freak] out.\u201d \u201cPeople screaming, people over here praying, I\u2019m crying like h*** because I literally thought I was going to die,\u201d Will recounts. Will says that he accidentally broke his life vest while trying to remove it from under his seat. Thankfully, it ended up not being needed, as the plane was able to make it back to land \u201cby the skin of our teeth.\u201d \u201cWhen people tell you about Spirit Airlines, they telling you for a f***ing reason,\u201d he concludes. \u201cDo not travel Spirit Airlines, especially international. That was the worst f***ing experience of my life, my most near-death experience.\u201d @wickedwiill The way im still shook from this happening yesterday? #spirit #spiritairlines #flight270 #montegobay #jamaica #fyp #travel #insane \u266c original sound \u2013 will Safety on Spirit Airlines While Will appears to lay the blame at the foot of Spirit Airlines, the airline itself has comparable safety numbers to its non-budget counterparts. In fact, according to a survey by WalletHub released earlier this month, Spirit Airlines was the safest airline measured in terms of aviation accidents, injuries and deaths in aviation accidents, and the age of the planes in its fleet. The airline also made it into aviation site Airline Ratings\u2019 top 20 safest low-cost airlines. That said, there are still numerous issues with the airline that have been reported by flyers, such as its numerous surcharges and aggressive behavior from staff. Commenters share their thoughts In the comments section of Will\u2019s video, users discussed their takes on the event. \u201cMy cousin was on this flight,\u201d wrote a user. \u201cThat pilot did his job & you guys landed safely.\u201d \u201cThe way I be passed out with headphones on before the flight even takes off,\u201d added another. \u201cLawd I gotta start staying awake.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad you all are safe! But the way I would be a citizen of Jamaica after that cause AINT NO WAY IM GETTING BACK ON THAT AIRLINE!! Embassy me,\u201d declared a third.

She thanked all those who campaigned for Sinn F\u00e9in as candidates and activists, saying she \u201ccouldn\u2019t have asked for more\u201d from them. \u201cClearly we\u2019re disappointed that we didn\u2019t get more candidates elected. We have made some modest gains but we haven\u2019t had the day that we had hoped for,\u201d she said. She said it seems clear that people who oppose the Government cast their votes for independent candidates and smaller parties on this occasion. \u201cWe need to win those votes back,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ca general election isn\u2019t so far away you know\u201d. \u201cSo, rest. Let\u2019s gather ourselves. Let\u2019s talk to each other, listen to each other and then we get back at it because that\u2019s what Sinn F\u00e9iners do.\u201d As the count continues, I wanted you to hear directly from me. pic.twitter.com/sLdIhUrIhF\u2014 Mary Lou McDonald (@MaryLouMcDonald) June 9, 2024 Sinn F\u00e9in have suffered a major setback in this weekend\u2019s local elections even though the there are hundreds of seats left to fill. As of this afternoon, Sinn F\u00e9in had secured just 20 Local Election Area seats compared to 112 for Fine Gael, 97 for Fianna F\u00e1il, 87 taken by independents and 23 by Labour. Not so long ago Sinn F\u00e9in was by far the post popular party in Ireland and at one point came close to matching Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il combined in the opinion polls. As McDonald acknowledged in her video, it appears that many of the votes the party has lost have gone to independent candidates.", "summary": "McDonald said that now is the time for the party \u201cto reflect, to learn, to adapt and to come back stronger\u201d.", "url": "https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-sinn-fein-disappointed-video-6403428-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6403428/river/?height=400&version=6403503", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:47:11", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.433}

The Cordyceps and Lion\u2019s Mane flavours of Uncle Frog\u2019s Mushroom Gummies were recalled this week by Food Standards Australia New Zealand after reports of hospitalisations in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Uncle Frog company director Rohan Bandil refused to reveal what was in the gummies that were sold online and pushed on Instagram until earlier this week. He said there were \u201cmany other brands selling similar products\u201d. Uncle Frog\u2019s website \u2013 which has now been taken down \u2013 stated that the gummies were \u201cfree from CBD, CBN, and THC, and are 100% legal in Australia\u201d. The packaging encouraged customers to \u201cexperience the multiverse\u201d, claiming they were \u201cinfused with Earth\u2019s finest hemp\u201d. According to NSW Health documents, the product packaging lists \u201cnon-psychoactive mushrooms \u2026 and hemp-derived extract\u201d in the gummies, as well as HHC and cannabidiol (CBD) on some packaging. HHC is hexahydrocannabinol and THC is tetrahydrocannabinol. Both are psychoactive cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant. According to NSW Health, patients experienced \u201cunexpected toxicity\u201d and \u201cdisturbing hallucinations\u201d when consuming the gummies, but experts say the mushrooms are unlikely to be the cause of the issues. Dr Ian Musgrave, a lecturer in pharmacology at the University of Adelaide, said neither Lion\u2019s Mane nor Cordyceps fungi are associated with the side-effects being reported. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Dr Jack Wilson, a University of Sydney postdoctoral researcher, said it was hard to say what was in the gummies without proper testing, but he guessed the effects had something to do with hemp or an unlisted harmful fungi. \u201cThe main point here is that these unregulated products make it difficult to know what psychoactive ingredients were included,\u201d he said. Messages seen by the Guardian that appeared to have been sent by the Uncle Frog Instagram account to prospective customers show the account spruiking the gummies as containing \u201chemp-derived HHC, which may have strong psychoactive effects\u201d. \u201cOut of 100 customers, 100 of them have reported the effects,\u201d one message read. \u201cHHC has effects similar to THC and psilocybin at the same time.\u201d Psilocybin is a psychedelic compound found in some fungi species. Others who claimed to have consumed the products shared their experiences on Reddit this week . One said they had expected a \u201clittle bit of a mellow\u201d but instead \u201cunexpectedly tripped and it was hectic\u201d. Another said they were struggling to move and were \u201cnauseous as hell\u201d after consuming what they thought was \u201cjust normal lion\u2019s mane supplements but got spiked\u201d. \u201cAll I could really do was just lie in my bed next to a spew bucket and wait,\u201d they said. The RMIT chemistry professor Oliver Jones said the ingredients listed on the packet were \u201cnot associated with the symptoms reported\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t technically fully rule out either synthetic cannabinoids or natural cannabinoids without further testing,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither of the fungi listed on the packet are associated with the side effects reported in the media reports but it is possible the fungi in the product are not the ones listed.\u201d Prof Jon Wardle, the foundation director of the National Centre for Naturopathic Medicine at Southern Cross University, suspected there had been some \u201cadulteration, substitution or contamination\u201d of the gummies. \u201cThe products claimed \u2018broad spectrum hemp\u2019 which means a whole plant extract which could potentially contain higher levels of cannabinoids such as THC than listed,\u201d he said. Tim Powell from the drug harm reduction program DanceWize NSW said there had been a sharp increase in the number of gummy sellers using Instagram to find customers over the past few years. He said consumers faced the same issue with these gummies as they do with more typical recreational drugs and warned against purchasing products like these online. \u201cThe theory with this is it appears to be a sort of cannabinoid rather than being any actual mushroom effect,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout every single product of this type going to be comprehensively tested, you\u2019re never really sure what\u2019s going to be in them.\u201d Uncle Frog was contacted for comment.", "summary": "<p>The recall of Uncle Frog\u2019s Mushroom Gummies has sparked concerns that the product contains psychoactive cannabinoids</p><ul><li><strong>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></strong></li></ul><p>A cannabis product could be to blame for more than six people being hospitalised with symptoms including seizure-like twitching, vomiting and hallucinations after consuming gummies marketed as containing mushrooms, according to experts.</p><p>The Cordyceps and Lion\u2019s Mane flavours of Uncle Frog\u2019s Mushroom Gummies were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/27/mushroom-gummies-nsw-health-warning-recall-users-hospitalised-hallucinations-ntwnfb\">recalled this week</a> by Food Standards Australia New Zealand after reports of hospitalisations in New Sou", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/29/mushroom-gummies-powerful-cannabis-product-could-have-caused-disturbing-hallucinations-and-hospitalisations", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c9baa120b0836a7e1eee9bc3dd9a409bc9b1c4/530_137_540_324/master/540.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:00:38", "author": "Natasha May,Tamsin Rose", "authors": ["Natasha May", "Tamsin Rose"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.525}

After the acid attack at the age of 24, former model Piper has been candid about her journey dealing with the complications. She produced a Channel 4 documentary in 2009 titled Katie: My Beautiful Face. She was left partially sightless, with severe scarring to her face, chest, neck, arm and hands, after sulphuric acid was hurled in her face. A few months after the documentary aired, she established the Katie Piper Foundation to aid burns victims and has undergone more than 250 operations in the past decade. The mum-of-two also hosted a podcast, Katie Piper's Extraordinary People, where she talked with inspiring individuals who transformed adversity into positivity, and is also a panellist on ITV's Loose Women. In 2021, she was made OBE in the Queen's New Year Honours list for her services to charity and victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries.", "summary": "TV presenter and activist Katie Piper was not on air this weekend with Good Morning Britain's Charlotte Hawkins filling in", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/katie-piper-reveals-medical-alert-29317799", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29317797.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_katie-piper-hopes-to-make-a-return-to-her-itv-show-next-weekend-ian-westpa.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:02:23", "author": "James Cartledge,Naomi Clarke,PA Senior Entertainment Reporter", "authors": ["James Cartledge", "Naomi Clarke", "PA Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.158}

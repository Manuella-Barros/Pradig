Votes will take place later Sunday for who will be the party\u2019s official nominee for president. Some other notable nominees include Libertarians Chase Oliver, Mike Ter Maat, and Michael Rectenwald.At the convention, one point of order was raised that Kennedy would not be permitted to run as a Libertarian because he did not sign a statement that he was going to seek the nomination as a condition of being a speaker at the event. However, after some back and forth, the party moved forward with allowing Kennedy to be considered.Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy\u2019s pick for vice president, was in attendance at the convention.

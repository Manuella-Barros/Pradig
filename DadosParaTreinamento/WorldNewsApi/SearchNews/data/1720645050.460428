{"id": 231332744, "title": "Long Islander has donated nearly 29 gallons of blood since 1975 \u2014 enough to fill 310 soda cans", "text": "He\u2019s New York City\u2019s best blood banker. Henry Bickoff, 68, of Huntington, LI, has donated 231 pints of blood \u2014 one donation shy of 29 gallons. He started in 1975, and gave 10 pints before they even started keeping computer records. All told, the Long Islander\u2019s blood has helped 693 people, according to the New York Blood Center. He has donated the equivalent of 310 cans of Coke, 870 single-serve scoops of ice cream or nearly six, five-gallon office water cooler bottles. Bickoff, who weighs 157 pounds, was surprised to learn he is the top donor in the tri-state area. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve committed to, and it\u2019s actually nice to get a little bit of recognition for it.\u201d The optometrist made his first donation while in college. \u201cEverybody was doing it,\u201d Bickoff said. \u201cIt was a save-the-world kind of situation of do something good for everybody.\u201d That first experience was not a good one. He was not well hydrated, fed or rested, so he was \u201cvery dizzy\u201d afterward, but it didn\u2019t stop him from returning. \u201cThis may sound silly but I consider it my main act of charity,\u201d Bickoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I can do and it doesn\u2019t take a lot of time. I consider it multitasking \u2014 making blood cells while I\u2019m doing everything else in my life. And it\u2019s just that hour every two months to go down to the blood center and donate.\u201d Bickoff is in a class of his own. \u201cLess than 1/2 a percent of the donor base have donated 20 gallons or more,\u201d said Andrea Cefarelli, senior vice president at NYBC. \u201cThe average person donates a couple of times in their lifetime.\u201d With a B-negative blood type, Bickoff\u2019s blood is in high demand. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the blood types that is often in short supply because it\u2019s only 2% of the population,\u201d Cefarelli said. \u201cA B neg can only receive B neg or O neg. O neg is the universal blood type \u2014 it can be safely transfused to anyone \u2014 but it\u2019s only present in 6% of the population.\u201d Up until the last five to 10 years, Bickoff donated every 56 days like clockwork. With age, \u201cI stretch it out a little bit,\u201d he said. He prepares for game day with an iron supplement. Bickoff\u2019s wife donates blood, though not that frequently. His daughter cannot do so due to a rare blood disorder. And his son is not interested. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not proud of him, though. \u201cIt really is something that makes me so proud of him,\u201d his daughter, Kimberly Mitchell, 36, said. If he were to apply for it, Bickoff would hold the Guinness World Records title for the most whole-blood donations by a male. The title requires 231 units to qualify, a Guinness spokesperson said, exactly what Bickoff has donated. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Bickoff said modestly, noting he hit 231 units at his last donation May 16. He said he will likely apply for the designation, but if not, his daughter would do it for him.", "summary": "Henry Bickoff, 68, of Huntington, LI, has donated 231 pints of blood \u2014 one donation shy of 29 gallons.

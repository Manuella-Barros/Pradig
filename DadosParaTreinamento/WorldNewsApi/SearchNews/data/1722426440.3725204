Whilst we often think of colds and flu hitting in the colder months summer has its own share of bugs and sickness. So while boosting your immune system and having plenty of first aid and flu remedies are important in winter they could also be key in summer. Steroplast Healthcare has drawn up five summer ailments and how to treat them. Hay fever While many will be concerned with hay fever over the summer others can feel grateful they have never had it. However just because you or your children have not been affected in the past, it doesn\u2019t mean you will always be in the clear. The Steroplast Healthcare expert warned: \"Many people develop hay fever spontaneously and in turn are completely ill-equipped to deal with it. It is therefore wise to have antihistamines on hand to ease symptoms should they arise. \"Air pollution, increased stress levels and genetic predispositions have all been blamed for the rise in hay fever cases. But no matter why it arises, if it does it can wreak a great deal of havoc with both personal and working lives.\" Asthma When pollen levels are high hay fever is not the only ailment which can hit. It can also affect people with breathing issues such as asthma. From extended time spent outside to the higher humidity experienced in the summer, there are many reasons why asthma may well be worse in the summer months. Keeping medication and inhalers replenished and readily available as well as staying inside when the pollen count or humidity is particularly high may be a wise idea for adults and children alike who are faced with breathing difficulties they warned. Food poisoning Food poisoning can rear its head far more often in summer rather than winter. The heat and humidity offer the perfect conditions for bacteria to breed and flourish. During warm spells, always keep perishable food refrigerated. Also ensure that you adhere to sell-by dates even more strictly than usual Heat stroke and sunburn Heat-related issues are common during the summer months for obvious reasons. They are more likely to affect older people because as we get older we lose our ability to effectively deal with heat. Key ways to tackle it before it is too late include spending less time outdoors at the hottest times of day to simply keeping hydrated, wearing a sun hat and using sunblock. There will be many ways to help mitigate the dangers of the sun and even if we are not the hottest country in the world. the warmest days can still do significant damage. Lyme disease Spread by ticks which love the summer heat, Lyme disease is estimated to affect around 3,000 people in Britain each year. Common symptoms include a pink or red rash and flu-like symptoms. However, when left untreated it can also cause muscle pain, swelling and even mild and temporary paralysis. Whilst there is no vaccine, such dangers can be mitigated by wearing insect repellent and avoiding heavily wooded areas. It also helps to wear long-sleeved shirts and to be on the lookout for ticks when you are in the countryside.", "summary": "Many people think of health problems being more likely in the winter but the summer has a number of risks of its own", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/five-health-risks-hit-summer-33119355", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33044872.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_I-am-hypersensitive.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:18:25", "author": "Elaine Blackburne", "authors": ["Elaine Blackburne"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.117}

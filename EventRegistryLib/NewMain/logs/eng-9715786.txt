With the 2024 season right around the corner, various Big 12 coaches and athletes are set to descend upon Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium from July 9-10 to kick off this year's conference media days slate. The conference already released its preseason all-conference team as well as its projected order of finish.\n\nFor a second consecutive season, a robust set of newcomers will take center stage. The Big 12 benefited from the Pac-12's dissolution by welcoming Utah, Arizona, Arizona State and Colorado to its ranks. Preseason favorite Utah highlights the schools speaking on Tuesday, while Deion Sanders will make his much-anticipated first official appearance as a Big 12 coach to open up the proceedings on Wednesday.\n\nThe Big 12 does have to contend with its own notable departures as this will be the first media days slate without Texas or Oklahoma since the conference's inception. There are several schools in contention to fill the power vacuum left by those two programs, who combined to win seven of the last nine conference titles.\n\nAdding extra heat to the conference race -- aside from the record, 120-degree temps hitting Sin City this week -- is the fact that whoever emerges as the eventual winner locks down an automatic spot in the new 12-team College Football Playoff. Suffice to say, there are plenty of storylines to keep an eye on this week as the Big 12 Media Days unfold.\n\nDeion makes his debut\n\nColorado's return to the Big 12 comes with much fanfare thanks to the presence of coach Deion Sanders, one of college football's most electric -- and enigmatic -- personalities. He thrives in a media setting and certainly isn't afraid to say what's on his mind, but what's interesting about this week is it's Sanders' first power-conference media days. Sanders missed the 2023 Pac-12 Media Days recovering from surgery and the year before was at Jackson State. Sanders figures to be swarmed by reporters and how he commands the room during the more raucous breakout sessions -- where national media will be trying their best to get the quote of the week -- will be good for a social clip or two.\n\nThe Buffaloes certainly have plenty to tout amid their conference move. Two-way star Travis Hunter is perhaps the best player in college football. He can excel as both a wide receiver and defensive back, was named the preseason Defensive Player of the Year while quarterback Shedeur Sanders, Deion's son, earned a spot on the All-Big 12 team.\n\nIn total, the Buffaloes had three players on the All-Big 12 team, an impressive mark for a conference newcomer. Whether that lends itself to improvement on 2023's 4-8 record remains to be seen.\n\nUtah facing big expectations\n\nUtah is expected to hit the ground running once the 2024 season begins. In fact, the Utes are the outright favorite to win the Big 12 in their first year with the conference.\n\nThey received 20 first-place votes in the Big 12 media poll and took the top spot with 906 total points. It's not hard to see why voters would have so much faith in Utah. Coach Kyle Whittingham led his team to two Pac-12 titles in the past three years and posted an eight-win season in 2023 despite missing quarterback Cam Rising for the entire year.\n\nRising is back for another season and profiles as one of the Big 12's top signal callers. He has an underrated group of skill talent players surrounding him, including All-Big 12 tight end Brant Kuithe, and an offensive line that returns three starters. The defense has a ton of production back as well and looks particularly stacked in the front seven.\n\nThe pieces are certainly there to make a run, but the Big 12 seems wide open and it's always among the nation's most chaotic conferences.\n\nThe most tantalizing news piece that could come out of Whittingham's media session, however, would be whether he offers a timeline to Utah's announced succession plan that positions defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley as the head coach-in-waiting.\n\nKansas State a quiet favorite\n\nKansas State wasn't too far behind Utah in the preseason poll, receiving 19 first-place votes and falling just 17 points short of supplanting the Utes at the top. Yet it doesn't seem like the Wildcats have generated that much hype in the preseason.\n\nThey were one of just five teams without a player on the preseason All-Big 12 team. They've been included in multiple top-25 projections but have rarely appeared in any conversations surrounding the College Football Playoff, though a Big 12 Championship Game berth would put them one win away.\n\nA lot of Kansas State's hopes hinge on the development of new starting quarterback Avery Johnson, one of the most ballyhooed signings in program history. His outlook is positive but his experience to this point is still relatively thin. Regardless, it's hard to doubt against Chris Klieman given his 19 wins over the past two years and the fact that he won the Big 12 as recently as 2022.\n\nWhat to do with Ollie Gordon II\n\nOklahoma State running back Ollie Gordon II is the preseason Offensive Player of the Year and was the only unanimous All-Big 12 selection. It makes sense, given the fact that he won the 2023 Doak Walker Award and finished seventh in Heisman Trophy voting.\n\nHe is one of college football's preeminent stars. His outlook has also become considerably more cloudy following his recent arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence and driving over the speed limit.\n\nOklahoma State has yet to really address the situation. Coach Mike Gundy will almost certainly be asked about it during his time at the podium and his answer -- provided it's anything more than \"no comment at this time\" -- could provide some insight into Gordon's status for the 2024 season.\n\nIs there a second-year leap in store?\n\nThe 2023 campaign was not kind to conference newcomers. Out of the four former Group of Five powers to make the jump in competition, UCF fared the best with its 3-6 showing in conference play. Houston and BYU won two games apiece, while Cincinnati limped to a 3-9 overall record with one Big 12 win.\n\nThe Big 12 media poll doesn't envision a major sophomore leap for any of those four programs, either. UCF was picked to finish eighth, while BYU, Cincinnati and Houston occupied the 13-15 spots, respectively.\n\nTeam VotesUtah906 (20)Kansas State889 (19)Oklahoma State 829 (14)Kansas772 (5)Arizona762 (3)lowa State661West Virginia581UCF551Texas Tech532TCU436Colorado400Baylor268BYU215Cincinnati196Houston157Arizona State141\n\nHouston tried to spark major change by moving on from Dana Holgorsen and hiring Willie Fritz as his successor. Fritz had a 23-4 record in his last two years at Tulane, but it took him a while to get to that point. Media days will allow Fritz, and the incumbent coaches among second-year Big 12 schools, to lay out their vision for 2024 with the hope for improvement at the forefront.\n\nKeep an eye on Kansas\n\nIt could be a prolific year in the Sunflower State, if the Big 12 media poll is any indication. Kansas nabbed the No. 4 spot, behind Utah, Kansas State and Oklahoma State. The Jayhawks even received five votes for first place.\n\nIt's their highest preseason ranking since the Big 12 went to a non-divisional format in 2011. The optimism is well-founded after back-to-back bowl appearances for the first time in well over a decade. The Jayhawks went 9-4 last year, their best record since 2007, and have steadily built on their win total in each of their three years under coach Lance Leipold.\n\nNow the core of that roster that has achieved so much over the last two years is back for another go around. If quarterback Jalon Daniels can stay healthy, the Jayhawks are legit competitors in the Big 12 -- and maybe even more.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"},

From July 9-10, Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium will be the epicenter of college football discussions, with coaches and athletes converging to set the stage for the 2024 season.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the Big 12 is embracing a fresh set of teams. The conference has expanded its reach by adding Utah, Arizona, Arizona State, and Colorado, capitalizing on the dissolution of the Pac-12. This expansion not only increases the conference's footprint but also brings in programs with strong football traditions and passionate fan bases. Among these newcomers, Utah stands out as the preseason favorite, thanks to their recent success in the Pac-12.\n\nUtah is set to make an immediate impact in the Big 12. They are the outright favorite to win the conference, receiving 20 first-place votes in the media poll. Under the leadership of Coach Kyle Whittingham, the Utes have secured two Pac-12 titles in the past three years and posted an impressive eight-win season in 2023 despite the absence of quarterback Cam Rising. With Rising's return, along with a strong supporting cast including All-Big 12 tight end Brant Kuithe and a formidable offensive line, Utah appears poised for success. Their defense, especially the front seven, looks equally strong. The team's potential run for the title will be closely watched, especially if Whittingham addresses the timeline for defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley's ascension to head coach.\n\nKansas is generating significant buzz ahead of the season. Ranked fourth in the Big 12 media poll, the Jayhawks received five first-place votes, marking their highest preseason ranking since the conference adopted a non-divisional format. The optimism is justified, as Kansas has made back-to-back bowl appearances and posted a 9-4 record in 2023, their best since 2007. With Coach Lance Leipold at the helm and quarterback Jalon Daniels leading the charge, the Jayhawks are positioned as legitimate contenders in the Big 12.\n\nColorado's return to the Big 12 is highlighted by the presence of Coach Prime. Known for his charismatic and candid personality, Sanders is expected to draw significant media attention. This marks his first power-conference media days appearance, as he missed the 2023 Pac-12 Media Days due to surgery and was previously at Jackson State. Sanders' media sessions are anticipated to be lively, and his handling of the room will be closely watched. Colorado boasts standout players like Travis Hunter, a two-way star named the preseason Defensive Player of the Year, and quarterback Shedeur Sanders, Deion's son, who earned a spot on the All-Big 12 team. Despite a challenging 2023 season, the Buffaloes aim to make strides in their new conference.\n\nKansas State is another team to watch. They were close to topping the preseason poll, falling just 17 points behind Utah. Despite this, the Wildcats have not generated as much preseason hype. They lack representation on the preseason All-Big 12 team but are consistently included in top-25 projections. Much of their success will depend on the development of new starting quarterback Avery Johnson. Coach Chris Klieman's track record, including a Big 12 title in 2022, suggests that Kansas State could be a dark horse in the conference race.\n\nOklahoma State's running back Ollie Gordon II, the preseason Offensive Player of the Year and a unanimous All-Big 12 selection, faces uncertainty following his recent arrest for driving under the influence. This incident casts a shadow over his otherwise stellar career, which includes winning the 2023 Doak Walker Award and finishing seventh in Heisman Trophy voting. Coach Mike Gundy will likely face questions about Gordon's status during media days, and his responses could provide insight into Gordon's availability for the 2024 season.\n\nThe departure of Texas and Oklahoma from the Big 12 marks the end of an era. These two programs have been dominant forces in the conference, winning seven of the last nine titles. Their absence creates a power vacuum that several schools will be eager to fill. The realignment of the conference, coupled with the new 12-team College Football Playoff format, adds an extra layer of intrigue to the season. The team that emerges victorious in the Big 12 will secure an automatic spot in the playoff, raising the stakes even higher.\n\nThe intense heat in Las Vegas mirrors the heated competition that awaits in the Big 12. With so many teams vying for the top spot and the allure of a College Football Playoff berth, the upcoming season promises to be one of the most exciting in recent memory. The media days will set the tone, providing a glimpse into the strategies, ambitions, and personalities that will define the 2024 college football season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType":

How much will the shadow of departed members Oklahoma and Texas - schools that left for the SEC in 2024 - hang over the event? Will Colorado coach Deion Sanders be front and center?\n\nThe Big 12 is part of the Power 4 along with the ACC, Big Ten and SEC - and there are several interesting storylines heading into the event. Here is a look at how to watch the event - and what to watch for the next two days.\n\nMORE: Who is in what conference in 2024 | Super League next?\n\nBig 12 Media Days will be televised on ESPNU from 1 p.m. ET to 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday and 1:30 p.m. ET to 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The event also can be streamed on ESPN+, Fubo and YouTubeTV.\n\nMORE: Top 25 coaches for 2024 | Top 25 quarterbacks\n\nCommissioner Brett Yormark will open Big 12 Media Days by addressing the media at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Eight coaches will speak to the media on Tuesday and players will be available to the media over the next two days. A look at that schedule.\n\nThe following players also will be available at Big 12 Media Days:\n\nYormark enters his third season as the Big 12 commissioner - a tenure that has been marked with aggressive moves in realignment and marketing. The Big 12 reportedly was exploring the possibility of selling the naming rights of its conference - and Yormark likely will address that Tuesday. The conference also added BYU, Cincinnati, Houston and UCF in 2023 and Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah in 2024. That has created the perception of parity within the conference. Will there be more realignment rumors in the near future? How will that be viewed in the 12-team College Football Playoff era? The Big 12 will have its championship game at AT&T Stadium - a contract that runs through 2030. Will there be any surprise news from Yormark ahead of his news conference?\n\nOklahoma State compiled an 89-41 record in the four-team College Football Playoff era, which was the second best in the conference behind Oklahoma at 102-29. With the Sooners gone, the Cowboys and longtime coach Mike Gundy are an elder statesman of sorts in the conference. Oklahoma State also returns quarterback Alan Bowman and all five starting offensive lineman in front of Doak Walker Award winner Ollie Gordon, who was arrested on accusations of driving under the influence on July 1. Gundy likely will address that incident. It is a new opportunity for Oklahoma State with the Sooners and Longhorns gone. How do the Cowboys plan on taking advantage of it?\n\nMORE: SN's preseason Top 25 for 2024\n\nThe Utes were 86-40 the last 10 seasons in the Pac-12 and are the preseason favorites to win the Big 12 in their first season. Kyle Whittingham -- who is entering his 20th season with Utah - named defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley as the program's \"head coach in waiting.\" Utah has been a model of stability despite playing in the Mountain West Conference, Pac-12 and now Big 12 under Whittingham. Quarterback Cam Rising also is back for a seventh season, which adds intrigue for a team that flirted with a CFP berth on multiple occasions in the four-team era.\n\nMORE: Big 12 quarterback rankings\n\nDeion Sanders will open Day 2 of Big 12 Media Days, and Shedeur and Shilo Sanders are among the marquee players at the event. It's not a stretch to say Deion will be the main attraction among reporters given the hype that will follow the Buffaloes into his second season. Shedeur Sanders is in the conversation to be the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Colorado is coming off a highly-publicized 4-8 season, and now the school returns to the Big 12 - a conference it left after the 2010 season.

While the league's past national champions Oklahoma and Texas left for the Southeastern Conference, Yormark touted the additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah that make the Big 12 a 16-school league. He says it's the deepest football conference in the nation. Yormark said at football media days in Las Vegas on Tuesday that the league's top priority as a business is growth and creating value for its schools.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy says NCAA rushing champion Ollie Gordon II will not miss any games because of his recent arrest for suspicion of driving under the influence, then later had to clarify what he meant when discussing his decision. Gundy said Tuesday during Big 12 football media days that he made decisions based on what he thought was best for Oklahoma State, the football team and Gordon. The preseason Big 12 offensive player of the year posted a public apology on social media Monday, and attended Big 12 media days as scheduled. Gordon says it was important for him to face everything and not leave it to others to answer questions about him.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Utah has won 26 conference championships in five different leagues, most recently capturing two Pac-12 titles and appearing in four championship games during its 13 seasons in that league. Now the Utes are favored to win the Big 12 in their inaugural season in the league, according to the preseason media poll. Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said Tuesday at the league's media days that it's much different now for the Utes than when they went into the Pac-12 in 2011. He says they weren't on an even playing field then when going from the Mountain West to a Power Five league.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Kansas stars Mario Chalmers and Sherron Collins are among 16 ex-men's college basketball players have sued the NCAA and multiple conferences over the use of their names, images and likenesses in promoting and monetizing March Madness. Turner Sports Interactive, the Big East, Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and ACC also are defendants in the class-action lawsuit. The filing says March Madness generates close to $1 billion in annual revenue for the NCAA, but none has gone to the plaintiffs.\n\nUNDATED (AP) -- The NCAA remains embroiled in multiple legal cases. The organization represents more than 500,000 athletes at more than 1,100 schools. Court challenges have already upended college athletics and more changes could be on the way.\n\nIRVING, Texas (AP) -- Big 12 newcomer Utah has been picked to finish first in the expanded 16-team football conference this fall. The Utes got 20 of 61 first-place votes in the poll released Tuesday from the votes of media who cover the league. Kansas State got 19 first-place votes and was picked second, with last year's Big 12 runner-up Oklahoma State third with 14 first-place ballots. Pac-12 teams Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah officially became Big 12 members this week, at the same time that reigning Big 12 champion Texas and Oklahoma joined the Southeastern Conference.

Coming off a 4-8 season, Sanders is hoping to compete in a new conference with returning star quarterback Shedeur Sanders, his son, and two-way player Travis Hunter.\n\nWith the new additions to the conference, here's how many teams are in the Big 12:\n\nREQUIRED READING: Oklahoma State football RB Ollie Gordon II 'deeply sorry' after arrest on suspicion of DUI\n\nHow many teams are in the Big 12?\n\nThe Big 12's number in its name hasn't meant anything in some time, as the conference had 10 members until the 2023-24 sports calendar, when it added UCF, Cincinnati, BYU and Houston to increase its membership to 14 teams.\n\nThe Big 12 was once scheduled to have 12 teams for the 2024-25 sports year (with Oklahoma and Texas' departure), but was able to pry Colorado, Arizona, Arizona State and Utah from the Pac-12 to increase its membership to 16 teams.\n\nWhat teams joined the Big 12 for the 2024 season?\n\nFour teams joined the Big 12 ahead of the 2024-25 sports calendar: Colorado, Arizona, Arizona State and Utah, which joined the conference after the Pac-12 essentially disbanded.\n\nThe Pac-12 consists of two teams as of now, with Oregon State and Washington State both playing temporary slates against Mountain West teams in football for the 2024 season. The conference's downfall started USC and UCLA leaving for the Big Ten, followed shortly thereafter by Oregon and Washington.\n\nAfter Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and BYU left, that left only Stanford, Cal, Oregon State and Washington State. The Cardinal and Golden Bears then decided to join the ACC, leaving the Beavers and Cougars as the only remnants of the Pac-12.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Who will win the 2024 Big 12 football championship?

Helping pick apart the old Pac-12, the conference brings in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and Arizona State to help compensate for the historic loss of Texas and Oklahoma to the SEC this year.\n\nHere's what you need to know as Big 12 Media Days gets underway, with a preview of the full schedule and a look at the preseason football rankings.\n\n1:30 p.m. Las Vegas Bowl executive director and Bowl Season chairman John Saccenti.\n\nRumors circulated this offseason that the Big 12 may consider a name change to the conference as part of a prospective sponsorship deal that would bring the league more revenue.\n\nInsiders speculate such a deal would bring the Big 12 around $50 million per year in new money.\n\nAnd news of the Big 12's interest in a corporate sponsor comes as it was revealed the league is also reportedly exploring a potential investment from a European private equity fund that could bring the conference up to $1 billion in exchange for a 15 to 20 percent stake in the operation, per reports.\n\nOfficial remarks from the Big 12 on these subjects have been sparse, but it's likely that commissioner Brett Yormark will face questions on these topics.\n\nBoasting arguably the expanded Big 12's premier overall roster, the Utes are poised to make a run at the league title in their debut season. Media members gave Utah 20 first-place votes in the preseason rankings and the team, coming off two Pac-12 titles in the last three years, is loaded.\n\nCameron Rising returns to the quarterback position after missing last season with a knee injury, and he'll be joined by star tight end Brant Kuithe. Those two combined with transfer receiver Dorian Singer, make Utah a contender for the Big 12 and the expanded College Football Playoff.\n\nThe Wildcats fell one vote shy of tying Utah at first-place in the preseason media rankings, based on the strength of a program that has won 19 games under head coach Chris Klieman the last two years.\n\nWill Howard is gone, transferred to Ohio State, but the quarterback position looks stable with youngster Avery Johnson at the helm. He's short on experience, but put forward promising tape in his limited exposure, particularly in the bowl game.\n\nOklahoma State's star running back returns after leading college football in rushing a year ago, but that's likely not what will be discussed first when Gundy represents the program in Vegas.\n\nGordon, the preseason Offensive Player of the Year and only unanimous All-Big 12 selection, was arrested recently on suspicion of driving under the influence and over the speed limit.\n\nOSU said that Gordon will be on site to represent the Cowboys, a good sign concerning his status with the program, but we hope to learn more from both the player and his coach.\n\nOtherwise, the Pokes remain in contention for the Big 12 crown, placing third in the media poll with 14 first-place votes and returning key experience on both sides of the ball.\n\nThough this isn't Deion Sanders' first year in a Power conference, it will be his first attending the Media Days of one. Colorado's head coach didn't go to Pac-12 Media Days last year after having surgery and he was at Jackson State the year before that.\n\nCoach Prime is always appointment viewing and should once again own the room when taking questions about the state of his Buffaloes team, which underwent another major turnover thanks in large part to the transfer portal.\n\nBut two key foundations remain in place: Shedeur Sanders, the coach's son and the Buffs' dynamic quarterback, and two-way player Travis Hunter, a star at both wide receiver and defensive back. Both are among the best overall players nationally and on them Colorado's hopes largely depend.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [],

The season will get going in about a month and a half, and college football fans everywhere are eager for the new beginning. College football fever is rampant across the country as we get closer to the season, but also because of the new EA Sports NCAA 25 video game that will be coming out in mid July. All in all, it's an exciting time to be a college football fan, and one fan base that is excited for the season is Utah football fans. The Utes have a big season ahead of them.\n\nThis college football season is going to be a big one for a number of reasons. The sport is going through big changes, and some of those changes are going to be seen for the first time this season. Let's take a look at what some of them are.\n\nFirst off, there are going to be some new rules seen this year in college football, and some fans aren't really in favor of them. Perhaps the biggest change is the addition of the two-minute warning. Fans have already started getting sick at all of the commercials that are happening in today's era of college football, and the two-minute warning is another way for tv networks to get more commercial times in.\n\nThe bigger changes, however, come with conference realignment and the expanded College Football Playoff. College football is going to look completely different next year because of those two things. California schools playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference? Yeah, things are changing.\n\nConference realignment has shaken things up big time in college football. The power five is no longer a thing as the Pac-12 is essentially dead. Every team left for a new conference except for Oregon State and Washington State. Those two teams have scheduling alliances with the Mountain West.\n\nEvery other Pac-12 school found a new home. Utah, Colorado, Arizona and Arizona State are now in the Big 12. Oregon, Oregon State, USC and UCLA joined the Big Ten. Lastly, Cal and Stanford joined the ACC (makes a ton of sense, right?).\n\nThe other big change with conferences comes in the SEC. Oklahoma and Texas are both leaving the Big 12 and they will join the SEC. The Big Ten and the SEC are loaded with good teams and seem on the verge of forming two super conferences.\n\nThis season, we will also see 12 teams make the College Football Playoff. For about a month, the College Football Playoff will be happening. Some people aren't in favor of the big expansion, but there will be more marquee college football games, and it's hard to be too upset about that.\n\nAll in all, this is going to be one of the biggest college football seasons of all time. The game is changing, and this is the start of a new era.\n\nUtah football is making their Big 12 debut\n\nUtah football is one of those Pac-12 teams that has found a new home, and they are going to the Big 12. The Utes are newcomers in the Big 12, and they are already the favorite to win the conference. Now that Texas and Oklahoma are gone, a lot of the fire power is out of the conference. It is pretty open in 2024, and Utah seems to have a good chance to win it with quarterback Cam Rising leading the way.\n\nOne interesting thing to keep an eye on heading into this season for Utah football is head coach Kyle Whittingham. The current situation with him is one that is not often seen in sports. He is still the head coach of the Utes, but he has made it clear that he could retire before the season ends, or before it starts. When it inevitably happens, defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley will take over.\n\nThe head coaching situation is certainly something to keep an eye on for the Utes, but they should be in good hands no matter what. They have a lot of talent on the team, and having Cam Rising back from injury is huge.\n\nUtah football has a lot of potential for the 2024 season. Here are three reasons why they will end up winning the Big 12 this season.\n\nCam Rising\n\nHaving Cam Rising back is going to be the difference this year. The Utes had a championship-caliber defense last season, but without good QB play, they just couldn't get it done on offense, and that plagued them. Rising is going to be one of the most experienced QBs in college football, and the Utes should be much better on offense with him leading the way. He threw for over 3,000 yards and tossed 26 touchdowns and just eight picks in 2022. It was a good year, and he should be able to find success this season in the Big 12, which is a weaker conference than others.\n\nDefense\n\nDefense was the strength of this Utah football team last year, and they should have a solid unit again in 2024. You know what they say, defense wins championships. If this unit is even as close to as good as it was last year, the Utes should be able to take care of business in the Big 12 if they get just decent QB play out of Rising.\n\nSchedule\n\nNo offense to the Big 12, but it is not a good conference. It wasn't that strong before, and now that Texas and Oklahoma are gone, it's really just not very good. Utah football has an incredibly easy schedule. The only team that they play that will for sure be ranked in the preseason top-25 is Oklahoma State, and Arizona likely will be too. However, who knows how the Wildcats will be without Jedd Fisch. He seemed to be the reason for their rapid turnaround.\n\nAll in all, the Utes have an incredibly easy schedule. If your toughest games are Oklahoma State and Arizona, there's a good chance that you can be successful. Utah football could very well end up going 12-0 in the regular season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In the Longhorns' and Sooners' absence, conference powerhouse status is up for grabs this year, and several schools seem primed to take it.\n\nFive different programs received first-place votes, with a tight race between Utah and Kansas State determining the top spot and Oklahoma State not far behind. Behind those, newcomer Arizona and newcomer to football relevance Kansas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy comparison, Oklahoma earned its ninth year atop the poll in an 11-year span in 2021, earning a vast majority of votes in those years in addition to six conference championships. After a competitive 2022, Texas was picked first in 2023 by a large margin and went on to win the Big 12 title.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so much change, this season is poised to be more unpredictable.\n\nA new sheriff in town\n\nThe Utes topped the preseason poll, and its easy to see why. Utah earned two straight Pac-12 titles prior to an injury-riddled 2023 and won its division three of six years before that. If any school is the favorite to fill the power vacuum, it's Utah.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the immediate, the Utes get back several key players, including starting quarterback Cameron Rising and tight end Brant Kuithe, who both missed the entirety of last season to injuries. Both will speak on Tuesday. Rising was the Pac-12 championship game MVP in 2022 and an all-conference first-team selection in 2021. Kuithe earned second-team honors from 2019-21 before a torn ACL sidelined him after four games in 2022.\n\nIn the long-term, Utah recently announced that defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley, entering his ninth year in the role, was named the successor to Kyle Whittingham, the program's all-time winningest head coach. Though there is not date set for Whittingham's retirement yet, the move gives Utah a stability and continuity of philosophy that is a hot commodity in today's college football world.\n\nOklahoma State running back Ollie Gordon II in attendance after arrest\n\nRunning back Ollie Gordon II had a breakout season last year, earning Big 12 offensive player of the year and winning the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best running back. However, the 20-year-old was reportedly arrested last week on suspicion of DUI. On the same day the arrest was reported, the conference announced media day attendees, and Gordon was on the list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2010, Cowboys star receiver Justin Blackmon was also arrested for DUI at 20 years old and was suspended one game before an incredibly successful season.\n\nChip on Dave Aranda's shoulder\n\nThis year is a make-or-break year for the Baylor Bears' coaching staff led by Dave Aranda. After going 2-9 in Aranda's first season at the helm, the Bears won the conference championship in 2021. However, the Bears have taken a sharp turn since, finishing 3-9 overall (2-7 Big 12) last year. Baylor overhauled its assistant staff with six new hires, four on offense, for the upcoming season. If the Bears can't get something going, this week's media days could be Aranda's last.\n\nThe Bears' offense finished 95th in the country in scoring last year. Retooling it will primarily fall to Aranda's new assistants, though weapons are scarce. Baylor tied for fewest All-Big 12 selections last season, including none to the first or second team. Baylor brought in a Class of 2024 and transfer recruiting class ranked 53rd in the nation consisting entirely of three-stars, except for former Toledo quarterback Dequan Finn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAranda, meanwhile, will focus on a defense that ranked 122nd in the nation in opponent points per game in 2023. He presented a plan to Baylor's athletic director on why he was the right head coach for the program at the end of last season, according to the Waco Tribune-Herald. He will be calling plays like he did as defensive coordinator for the 2019 LSU team that won the national championship.\n\nIf that decision pays off, Aranda's seat may cool off. But for the time being, he's surely feeling the heat.\n\nAdvertisementWelcome to the club\n\nTwo head coaches will get their first taste of power conference media next week: Arizona's Brent Brennan and Houston's Willie Fritz. The pair are entering their first years at their schools after leading Group of Five programs to national relevance.\n\nBrennan brought San Jose State to its first ever Mountain West title game appearance in 2020, which it won for the program's first conference championship since 1991. Brennan was named national coach of the year by the Lombardi Foundation, and the Spartans finished the season just inside the AP top 25.\n\nIn 2022, under Fritz, Tulane won the AAC championship and notched 12 wins, including a barn burner Cotton Bowl win over eighth-ranked Southern California. The previous year's team had won just two games, and the turnaround marked the biggest year-to-year improvement in NCAA football history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham and Colorado's Deion Sanders each enter their second year at their respective schools, and will both have questions to answer about their disappointing inaugural seasons.\n\nRelated

Utah, one of the four newcomers to the conference. The Utes earned 906 points (including 20 first-place votes) in this year's media poll, and should be a force all season.\n\nMORE: Deion at Media Day | Top 25 rankings | Playoff/bowl game predictions\n\nKansas State (19 first-place votes) and Oklahoma State (14 first-place votes) finished second and third in the poll. Kansas and Arizona, the latter of whom is new to the Big 12 this year, rounded out the media poll's top five teams. The Jayhawks earned five first-place votes, while the Wildcats finished with three.\n\nLet's get to DraftKings' full futures board for the 2024 odds to win the Big 12, and unveil our best bet to win this new-look powerhouse conference.\n\nHere's a look at the updated odds to win the Big 12 in 2024. With 2023 champion Texas moving to the SEC, the early leader is Utah followed by Kansas State and Oklahoma State.\n\nKyle Whittingham enters his 20th season as the Utes' head coach, and his first year in the Big 12 could be a massive campaign for his legacy. Many analysts already list Utah as a dark horse to win the NCAA national championship game, so +320 conference odds should surprise nobody.\n\nThere's plenty for Utes fans to be optimistic about this season. QB Cameron Rising and tight end Brant Kuithe should be back from their respective injuries, and wideout Dorian Singer joins an elite stable of pass-catchers. This should be a very fun team to watch and bet on.\n\nConsidering the Big 12 now has a whopping 16 teams, the Utes' schedule actually worked out quite nicely for them. It's entirely possible Utah runs the table this season, but it's difficult to see Whittingham's squad mounting wins in OK State and UCF. As far as the conference title is concerned, though, this is easily the best bet.\n\nMORE: Will Big 12 sell naming rights to Allstate?\n\nArizonas lost head coach Jedd Fisch to the University of Washington this offseason, but the Wildcats will still have stud QB Noah Fifita and elite receiver Tetairoa McMillan.\n\nFour incredibly challenging road games will put serious pressure on new coach Brent Brennan, but this team has enough talent to consider +1000 a superb value play.\n\nLook at that barrage of key games, and then reconsider your long-shot bet on Deion Sanders' Buffaloes. Everyone gets it -- Colorado is one of the most entertaining teams to watch on and off the field. But cool stories and larger-than-life coaches don't always make for good futures bets.\n\nQB Shadeur Sanders is awesome, and the Buffaloes improved their d-line and secondary this offseason. However, this offense has a lot of growing to do in a realigned conference, and Colorado probably doesn't have enough stability to overcome a daunting road schedule and battle for the conference.",

The conference's downfall started USC and UCLA leaving for the Big Ten, followed shortly thereafter by Oregon and Washington.\n\nAfter Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and BYU left, that left only Stanford, Cal, Oregon State and Washington State.

Two weeks after Pac-12 Media Day, a majority of the conference's members officially began their farewell tour with the plan to join other power conferences, including the Big Ten and Big 12; Stanford and Cal announced their plans to join the ACC a month later.\n\nLess than a year later, Arizona is returning to Las Vegas as a member of the Big 12. Sort of. Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah officially on-board the 16-team Big 12 on Aug. 2.\n\nPeople are also reading...

After a 10-3 season that resulted in a win at the Alamo Bowl, the Wildcats return their nucleus and a majority of their starters from the 2023 squad despite former head coach Jedd Fisch leaving for Washington.\n\nFirst-year Arizona head coach Brent Brennan, after seven seasons at San Jose State, takes the reins of a UA football program entering potentially the most highly anticipated season in years.\n\nAhead of the Big 12 Media Days on Tuesday and Wednesday at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, with the Wildcats on the main stage Wednesday afternoon, here are notable Arizona- and conference-related storylines:\n\nWithout Oklahoma and Texas, who is top dog? Which team will represent the Big 12 in the CFP?\n\nIn football, the Big 12 lost its headliner acts to the SEC: Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nSince the Big 12 played its first conference championship game in 1996, Oklahoma and Texas have combined to win 18 league titles -- 14 of them courtesy of OU, which ended its Big 12 membership with a loss to Arizona at the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio in December.\n\nCurrent Big 12 teams with the most conference titles include Baylor and Kansas State (3), along with Colorado, Oklahoma State and TCU with one apiece.\n\nWhich program could potentially reign the conference this season and beyond? The Utah Utes, a potential Top 10 team this season, were voted to win the conference in the preseason media poll, ahead of Kansas State, Oklahoma State and Kansas. Arizona was voted fifth in the conference preseason poll, with Iowa State, West Virginia, UCF, Texas Tech and TCU rounding out the top 10; ASU was picked last.\n\nUtah returns 25-year-old super-senior and star quarterback Cameron Rising, who has 5,572 passing yards, 46 touchdowns, just 14 interceptions, to go along with 953 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. Between Rising, running back Micah Bernard, tight end Brant Kuithe and former UA receiver Dorian Singer, who transferred from USC this offseason, along with a defense that returns a majority of its starters, Utah could make a splash in its inaugural year in the Big 12.\n\nArizona faces Utah in Salt Lake City to begin Big 12 play on Sept. 28, after a nonconference game against Kansas State in Manhattan on Friday, Sept. 13.\n\nArizona has six games against Big 12 opponents that were voted in the bottom half of the preseason Big 12 poll: Texas Tech (9), at TCU (10), Colorado (11), at BYU (13), Houston (15) and Arizona State (16). Arizona wouldn't have to potentially face Oklahoma State, Kansas or Iowa State until the Big 12 championship game in Dallas.\n\nBarring injuries at key positions, Arizona will be favored in most of its games this season, and if the Wildcats can withstand road tests at Kansas State, Utah and UCF in Orlando for the \"Space Game,\" they have a path to the Big 12 title game -- and the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff.\n\nBeyond this season, deep-pocketed boosters and alumni and powerful NIL collectives will likely have an influence on that.\n\nCan T-Mac stamp legacy with record-breaking season?\n\nArizona star receiver Tetairoa McMillan enters his third season as one of the top pass-catchers in college football with several All-American honors, and he's arguably already the greatest player at the position in UA history.\n\nMcMillan, who will be one of four player representatives for Arizona at Big 12 Media Day, needs 1,248 yards this season to become the school's all-time receiving yards leader, passing his current UA wide receivers coach, Bobby Wade.\n\nMcMillan, along with longtime friend and teammate in quarterback Noah Fifita, who is also speaking at media day, lead an Arizona offense that is expected to be amongst the most productive units this season. This season will most likely be McMillan's last year before he becomes a likely first-round choice in the NFL Draft, which would be the second straight year a Wildcat was drafted in the first round.\n\nIn a one-on-one drill with cornerback Tacario Davis during spring practices, McMillan suffered a leg injury and \"had a little procedure\" in April, \"and we expect him back for the season,\" according to Brennan. McMillan is now \"moving along and progressing great,\" Arizona's head coach recently told the Star. McMillan is expected to not have limitations at the start of training camp, which starts on July 30.\n\nIs this season a make-or-break year for Colorado, Prime?\n\nDespite a strong start, the \"Coach Prime\" sizzle at Colorado under head coach Deion Sanders tapered off last season, and the Buffaloes finished 4-8.\n\nIn his second season at the helm, Sanders revamped Colorado's roster with Louis Vuitton luggage -- err, players from the transfer portal to surround his two star assets in son and star quarterback Shedeur Sanders and CU two-way star Travis Hunter, who both transferred with Prime from Jackson State last year.\n\nBoth Sanders and and Hunter will enter the NFL Draft after this season. It will also be the last year for the older Sanders' other son, free safety Shilo Sanders, who recently filed for bankruptcy and is $11 million in debt.\n\nAfter adding 42 transfers this offseason, including nine offensive linemen, plus five-star offensive tackle Jordan Seaton, Colorado will either contend for a bowl game or continue to be all sizzle and no steak.\n\nIs Fifita the most underrated QB in the conference?\n\nFifita had the third-most passing yards last season among current Big 12 quarterbacks behind Oklahoma State's Alan Bowman and Sanders.\n\nFifita, who was also the Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year and Football Writer's Association of American National Offensive Freshman of the Year, concluded his first season as Arizona's starter with 2,869 yards, 25 touchdowns and six interceptions while completing 72.4% of his pass attempts. The Huntington Beach, California native is the only UA quarterback in program history to complete over 70% of his passes in a season.\n\nFifita went 7-2 as Arizona's starter, and led the Wildcats on a seven-game winning streak to end the season; the two losses to Washington and USC were by a combined nine points.\n\nAlthough Fifita didn't earn preseason All-Big 12 honors, he's earned Heisman Trophy odds. He has the second-highest odds (+4,000) amongst Big 12 quarterbacks behind Kansas' Jalon Daniels.\n\nWill the Big 12 continue to grow?\n\nUA president Robert C. Robbins lauded Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark, who will hold a news conference at Allegiant Stadium on Tuesday at 10 a.m., last year for his \"very aggressive\" approach with adding Arizona and other schools to the Big 12.\n\nWill the Big 12 continue to add more schools beyond this year? Florida State and Clemson are suing the ACC to potentially avoid outlandish exit fees from the conference with its grant of rights that expires in 2036.\n\n\"We explore every and all opportunity to create value for our members, for our student-athletes,\" Yormark said in May. \"It's what we've been doing since I on-boarded and we'll continue to have that mindset.\"\n\nYormark added: \"I've said from Day 1, we are open for business. I guess you could say that we are open for business now more than ever before.\"\n\nWill Arizona's new-look defense complement the offense?\n\nGood news and bad news for Arizona's defense.\n\nThe good news: Arizona returns most of its defensive secondary, including potential first-round draft choice Tacario Davis and safety Gunner Maldonado, who will attend Big 12 Media Day. Preseason All-Big 12 linebacker Jacob Manu, who will also be in Las Vegas this week, leads an Arizona defense that will have a similar 4-2-5 base scheme under first-year defensive coordinator Duane Akina, who was a defensive backs assistant under former play-caller Johnny Nansen.\n\nThe bad news? Arizona will have to replace nine scholarship defensive linemen a year after the Wildcats used the transfer portal to bolster the front-six unit and boost Arizona's defense to a consistent run-stopper.\n\nIn addition to multiple rising defensive linemen, including likely starter Ta'ita'i Uiagalelei, the Wildcats added seven defensive linemen in the transfer portal. If Arizona's defensive line can complement the rest of the defense -- and ultimately the rest of the team, Arizona could double-down on another double-digit win season.\n\nContact Justin Spears, the Star's Arizona football beat reporter, at jspears@tucson.com.

Half the Big 12 can make a case to win the conference and receive the all-important bid for the College Football Playoff.\n\nHere are my preseason power rankings, awards picks and all-conference team:\n\nPower Rankings\n\n1. Utah\n\nThis is essentially a vote of confidence in Kyle Whittingham, who is tied with Mike Gundy as the second-longest tenured coach in college football. It's still smart to bet on the Utes with all the success they've had in recent years. QB Cam Rising and TE Brant Kuithe return from injury and give Utah two all-conference caliber offensive weapons. USC transfer WR Dorian Singer will be a boost, as well.\n\n2. Oklahoma State\n\nSpeaking of Gundy, the Cowboys are probably the biggest name left from the old Big 12 now that Oklahoma and Texas have departed for the SEC. OK State has arguably the best running back in the country in Ollie Gordon II (more on him in a bit) and an experienced lineup that returns the second-most starters in the nation and should be a serious threat to win the Big 12.\n\n3. Kansas State\n\nThe Wildcats have an experienced defense with a Player of the Year candidate in linebacker Austin Moore, plus a young quarterback with loads of potential in Avery Johnson. Chris Klieman is another coach worth betting on in the Big 12.\n\n4. Iowa State\n\nAnother team that ranks in the top five in the country in number of returning starters, this could be the year coach Matt Campbell gets his Cyclones to break through and win the Big 12. If Iowa State does so, it'll be on the backs of its veteran defense, led by my pick for conference Player of the Year in safety Jeremiah Cooper.\n\n5. Arizona\n\nThere's a good chance they're at the top of this list if Jedd Fisch doesn't take the Washington job somewhat late in the coaching cycle and take a handful of players with him to Seattle. Still, Arizona and new coach Brent Brennan, who came from San Jose State, managed to keep big stars QB Noah Fifita and WR Tetairoa McMillan. The latter may be the best in the country at his position, and this roster is talented enough to compete for a conference title.\n\n6. West Virginia\n\nThe Mountaineers have arguably the best left tackle in the Big 12 in Wyatt Milum and a quarterback in Garrett Greene who took a big step forward in leading WVU to its first nine-win season since 2016. Not bad for a team picked to finish dead last in the conference in 2023.\n\n7. Colorado\n\nI get it. The Buffs won only four games last year (which I predicted, by the way) and had another offseason of turnover on the roster, although not as drastic as Deion Sanders' first in Boulder. But CU has the preseason all-conference pick at QB in Shedeur Sanders and preseason Defensive Player of the Year in Travis Hunter. The talent around them should be much better in 2024 and it should lead to a lot more wins in a conference that's not as good as the Pac-12 in 2023.\n\n8. Kansas\n\nThe Big 12 has some of the most underrated quarterbacks in the country, but the Jayhawks' Jalon Daniels might top the list. Injuries have derailed parts of each of his last two seasons, but Daniels is as dynamic as they come and has a proven knack for winning football games. Coach Lance Leipold has a challenge on his hands in replacing offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki, who left for Penn State.\n\n9. Texas Tech\n\nSpeaking of underrated players, the Red Raiders have a legit candidate to win Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year in Tahj Brooks, who isn't mentioned as often as Gordon II in the conversation for top running backs. Brooks is enough to give Texas Tech a solid offense. Five-star wide receiver Micah Hudson could be an instant game-changer, as well.\n\n10. Central Florida\n\nArkansas transfer QB KJ Jefferson instantly raises both the floor and the ceiling for the Knights in their second season in a power conference. He and talented running back RJ Harvey give coach Gus Malzahn a potent rushing duo.\n\n11. Texas Christian\n\nAs expected, the Horned Frogs couldn't live up to their run to the national championship game last fall, missing out on a bowl game. There's plenty of pieces to replace on the offensive line and at the skill positions, but Sonny Dykes deserves credit for how he's rebuilt rosters. He's also brought in former Boise State coach Andy Avalos to be his defensive coordinator.\n\n12. Baylor\n\nIt's a make-or-break season for coach Dave Aranda, who's led the Bears to just nine wins across the last two seasons after winning 12 and a Big 12 championship in 2021. Baylor has an intriguing QB transfer in Toledo's Daequan Finn, but none of that will matter if the defense doesn't take a massive step forward.\n\n13. Arizona State\n\nLosing promising freshman Jaden Rashada to Georgia was a big blow for coach Kenny Dillingham in his second offseason in Tempe. It was never going to be a quick rebuild for him and the Sun Devils, who are likely staring down another season without a bowl game this fall.\n\n14. BYU\n\nAll four teams that joined the Big 12 last season had their fare of struggles, and those are likely to continue for BYU and coach Kalani Sitake in 2024. The Cougars could be facing a second-straight losing season for the first time in 20 years.\n\n15. Cincinnati\n\nCoach Scott Satterfield didn't find it easy in his first season with the Bearcats after leaving Louisville. Cincinnati is still trying to find the talent it had when it made back-to-back New Year's Six bowl games (including a trip to the College Football Playoff) in 2020 and 2021.\n\n16. Houston\n\nCoach Wille Fritz is coming off a long, successful run at Tulane but has his work cut out for him at Houston. This is likely going to be a longer rebuild for the Cougars, who are well behind much of the conference in terms of talent.\n\nAwards Predictions\n\nOffensive Player of the Year\n\nOklahoma State RB Ollie Gordon II\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5\n\nGame analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up\n\nView all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess! Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nView all of our newsletters.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nGordon's status for the start of the season is somewhat up in the air after his arrest on suspicion of a DUI earlier this month. He apologized for the incident on \"X\" and seemingly will still attend Big 12 media days this week in Las Vegas. Regardless, he's the most talented offensive player in the conference and was the only unanimous preseason all-Big 12 selection for a reason after rushing for over 1,700 yards and 21 touchdowns last season.\n\nOthers to watch: Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders, Texas Tech RB Tahj Brooks, Arizona WR Tetairoa McMillan\n\nDefensive Player of the Year\n\nIowa State DB Jeremiah Cooper\n\nThe Cyclones had the best defense in the Big 12 last season and Cooper was a big part of the equation with 45 tackles and five interceptions. He's one of the best players in pass coverage and another season of similar production should help ISU be in conference title contention.\n\nOthers to watch: Kansas State LB Austin Moore, Oklahoma State LB Nick Martin, Arizona LB Jacob Manu\n\nNewcomer of the Year\n\nColorado CB/WR Travis Hunter\n\nGiven the talent on the four teams that joined the conference this summer, this category is loaded with potential winners, but Hunter deserves the nod. I voted him preseason all-Big 12 at both cornerback and wide receiver and expect him to make a huge impact on both ends once again. His natural instincts in pass coverage are out of this world. Who knows the offensive numbers he would've put up last season had he not gotten hurt in Week 3 and missed three games?\n\nOthers to watch: Arizona WR Tetairoa McMillan, Utah TE Brant Kuithe, UCF QB KJ Jefferson,\n\nKing's preseason all-Big 12 Team\n\nOffense\n\nQB Shedeur Sanders, Colorado\n\nRB Ollie Gordon II, Oklahoma State\n\nRB Tahj Brooks, Texas Tech\n\nFB Stevo Klotz, Iowa State\n\nWR Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona\n\nWR Brennan Presley, Oklahoma State\n\nWR Travis Hunter, Colorado\n\nTE Brant Kuithe, Utah\n\nOL Jarrod Hufford, Iowa State\n\nOL Luke Kandra, Cincinnati\n\nOL Gavin Gerhardt, Cincinnati\n\nOL Davion Carter, Texas Tech\n\nOL Wyatt Milum, West Virginia\n\nDefense\n\nDL B.J.

It's a topic that has drawn a lot of discussion, debate, and even some ire with the old guard (understandably so) that should drive a lot of the conversation during the two-day event.\n\nWhile that may be the topic that dominates the media's time in Las Vegas, the Utes have some other interesting topics of conversation that will likely come up as well.\n\nCheck out what we believe will be the top five topics discussed at Big 12 Media Days concerning Utah football in 2024.\n\nThis topic most likely won't take up a lot of time for Utah football but will be the first that's dived into.\n\nFor those that missed it, there was an official announcement last week that Morgan Scalley has been named Kyle Whittingham's heir apparent for whenever he chooses to retire.\n\nThis wasn't exactly Earth-shattering news for those who cover or follow Utah football closely, but it certainly sparks a lot of curiosity about the \"who, what, when, where, and whys\" of the timing.\n\nSome things we think we do know is that the issue was forced after USC fired defensive coordinator Alex Grinch last season and went after Scalley hard to be his replacement.\n\nIt also has felt like current recruits may have had some questions about what the future of Utah football would look like if they chose to go there and what plans the Utes had for when and if Whittingham retires. Naturally, naming Scalley as \"coach in waiting\" gives some assurances that many of the things that are attractive about Utah to recruits will stay intact if Whitt retires during their time in the program.\n\nWe expect some questions out of the gate about the timeline on the decision and the reasoning behind it. We also won't be surprised if someone doesn't try to get Whittingham to put a timeline on when he might call it a career. (He won't give a solid answer on that either way.)\n\nThis would have been the first topic if the news about Scalley hadn't come out, but we are sure the majority of the discussions surrounding Utah will involve them being picked first in the Big 12 by the media.\n\nOn paper, Utah looks good. Really good, so it makes a lot of sense there would be confidence that this team could make a splash despite being in a new conference.\n\nThe interesting parts of this discussion topic likely won't come from the Utes though. Whittingham and the Utes will keep tight lips on the topic and instead turn the focus on needing to put in the work to make it happen rather than simply expecting it to be so.\n\nLook for the interesting comments to come from their conference mates- an interesting mix of teams that know Whittingham and Utah very well, and teams that are trying their best to learn as much as possible about them.\n\nHealth was a huge issue for the Utes in 2023 with estimates of 38-40 players being affected by significant injuries. (If those estimates truly are accurate, Utah was roughly operating without the equivalent of their starting offensive and defensive units plus their second-string units...woof...)\n\nAll eyes were particularly focused on quarterback Cam Rising and tight end Brant Kuithe through the whole ordeal with fans desperately waiting for their return till they pulled the plug on 2023 about the middle of October.\n\nDespite all of that, Utah still finished with a winning record going against what turned out to be a very strong Pac-12. It was hard not to be impressed even with some rougher than usual performances.\n\nObviously, 2024 is a new year with new opportunities and there will be some curiosity from fans and media alike as to how Rising and Kuithe are feeling (they will both be at Big 12 Media Days) along with the overall health of the Utah football team.\n\nThere are a lot of familiar, returning faces for the Utes in 2024- it's a large factor into why they were voted by media to finish first in the Big 12.\n\nHowever, there will be some new faces in the mix as well, particularly in the secondary and wide receiver groups that will draw some interest and even questions heading into the season.\n\nThose familiar with Utah football know that anytime there is NFL turnover on the defense it's only a matter of \"reloading\". That's basically what the Utes are facing with their DBs in 2024 with cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn boasting the most overall playtime for the Utes.\n\nThe wide receivers are a bit of a different story. It's not so much about \"reloading\" for Utah as it is trying to strengthen what has felt like a perpetual weakness for an overall solid team.\n\nLook for some interesting, more niche \"Jimmy and Joes\" conversations surrounding guys like Georgia Tech transfer cornerback Kenan Johnson, or USC transfer wide receiver Dorian Singer along with some guys who have been in the program for a while like Smith Snowden, Tao Johnson, and Money Parks.\n\nThe media will be hard put to get the Utes to elaborate a ton on being voted top dog preseason in the Big 12, but they should be able to get some initial thoughts on being a part of a new conference.\n\nWhich teams are the players most excited to face? Particularly of the teams they don't have as much familiarity with? Venues they are chomping at the bit to play in? Peers they are looking forward to face off against?\n\nWhat conversations are you most excited about surrounding Utah in their first Big 12 Media Days appearance?

The season will get going in about a month and a half, and college football fans everywhere are eager for the new beginning. College football fever is rampant across the country as we get closer to the season, but also because of the new EA Sports NCAA 25 video game that will be coming out in mid July. All in all, it's an exciting time to be a college football fan, and one fan base that is excited for the season is Utah football fans. The Utes have a big season ahead of them.\n\nThis college football season is going to be a big one for a number of reasons. The sport is going through big changes, and some of those changes are going to be seen for the first time this season. Let's take a look at what some of them are.\n\nFirst off, there are going to be some new rules seen this year in college football, and some fans aren't really in favor of them. Perhaps the biggest change is the addition of the two-minute warning. Fans have already started getting sick at all of the commercials that are happening in today's era of college football, and the two-minute warning is another way for tv networks to get more commercial times in.\n\nThe bigger changes, however, come with conference realignment and the expanded College Football Playoff. College football is going to look completely different next year because of those two things. California schools playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference? Yeah, things are changing.\n\nConference realignment has shaken things up big time in college football. The power five is no longer a thing as the Pac-12 is essentially dead. Every team left for a new conference except for Oregon State and Washington State. Those two teams have scheduling alliances with the Mountain West.\n\nEvery other Pac-12 school found a new home. Utah, Colorado, Arizona and Arizona State are now in the Big 12. Oregon, Oregon State, USC and UCLA joined the Big Ten. Lastly, Cal and Stanford joined the ACC (makes a ton of sense, right?).\n\nThe other big change with conferences comes in the SEC. Oklahoma and Texas are both leaving the Big 12 and they will join the SEC. The Big Ten and the SEC are loaded with good teams and seem on the verge of forming two super conferences.\n\nThis season, we will also see 12 teams make the College Football Playoff. For about a month, the College Football Playoff will be happening. Some people aren't in favor of the big expansion, but there will be more marquee college football games, and it's hard to be too upset about that.\n\nAll in all, this is going to be one of the biggest college football seasons of all time. The game is changing, and this is the start of a new era.\n\nUtah football is making their Big 12 debut\n\nUtah football is one of those Pac-12 teams that has found a new home, and they are going to the Big 12. The Utes are newcomers in the Big 12, and they are already the favorite to win the conference. Now that Texas and Oklahoma are gone, a lot of the fire power is out of the conference. It is pretty open in 2024, and Utah seems to have a good chance to win it with quarterback Cam Rising leading the way.\n\nOne interesting thing to keep an eye on heading into this season for Utah football is head coach Kyle Whittingham. The current situation with him is one that is not often seen in sports. He is still the head coach of the Utes, but he has made it clear that he could retire before the season ends, or before it starts. When it inevitably happens, defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley will take over.\n\nThe head coaching situation is certainly something to keep an eye on for the Utes, but they should be in good hands no matter what. They have a lot of talent on the team, and having Cam Rising back from injury is huge.\n\nUtah football has a lot of potential for the 2024 season. Here are three predictions for their season.\n\nCam Rising will win the Heisman\n\nThis is certainly a bold take, but there is a ton of value here. Cam Rising is currently +4000 to win the Heisman. People forget that he was one of the better QBs in college football in 2022, the last season he played. Rising threw for over 3,000 yards and he tossed 26 touchdowns and eight picks. Heisman numbers? No, but, the Heisman has turned into a QB award. Most people agree that this is a down year for QBs, and Rising seems to be flying under the radar a bit. He has more experience than just about any other Heisman-caliber QB, and he is also going to be playing a pretty easy schedule. The toughest game the Utes is probably at Oklahoma State. Rising is going to have a lot of opportunities to put up big numbers.\n\nUtah football will win the Big 12\n\nThe Big 12 is, how do I put this delicately... not good. Utah football is the favorite in the conference and they are going to win it. The Utes have an incredibly easy schedule that truly could feature zero ranked teams. Oklahoma State is certainly their toughest opponent, and the Cowboys should be solid. However, if things don't pan out for Oklahoma State, there could legitimately be zero ranked teams on that schedule. Utah has no excuse to not win this conference.\n\nUtah football will lose in their first CFP game\n\nUtah football will get into the College Football Playoff for the first time this season as they will get an auto bid from winning the Big 12. However, because of that schedule, it's going to be hard to gauge really how good the Utes are. They had a tremendous defense last year, and with Cam Rising back, they should have a good offense this season. If the defense can have success again, this can be a very good team. However, their lack of competition in conference play will plague them when the College Football Playoff rolls around.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The season will get going in about a month and a half, and college football fans everywhere are eager for the new beginning. College football fever is rampant across the country as we get closer to the season, but also because of the new EA Sports NCAA 25 video game that will be coming out in mid July. All in all, it's an exciting time to be a college football fan, and one fan base that is excited for the season is Utah football fans. The Utes have a big season ahead of them.\n\nThis college football season is going to be a big one for a number of reasons. The sport is going through big changes, and some of those changes are going to be seen for the first time this season. Let's take a look at what some of them are.\n\nFirst off, there are going to be some new rules seen this year in college football, and some fans aren't really in favor of them. Perhaps the biggest change is the addition of the two-minute warning. Fans have already started getting sick at all of the commercials that are happening in today's era of college football, and the two-minute warning is another way for tv networks to get more commercial times in.\n\nThe bigger changes, however, come with conference realignment and the expanded College Football Playoff. College football is going to look completely different next year because of those two things. California schools playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference? Yeah, things are changing.\n\nConference realignment has shaken things up big time in college football. The power five is no longer a thing as the Pac-12 is essentially dead. Every team left for a new conference except for Oregon State and Washington State. Those two teams have scheduling alliances with the Mountain West.\n\nEvery other Pac-12 school found a new home. Utah, Colorado, Arizona and Arizona State are now in the Big 12. Oregon, Oregon State, USC and UCLA joined the Big Ten. Lastly, Cal and Stanford joined the ACC (makes a ton of sense, right?).\n\nThe other big change with conferences comes in the SEC. Oklahoma and Texas are both leaving the Big 12 and they will join the SEC. The Big Ten and the SEC are loaded with good teams and seem on the verge of forming two super conferences.\n\nThis season, we will also see 12 teams make the College Football Playoff. For about a month, the College Football Playoff will be happening. Some people aren't in favor of the big expansion, but there will be more marquee college football games, and it's hard to be too upset about that.\n\nAll in all, this is going to be one of the biggest college football seasons of all time. The game is changing, and this is the start of a new era.\n\nUtah football is making their Big 12 debut\n\nUtah football is one of those Pac-12 teams that has found a new home, and they are going to the Big 12. The Utes are newcomers in the Big 12, and they are already the favorite to win the conference. Now that Texas and Oklahoma are gone, a lot of the fire power is out of the conference. It is pretty open in 2024, and Utah seems to have a good chance to win it with quarterback Cam Rising leading the way.\n\nOne interesting thing to keep an eye on heading into this season for Utah football is head coach Kyle Whittingham. The current situation with him is one that is not often seen in sports. He is still the head coach of the Utes, but he has made it clear that he could retire before the season ends, or before it starts. When it inevitably happens, defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley will take over.\n\nThe head coaching situation is certainly something to keep an eye on for the Utes, but they should be in good hands no matter what. They have a lot of talent on the team, and having Cam Rising back from injury is huge.\n\nUtah football has a lot of potential for the 2024 season as they have a good amount of talent coming back. However, two of their best and most intriguing returners didn't even play last season.\n\nCam Rising, QB\n\nWe've already talked about Cam Rising a little bit, but he is the X-factor for this Utah football team in 2024. The Utes had a championship level defense in 2023 and it kept them in a lot of games, but their offense just wasn't able to score enough points in their most important games of the season. They missed Rising a lot, but he will be back this season.\n\nThe last season that Cam Rising played in was the 2022 season. He had a good year as he ended up throwing for over 3,000 yards, and he tossed 26 touchdown passes and only eight interceptions. He was unfortunately injured at the end of the year, and it caused him to miss all of last year. This recovery has taken awhile, but it should end up being worth the wait as Rising seems poised for a big 2024 season.\n\nBrant Kuithe, TE\n\nAnother player that the Utah football team missed last season is tight end Brant Kuithe. Kuithe is in a similar boat as Cam Rising. He tore his ACL during the 2022 season, and he had to miss all of last year. He is another extremely talented and experienced player that will be back with the Utes in 2024. He has been with the program since the 2018 season, so this will be his sixth year playing, and his seventh season in the program. The experience is certainly there.\n\nBefore getting injured, Brant Kuithe was having a lot of success with this Utah football team. His last full year was in 2021, and he hauled in 50 receptions for 611 yards and six touchdowns. He is a big part of this offense, and it will be huge for Utah to have him back this season.\n\nNot having Cam Rising and Brant Kuithe hurt this Utah football team a lot last year. Their offense is what held them back, but with Rising and Kuithe returning this year, the Utes should be good on that side of the ball if those two stay healthy.", "source": {"uri":

Discuss among yourselves.\n\nBaylor: Head coach Dave Aranda starts 2024 on the hot seat after back-to-back losing seasons and a 3-9 record in 2023.\n\nBYU: The Cougars went 1-5 on the road in their first year in Big 12. Not ideal.\n\nCincinnati: The Bearcats made the College Football Playoff in 2022 ... then went 1-8 in their first season in the Big 12 in 2023. How do you bounce back from that?\n\nColorado: So much hype. So much pressure. Shedeur Sanders, Travis Hunter and a clutch of talented transfers and recruits will begin the season in the spotlight once again.\n\nHouston: Longtime head coach Willie Fritz finally gets his shot at at Power Four program after delivering big at every previous stop in his career.\n\nIowa State: Cyclones could be surprise Big 12 contender and return almost the entire starting lineup from 2023.\n\nKansas: Lance Leipold has the Jayhawks being talked about as Big 12 contenders. Historically speaking that's no small feat.\n\nKansas State: All eyes will be on sophomore quarterback Avery Johnson, who Kansas State's coaching staff had enough faith in to let last year's starter, Will Howard, transfer to Ohio State.\n\nOklahoma State: The Cowboys return the nucleus of its team from last year, including Doak Walker Award winner Ollie Gordon II at running back. That should be the story but it won't be. It will be about Gordon's recent arrest for DUI.\n\nTCU: Sonny Dykes has one of the nation's best recruiting classes for 2025 but if the Horned Frogs go 5-7 again in 2024 ... can they keep them?\n\nTexas Tech: Incremental progress is one thing, but college football is not a place for patience. Winning 10 games would be a giant leap forward for third-year head coach Joey McGurie. The Red Raiders play two of their final three games at home -- Colorado on Nov. 9 and West Virginia in the regular-season finale on Nov. 30.\n\nUCF: Explain to us what the Knights have beyond quarterback K.J. Jefferson, who was a three-year starter at Arkansas before transferring to UCF.\n\nUtah: ThIs team warrants three questions: Is this longtime head coach Kyle Whittingham's final season? Is BYU-Utah automatically the Big 12's best rivalry? Can seventh-year QB Cam Rising regain his old form after injuries?\n\nWest Virginia: There's something to love about WVU quarterback Garrett Greene modeling his game after former Heisman Trophy winners Baker Mayfield and Johnny Manziel.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The reason for the detour was Big 12 Media Days at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, which started Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the first formal event in the new conference for the Sun Devils and three other former Pac-12 foes in Arizona, Utah and Colorado. The addition of those teams gives the Big 12 teams in 10 states stretching from one coast to another. Eight teams took turns on the main stage, then rotating to other media stops and promotional shoots around the floor of the stadium, which serves as home to the NFL's Raiders.\n\nThe conference issued 500 media credentials for the annual event, which began with an address and question and answer segment with commissioner Brett Yormark.\n\n\"I've been saying it for a year now, but the four corner (schools) was the 'A' scenario for us when we thought about realignment. Big brands, great markets, engaged fan bases, both academic and athletic excellence,\" he said. \"We got deeper and better in football. We got deeper and better in basketball and we got deeper and better in Olympic sports. So it's been a win for this conference and I'm thrilled and excited to officially welcome the four corners. As I said, they're here today, obviously. And I think we're in for something pretty special as a conference.\"\n\nWith the Big 12 swelling to 16 teams, it was necessary to stretch the event over two days. ASU's biggest rival, Arizona, is among the teams to be featured Wednesday.\n\nThe Pac-12, which held its 2023 media day in Las Vegas, featured each coach and two players from each team. But the Big 12 likes to go big as evidenced by the recent conference expansion. Four players accompanied each coach. A few even brought five.\n\nDillingham, appropriately dressed in a maroon suit, brought with him center Leif Fautanu, running back Cameron Skattebo, safety Xavion Alford and edge rusher Clayton Smith.\n\nBoth Alford and Smith hail from Texas and are excited about joining a conference that will take them closer to home on a regular basis.\n\nThe Sun Devils are looking to bounce back from a second straight 3-9 showing so the chance to play in a new conference could be something good.\n\n\"It's an honor to be selected by my coach to be here,\" Alford said. \"I'm excited about playing in the Big 12. Being from Texas I've already come across a bunch of players I know or have played against. There are going to be some great games. I know it's still new to a lot of people but it's like a fresh start so that's probably good for us.\"\n\nASU athletic director Graham Rossini was among his school representatives. He too was donning the school colors. Rossini, like Dillingham a graduate of the school with a vested interest in turning around the narrative surrounding the program, was formally appointed earlier this summer but has been working behind the scenes for several months.\n\n\"It's oddly familiar,\" he said of being in Las Vegas. \"We were on this field not that long ago, done a lot in Las Vegas over the years. It's a great place, easy access for our fans. So it is nice to see the familiar brands in U of A, Colorado and Utah alongside us in a setting we know well but then you recognize that this is different. We're all preparing for life in the Big 12. It's really exciting. We know that is in front of us and we want to make the most of this, how do we join this conference, how do we get a chance to be part of this national footprint and how easy it will be for our fans to watch us compete. It feels closer to getting real.\"\n\nASU starts the season Aug. 31, against Wyoming. Its first Big 12 game will come on Sept. 21, against Texas Tech in Lubbock.\n\n\"I'm excited about playing in all these unbelievable cities. Unbelievable atmospheres for our guys to play in,\" Dillingham said. \"I think tis is one of the best coached conferences in the country, top to bottom. I'm excited to be part of it.\"\n\nGordon appears\n\nAmong the other player appearing was running back Ollie Gordon II of Oklahoma State, a first team preseason pick and an athlete singled out by many as a potential conference player of the year. Gordon kept with the scheduled appearance despite an arrest on charges of suspicion of driving under the influence on June 30. He has publicly apologized and took responsibility for the incident.\n\nCoach Mike Gundy said the staff talked about whether or not the player should attend and decided to let him do so and answer questions as he saw fit. Once the event was over it would mark the end of discussion on that topic.\n\nGordon was named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year as a sophomore last season, tallying 1,732 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns on 285 carries.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type":

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2024 college football season will usher in a new era by introducing the 12-team College Football Playoff, replacing the previous four-team format. This will also give other teams that have not yet made the field a better opportunity to do so.\n\nA major reason for this is that it provides automatic bids to the champions of the Power Four conferences. In the past, a team that would have benefited from this system was the Utah Utes. Utah is still searching for its first appearance in the College Football Playoff despite winning the Pac-12 in 2021-22.\n\nNow that Utah is heading to the Big 12, many people believe the Utes have the potential to contend for the conference championship immediately and possibly reach its first College Football Playoff.\n\nJake Crain, the host of the Crain & Company podcast, thinks Utah poses a threat in the Big 12 and has the capability to compete for the national championship.\n\n\"Utah, to me, is dangerous,\" Crain said. \"Like sneak up, make the final four, get to the National Championship Game, dangerous.\"\n\nCrain mentioned Utah's recent success, winning two of the last three Pac-12 championships. The Utes also return quarterback Cam Rising, who led them to the two Pac-12 championships before missing last season due to an injury.\n\nHe also respects Kansas State heading into the 2024 season. However, Crain mentioned that he wants to see if the new quarterback, Avery Johnson, can throw the football well enough. Until that happens, he's picking the Utes in the Big 12 and sees them as a team that could surprise people and make it to the national championship.\n\nRelated: Greg McElroy Predicts Two Big 12 Superstars To Have Rebound Seasons In 2024", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jaron_spor@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jaron Spor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Utes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah Utes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_McElroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg McElroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avery Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas State Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/aa/6aa98f52-52bd-5aad-b9eb-345797c3d731/668c51b58f12a.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715786", "eventUri": "eng-9715786", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

We've got a terrific roster, a great quarterback, and all the pieces are in place.\"\n\nWhittingham is going into his 20th season with the Utes, having also coached them in the Western Athletic and Mountain West before they became Pac-12 members in 2011.\n\nUtah is getting a big boost for its Big 12 debut with the return of 6-foot-2 senior quarterback Cameron Rising after he missed last season with a knee injury.\n\n\"I'm excited to watch him play again,\" Whittingham said. \"I mean, he's a terrific leader, terrific player, really the alpha dog of our football team. He's got the respect of everybody on the team. He's got that it factor at quarterback where he makes everybody around him better. And when he's in at quarterback he just exudes confidence and players believe in him. They believe in him 100%.\"\n\nRising threw for 3,034 yards with 26 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 2022, when he led the Utes to a win over USC and Caleb Williams in the Pac-12 title game.\n\nWildcat On The Prowl\n\nAvery Johnson took over as the Kansas State quarterback when veteran Will Howard decided to transfer to Ohio State.\n\nJohnson may have been the Wildcats starter this season even if Howard had returned for a fifth season. Johnson's first start came in the Pop-Tarts Bowl after Howard entered the transfer portal, with the former top recruit throwing two touchdowns and running for 71 yards and another score in a win over North Carolina State.\n\nKansas State was picked second in the Big 12 preseason poll with Johnson going into his sophomore season.\n\n\"I feel like it played a big role, just being able to go out there and kind of knock the dust off and get that first start out of the way,\" Johnson said Tuesday. \"It was a lot of fun, just being able to go out there and play confidently with the guys around me. They really made my job easy.\"\n\nBelieving In Vegas\n\nBig 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark mentioned Las Vegas nine times during his opening address, emphasizing how important it was for the league to establish a long-standing relationship in what has become a sports hotbed. That could lead to an eventual association with the Las Vegas Bowl, which remains committed to the SEC, Big 10 and the previous members of the Pac-12 Conference for the next two years.\n\n\"I'm confident at the right time we will have a formal affiliation with the Las Vegas Bowl,\" Yormark said. \"This market is critically important. ... We need to be here in Vegas for all the right reasons. ... Entertainment and sports capital of the world, so critically important market for us in the future.\"\n\nLas Vegas Bowl Executive Director John Saccenti, who was in attendance, said with the Big 12 now well-represented across the country, it makes sense to eventually be aligned with the league.\n\n\"With these conferences expanding to more teams and with them all having national footprints, I want us to be in a good position to have some flexibility with as many folks as possible to continue to put the best matchup that's good for the destination,\" Saccenti said.\n\nSideline Surfaces\n\nThe Big 12 and Microsoft announced Tuesday that the technological giant will provide Surface devices to each football program this fall to use on the sideline and in the coaching booth.\n\nThe tablets will enable players and coaches to access immediate footage for review of in-game action. They are the same devices used by all 32 NFL teams.\n\nThe NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved the use of tablets to view in-game videos earlier this year. Teams can have up to 18 active tablets for use in the coaching booth, sideline, and locker room.

Everything he says or does feels like it needs to be captured and potentially shared as big news.\n\nThe only difference is, he's a famous coach instead of a famous fan.\n\n\"We're lucky in our league that he's with us, because he brings more people and notoriety and viewers to the Big 12 conference,\" Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. \"That's what makes it go. We need viewership. We want people to watch our teams play. It will be fun to have him in our league.\"\n\nMany have debated which football programs are in the best position to replace Oklahoma and Texas as new kingpins of the Big 12.\n\nIn terms of winning the conference on a regular basis, a good argument could be made for a number of teams. Kansas State has already claimed a Big 12 championship under Chris Klieman. Oklahoma State has staying power with Gundy. Utah won a bunch in the Pac-12.\n\nAnd no one will be shocked if Iowa State, Kansas or TCU makes it to AT&T Stadium this season.\n\nBut there is one problem with that debate. A Big 12 championship doesn't guarantee national attention or prestige for any team.\n\nSure, Oklahoma won a lot of trophies in the Big 12. But what made Texas unique is that the Longhorns were viewed as a national power even as they slumped through a 13-year championship drought between the Mack Brown and Steve Sarkisian eras.\n\nGood or bad, casual fans wanted to watch the Longhorns play just as much as they wanted to see Michigan, Ohio State, Alabama and Georgia.\n\nWho can fill that void in the Big 12? Colorado seems like the strongest candidate with Sanders at the helm. It also doesn't hurt that his son, Shedeur, is one of the biggest stars in the game.\n\nLast season, the Buffaloes generated massive TV ratings even though they won just four games.\n\nThen came the offseason, where Colorado mercilessly bid farewell to many of its under-performing players and brought in an army of transfers. That led to plenty of additional headlines.\n\nIn fact, Colorado has received so much attention that Sanders feels like his team gets judged differently than most of its peers.\n\n\"I'm judged on a different scale,\" Sanders said. \"My wins are totally different than your wins. You don't just judge it on football ... We have to win in every area.\n\n\"That's the way we're judged, and I'm cool with that. Because we are a little different and the expectation is greater. But it's been like that all my life. I've always had a greater expectation for myself.\"\n\nThe Buffaloes might get even more exposure now that they have left the Pac-12 and joined the Big 12.\n\nConference commissioner Brett Yormark is hoping for that. No other coach or team in the league can currently draw a crowd like Colorado.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The reason for the detour was Big 12 Media Days at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, which started Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the first formal event in the new conference for the Sun Devils and three other former Pac-12 foes in Arizona, Utah and Colorado. The addition of those teams gives the Big 12 teams in 10 states stretching from one coast to another. Eight teams took turns on the main stage, then rotating to other media stops and promotional shoots around the floor of the stadium, which serves as home to the NFL's Raiders.\n\nThe conference issued 500 media credentials for the annual event, which began with an address and question and answer segment with commissioner Brett Yormark.\n\n\"I've been saying it for a year now, but the four corner (schools) was the 'A' scenario for us when we thought about realignment. Big brands, great markets, engaged fan bases, both academic and athletic excellence,\" he said. \"We got deeper and better in football. We got deeper and better in basketball and we got deeper and better in Olympic sports. So it's been a win for this conference and I'm thrilled and excited to officially welcome the four corners. As I said, they're here today, obviously. And I think we're in for something pretty special as a conference.\"\n\nWith the Big 12 swelling to 16 teams, it was necessary to stretch the event over two days. ASU's biggest rival, Arizona, is among the teams to be featured Wednesday.\n\nThe Pac-12, which held its 2023 media day in Las Vegas, featured each coach and two players from each team. But the Big 12 likes to go big as evidenced by the recent conference expansion. Four players accompanied each coach. A few even brought five.\n\nDillingham, appropriately dressed in a maroon suit, brought with him center Leif Fautanu, running back Cameron Skattebo, safety Xavion Alford and edge rusher Clayton Smith.\n\nBoth Alford and Smith hail from Texas and are excited about joining a conference that will take them closer to home on a regular basis.\n\nThe Sun Devils are looking to bounce back from a second straight 3-9 showing so the chance to play in a new conference could be something good.\n\n\"It's an honor to be selected by my coach to be here,\" Alford said. \"I'm excited about playing in the Big 12. Being from Texas I've already come across a bunch of players I know or have played against. There are going to be some great games. I know it's still new to a lot of people but it's like a fresh start so that's probably good for us.\"\n\nASU athletic director Graham Rossini was among his school representatives. He too was donning the school colors. Rossini, like Dillingham a graduate of the school with a vested interest in turning around the narrative surrounding the program, was formally appointed earlier this summer but has been working behind the scenes for several months.\n\n\"It's oddly familiar,\" he said of being in Las Vegas. \"We were on this field not that long ago, done a lot in Las Vegas over the years. It's a great place, easy access for our fans. So it is nice to see the familiar brands in U of A, Colorado and Utah alongside us in a setting we know well but then you recognize that this is different. We're all preparing for life in the Big 12. It's really exciting. We know that is in front of us and we want to make the most of this, how do we join this conference, how do we get a chance to be part of this national footprint and how easy it will be for our fans to watch us compete. It feels closer to getting real.\"\n\nASU starts the season Aug. 31, against Wyoming. Its first Big 12 game will come on Sept. 21, against Texas Tech in Lubbock.\n\n\"I'm excited about playing in all these unbelievable cities. Unbelievable atmospheres for our guys to play in,\" Dillingham said. \"I think tis is one of the best coached conferences in the country, top to bottom. I'm excited to be part of it.\"\n\nAmong the other player appearing was running back Ollie Gordon II of Oklahoma State, a first team preseason pick and an athlete singled out by many as a potential conference player of the year. Gordon kept with the scheduled appearance despite an arrest on charges of suspicion of driving under the influence on June 30. He has publicly apologized and took responsibility for the incident.\n\nCoach Mike Gundy said the staff talked about whether or not the player should attend and decided to let him do so and answer questions as he saw fit. Once the event was over it would mark the end of discussion on that topic.\n\nGordon was named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year as a sophomore last season, tallying 1,732 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns on 285 carries.\n\nASU will play Oklahoma State on the road on Nov. 2.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

ESPN's Pete Thamel appeared on College Football Live on Tuesday and revealed some out of conference games that could help improve the way the league is viewed.\n\n\"Talking to coaches here today and Big 12 officials, at the Raiders stadium they channeled Al Davis -- just win, baby,\" Pete Thamel said. \"They need to win marquee non-league games. West Virginia needs to beat Penn State in the opening weekend. Colorado needs to go make a great showing at Nebraska in September.\"\n\nGetting those two wins would be huge for the league, although there is one out-of-conference game that could hurt the league no matter the result.\n\nKansas State and Arizona face off in Week 3 in a non-conference game that has been scheduled for some time. The two Wildcats are both being mentioned as contenders in the Big 12 as the season gets underway.\n\n\"One thing to watch, and one thing officials told me they had some hesitation about, is Kansas State hosts Arizona in Week 3 in a non-league game. It had been scheduled years in advance when they were in different leagues,\" Thamel said. \"You have to wonder if that, with those teams being contenders for the College Football Playoff, if that non-league matchup given one of their contenders an extra loss, comes back to bite the Big 12 at the end of the year.\"\n\nSpeaking of the College Football Playoff, Utah coach Kyle Whittingham believes the Big 12 will be judged more by what happens in the postseason than during the regular season.\n\n\"Well, I think when you get to the playoff, win,\" Whittingham said of how to help the league's reputation. \"You can't just get there, you want to get there and show up and be very competitive. I think that really will be the key is how we fare when we do get to the playoff -- what can we accomplish.\"\n\nBig 12 Media Days got underway on Tuesday and will continue with Day 2 on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_connolly@on3.com", "name": "Matt Connolly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Thamel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Thamel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas State Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucson, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tucson, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas State Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penn State Nittany Lions football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Whittingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Whittingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/06214441/big-12-football.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715786", "eventUri": "eng-9715786", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

We've got a terrific roster, a great quarterback, and all the pieces are in place.\"\n\nWhittingham is going into his 20th season with the Utes, having also coached them in the Western Athletic and Mountain West before they became Pac-12 members in 2011.\n\nUtah is getting a big boost for its Big 12 debut with the return of 6-foot-2 senior quarterback Cameron Rising after he missed last season with a knee injury.\n\n\"I'm excited to watch him play again,\" Whittingham said. \"I mean, he's a terrific leader, terrific player, really the alpha dog of our football team.

They really made my job easy.\"\n\nBelieving In Vegas\n\nBig 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark mentioned Las Vegas nine times during his opening address, emphasizing how important it was for the league to establish a long-standing relationship in what has become a sports hotbed. That could lead to an eventual association with the Las Vegas Bowl, which remains committed to the SEC, Big 10 and the previous members of the Pac-12 Conference for the next two years.\n\n\"I'm confident at the right time we will have a formal affiliation with the Las Vegas Bowl,\" Yormark said. \"This market is critically important. ... We need to be here in Vegas for all the right reasons. ... Entertainment and sports capital of the world, so critically important market for us in the future.\"\n\nLas Vegas Bowl Executive Director John Saccenti, who was in attendance, said with the Big 12 now well-represented across the country, it makes sense to eventually be aligned with the league.\n\n\"With these conferences expanding to more teams and with them all having national footprints, I want us to be in a good position to have some flexibility with as many folks as possible to continue to put the best matchup that's good for the destination,\" Saccenti said.\n\nSideline Surfaces\n\nThe Big 12 and Microsoft announced Tuesday that the technological giant will provide Surface devices to each football program this fall to use on the sideline and in the coaching booth.\n\nThe tablets will enable players and coaches to access immediate footage for review of in-game action. They are the same devices used by all 32 NFL teams.\n\nThe NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved the use of tablets to view in-game videos earlier this year. Teams can have up to 18 active tablets for use in the coaching booth, sideline, and locker room. But the tablets can't be connected to other devices to project larger additional images and cannot include analytics, data or data access capability or other communication access.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Utes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah Utes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avery Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Whittingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Whittingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Rising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Rising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas State Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop-Tarts Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:NDQ3YWE2OTEtYzMyZi00:YWU2MzYz/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715786", "eventUri": "eng-9715786", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Given the Big 12 now houses 16 teams, eighth and ninth are middle of the pack. And the Red Raiders can take heart from the consensus view expressed on Tuesday's day one of Big 12 media days.\n\nCommissioner Brett Yormark told writers and broadcasters assembled at Allegiant Stadium the Big 12 \"will be the deepest conference in America.\" Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy, whose team landed third in both the Big 12 and USA TODAY Sports Network preseason polls, touted the parity.\n\nAnd Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, whose team is the favorite in both, sees a wide-open race.\n\n\"We got picked number one,\" Whittingham said, \"but in my estimation eight or nine teams could win this thing, so we'll just have to see how things unfold.\"\n\nRelated: 5 things to know about Texas Tech football ahead of Big 12 media days\n\nMore: How Patrick Mahomes II, Joey McGuire worked with adidas to bring Texas Tech football a new look\n\nNow that Texas and Oklahoma are gone to the Southeastern Conference, the Big 12 includes a sizable pool of football programs with comparable talent, resources and periods of success. That being the case, Yormark says \"every week will matter\" and \"November will be incredibly exciting.\"\n\nFour Big 12 holdovers, plus newcomers Arizona and Utah, won eight to 10 games last season. For Texas Tech to crack that upper crust, Red Raiders coach Joey McGuire says his team must play better on the road. Tech plays five of its first seven games at home, and McGuire's teams are 8-2 in November and December in his first two years.\n\nHowever, the Red Raiders were 3-8 in road games the past two years.\n\n\"We have not been tough enough to win games on the road,\" McGuire said. \"That's been one of our biggest Achilles heels, consistently being able to win on the road. It's tough to do that in this conference, but if we're going to be in the mix, if we're going to be talked about at the end of the year playing in the Big 12 championship game ... we've got to find ways to win games on the road.\"\n\nMcGuire and four staff members made a late-May trip to Detroit to consult Lions coach Dan Campbell, whose team was 6-3 on the road last year.\n\nTech's road games this year are at Washington State, Arizona, TCU, Iowa State and Oklahoma State.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Can Texas Tech football win new Big 12?

Instead of the typical grand stages and lengthy pressers, the Pac-12 will be hosting a casual cocktail party Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. PT for reporters interested in the conference's next steps.\n\nIt's the latest unconventional move for the Pac-12, following a set of patchwork deals to piece together a viable sports schedule over the next two years. Oregon State and Washington State have a football scheduling alliance with the Mountain West Conference, and a media-rights deal with The CW and Fox Sports. Most other sports will compete temporarily as affiliate members of the West Coast Conference.\n\nThe \"zombie Pac-12\" will live on in another way over the next two years, too. The 10 schools leaving the conference will still play in Pac-12 affiliated bowl games until those contracts expire after the 2025 college football season, according to The Action Network.\n\nIn 2026, there is expected to be a major reshuffling of bowl game affiliations in the aftermath of widespread conference realignment. On Tuesday, Yormark said he was confident that one game the Big 12 would end up being associated with is the Las Vegas Bowl, which in recent years has seen a Pac-12 school play one from the Big Ten or SEC. \"We need to be here in Vegas,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_rumsey@frontofficesports.com", "name": "David Rumsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State Beavers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Strip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI_21064941_168404034_lowres.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715786", "eventUri": "eng-9715786", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Athletic director Frank Broyles had canvassed Sutton and football coach Lou Holtz about their conference preferences, and both were in favor of at least inquiring about moving to the Big Eight.\n\n\"I don't think the Big Eight would invite us to join that league unless ... well, I can't see the Big Eight becoming the Big Nine,\" Sutton told The Oklahoman that day. \"But if Kansas State should find, in two or three years, that football-wise they're not going to be able to cut it, then there would be an opening and an invitation.\n\n\"If the decision ever was made by the Big Eight to invite us, I think there would be some real soul-searching by our administration and by Frank.\"\n\nNothing happened, and the topic fizzled. Then in 1987, the discussion of Arkansas' conference affiliation was reignited. Since 1965, Arkansas had been the only Southwest team to qualify for a major bowl outside of the league-affiliated Cotton Bowl, and it did so five times: three Sugar Bowls, two Orange Bowls. Arkansas and Rice were the only two Southwest Conference schools not under NCAA sanctions. The football program's trips to private schools in Texas netted Arkansas much less money than what the Razorbacks shared from their home gate. Arkansas even lost money on a flight to Rice in Houston.\n\nThe Razorbacks inquired about the Big Eight again, but Big Eight commissioner Carl James said his league didn't want new members after rebuffing North Texas State and Northern Illinois.\n\n\"If such a thing should happen, it would come as a blockbuster overnight,\" Broyles told the Arkansas Gazette in 1987. Again, the buzz led to nothing.\n\nThen on Aug. 1, 1990, Broyles and Arkansas accepted an invitation to join the Southeastern Conference. South Carolina followed nearly two months later. In 1996, the Big Eight merged with four Southwest Conference schools to become the Big 12. Beginning this month, half of the Big 12's original members will have left for other conferences (one, Colorado, is back in the fold this year), with four having moved to the SEC.\n\nCounting Arkansas and Penn State (which joined the Big Ten in June 1990), there have been 67 realignment moves among major-conference football programs over the last 34 years. This summer caps the most chaotic sequence of affiliation shifts in college football history. USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon join the Big Ten. Oklahoma and Texas shift to the SEC. Utah, Arizona and Arizona State move to the Big 12 along with Colorado.\n\nBut what if the Big Eight had invited Arkansas in 1987 and became the Big Nine in 1990? How would that move have impacted the SEC's first round of expansion? What about the corresponding membership changes for the ACC, Big East, Big Ten and Pac-10?\n\nWith the delicate nature of realignment dominoes in mind, let's explore an alternative timeline, starting with Arkansas leaving the Southwest Conference for the Big Eight.\n\nIn the 24-year stretch beginning with its unbeaten 1964 campaign and ending with 1987, Arkansas had 15 seasons of at least nine wins. The Big Eight's six teams not named Nebraska or Oklahoma reached double-digit victories a total of only three times over that span.\n\nOne of those six, Kansas State, was the worst program in major college football. The Wildcats went 33-131-4 from 1964 to 1987 and had 15 seasons with one win or fewer in Big Eight action. By '87 the program's average home attendance had exceeded 30,000 only once that decade. Kansas State started moving its home games against Oklahoma to Norman to generate more revenue for both programs. Despite nudges from fellow Big Eight schools that it should consider a step downward, Kansas State declined to leave the league voluntarily.\n\nIn an alternative timeline, Big Eight officials remain uneasy about an uneven nine-team conference, but Arkansas' football and men's basketball pedigree mean revenue. Plus, the move spurs the schools to once and for all hold a referendum on Kansas State.\n\nAfter nearly two years of discussion, Big Eight officials schedule a vote on Kansas State's status. Despite impassioned pleas for the Wildcats to step aside on their own, K-State's brass declines to leave. Ultimately, the membership declines to evict Kansas State, and the Big Eight becomes the Big Nine beginning in 1990.\n\nThe geography -- Arkansas was located closer to four Big Eight schools than its closest SWC foe -- makes the move reasonable. The new all-Texas SWC becomes vulnerable. Thanks to the 1984 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that removed NCAA control over conferences' pursuit of television money, other leagues approach Texas and Texas A&M. Those negotiations begin in earnest in 1990.\n\nSEC commissioner Roy Kramer is considered a visionary. He found a loophole in the NCAA rulebook that led to the SEC's addition of Arkansas and South Carolina and started the sport's top conference championship game. Kramer's legacy is just as secure in an alternative timeline, though the teams involved in his conference's first big move have changed.\n\nOf the SWC's eight remaining schools, Texas and Texas A&M are the most valuable properties. After an 11-1 finish in 1983, the Longhorns languished for the rest of the decade, playing to a 36-32-1 overall mark with three losing seasons. Jackie Sherrill revived Texas A&M with three consecutive Cotton Bowl appearances in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe SEC is more enticing to Texas A&M than to Texas, but the duo believe they're better together than separately. At the same time, Kramer sends feelers to independent schools Miami, Florida State, South Carolina and Virginia Tech. The collection of eastern independent schools begins talking about banding together, as the Big Ten and ACC court them individually. Along with the Texas schools, Colorado intrigues the Pac-12.\n\nPenn State becomes the first independent school to jump, accepting the Big Ten's invitation in 1990 (as was the case in reality). After numerous discussions with the SEC and Pac-10, Texas and Texas A&M opt for the Big Nine. The Pac-10 recalibrates but ultimately chooses to not pursue Colorado.\n\nMiami and Florida State are atop Kramer's wish list, but South Carolina and Virginia Tech remain in play, too.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the Big East and ACC were two of the nation's top three men's basketball conferences. Each had a recognizable regional identity and didn't want to dilute its product. But they both knew they had to improve in football or get picked apart by other entities.\n\nIn our alternative timeline, the ACC, Big East, Florida State and Miami pull off a stunning series of moves in early 1991. The ACC invites Florida State while Miami joins the Big East. The four Big East football members (Miami, Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Boston College) plus West Virginia merge with the nine ACC schools (counting Florida State) to create a football-only conference. The leagues would keep separate identities for every other sport but become a solo scheduling entity for football called the Atlantic East.\n\nPlans for an ACC-Big East 16-team football super-structure are scuttled when Kramer adds South Carolina and Virginia Tech to make the SEC a 12-member conference. Both schools are located in new markets contiguous with SEC states. Kramer then announces his football league would split into East and West divisions and stage a conference championship game. Virginia Tech is placed in the West Division with Alabama, Auburn, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and LSU to ensure major rivalries stay intact but is awarded Kentucky as a crossover opponent. The East Division includes Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Kentucky and South Carolina.\n\nStunned by the SEC's move, the Atlantic East quickly adapts into a two-division structure. Instead of basing its alignment on geography, the Atlantic East opts for a zipper approach: Major rivals are placed in opposite divisions as permanent crossover rivalries, then other important series are stitched together. The American Division consists of Miami, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Georgia Tech, North Carolina, Duke and Virginia. The National Division comprises Florida State, West Virginia, Boston College, Clemson, NC State, Wake Forest and Maryland.\n\nAs the Big 11 watches the SEC and Atlantic East launch lucrative championship games for the 1992 season, it decides it needs a new member. The six remaining Southwest Conference teams trip over themselves angling for an invitation. The league dabbles a bit with LSU but doesn't get anywhere and considers BYU and Utah. Ultimately, it comes down to a pair of Texas schools: Baylor and Texas Tech.\n\nTexas Gov. Ann Richards leans on Texas and Texas A&M officials to pick her alma mater, Baylor, while the league's other members prefer a public school. In a close vote with Texas and Texas A&M abstaining, the nine other schools ratify Texas Tech as the Big 12's 12th member, beginning play in 1994.\n\nThe league's divisional discussion comes down to a pair of ideas. The first explores a North-South split. The second is a geographical hybrid in which the six central schools -- Nebraska, Kansas, Kansas State, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Arkansas -- form a Heartland Division and the other six become the Trails Division. Debate rages over several weeks with Nebraska and Texas on opposite sides. Finally, Arkansas brokers a compromise. The league headquarters would remain in Kansas City, Mo.; the divisional alignment follows the North-South split. The Nebraska-Oklahoma series earns permanent protection for a six-year block with future renewals but moves off Thanksgiving weekend. The measure passes unanimously.\n\nThe five remaining Southwest Conference schools choose to reform rather than disband the league. They consider looking to the Western Athletic Conference but instead opt for an eastern wing with independents. Baylor, TCU, SMU, Houston and Rice invite Tulsa, Tulane, Southern Miss, Louisville, Memphis, Cincinnati and East Carolina to form a new 12-member league.\n\nThroughout the changes on this alternative timeline, one school sits and watches every scenario play out. In reality, Notre Dame accepted a Big East invitation in 1994 to join in all sports but football. In this timeline, the Irish do the same thing.\n\nIn 1998, both the Atlantic East and the Big Ten approach Notre Dame about becoming a full member. The Irish's Big East connection forces university brass to weigh those options. The Atlantic East overtures are dismissed quickly. The Big Ten, however, is different. Its athletic and academic profile coupled with its geography leads Notre Dame officials to investigate the school's best interests.\n\nThe real-life negotiations between the Big Ten and Notre Dame during this time period would have forced the Irish to wait six years after joining the league to become a financially vested member. In an alternative world, the Big Ten allows Notre Dame to receive the same amount from media rights deals as other members on its first day. Notre Dame's home games remain televised on NBC until its contract expires, while ABC/ESPN secures the remaining Big Ten inventory. The Big Ten also helps Notre Dame build an academic profile capable of achieving AAU status.\n\nThe debate intensifies in South Bend. Notre Dame's Board of Trustees met Feb. 5, 1999 in London to either approve membership or extend independence permanently. Trustees could not reach consensus and tabled the discussion for six weeks before setting a vote for early June 1999. Unlike in real life, when the Board of Trustees voted 39-0 to remain independent, in this timeline the board votes 30-9 to apply for the Big Ten. Notre Dame had first applied for the Big Ten one hundred years earlier but did not show up at the Dec. 1, 1899 membership meeting in Chicago, which saw Indiana and Iowa become the first expansion schools in collegiate athletics history.\n\nNotre Dame agrees to start Big Ten play in 2002. Debate swirls over whether geography or competitive equality should dictate the league's divisional structure. Ultimately, the Big Ten chooses a hybrid, with Penn State linking up with Notre Dame and the farther western schools. Penn State, Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and Northwestern form the Stripes Division. The Stars Division includes Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Indiana, Purdue and Illinois. This round of realignment conjecture concludes with an actual matchup between Big Ten unbeatens Ohio State and Iowa battling at Soldier Field in the league's first conference championship game.",

So get yourself a high-powered GPS instead.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference will officially \"welcome\" -- although that might not be the proper term -- Oklahoma and Texas into its insane asylum next week at SEC Media Days in, of all places, Dallas.\n\nSomehow that just doesn't sound right, but is pretty typical of a national malaise.\n\nThe whole college football landscape has gone all topsy-turvy, upside down, somewhat crossways and, from sea to shining sea, decidedly geographically challenged and as numerically ignorant as ever.\n\nSo if our young, wide-eyed transfer, for instance, thought he was going to \"take my talents\" to the Pac-12, he's in for a rude awakening.\n\nAs far as we know, Southern Cal and UCLA are still in Los Angeles, but the Pac-12 no longer exists.\n\nThe self-styled \"Conference of Champions\" officially vaporized on July 1, but it had been reduced to crumbs and morsels (Oregon State and Washington State) ever since college baseball season ended.\n\nThose Beavers and Cougars, the losers in the offseason musical chairs, are the orphans in this madcap realignment.\n\nThey have been reduced to settling for something called a \"scheduling agreement\" with the Mountain West Conference, while their other sports have some equally vague handshake with the West Coast Conference.\n\nWashington and Oregon followed the two California schools to the Big Ten, which now has 18 teams and is probably still accepting applications.\n\nThe rest of the old Pac-12 also tossed logic to the ditch before scattering to and fro.\n\nStanford and Cal Berkley, both a stone's throw from the Pacific Ocean, are now in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The ACC also welcomed Southern Methodist from the American Athletic Conference.\n\nThat brings the ACC up to 17 teams, although that number doesn't include Notre Dame, which has one of those scheduling agreements with the league, but the Irish only play for the conference championship during pandemic seasons.\n\nThe real speculation at the ACC's media days in Charlotte, North Carolina, however, was wondering, how is the league faring with its two malcontents?\n\nWhile the three ACC newcomers are excited to get in, two mainstays are suing the league to get out. That'd be Florida State and Clemson, who are upset that, as it stands, it would cost a large fortune in exit fees, maybe north of $500 million, to leave the ACC before 2036.\n\nMeanwhile, the Big 12, traditionally based in Texas and the Midwest, is having its Media Days in -- where else? -- Las Vegas, which I think is still somewheres in Nevada.\n\nTypical of the oddities of mass realignment, the odds-on preseason favorite this year will be Utah -- which wasn't even in the Big 12 last year.\n\nThe Utes were one of four Pac-12 exiles to find safe harbor, along with Arizona, Arizona State and Colorado.\n\nSo if you're keeping score at home, the Big 12 subtracted two (Texas and OU) and added four and ended up with 16.\n\nBut what happens in Vegas just might stay in Vegas -- namely, the numerically insignificant Big 12 name.\n\nThe media festivities did, in fact, open amid rumors that the conference is considering selling its naming rights to the highest bidder -- and we're not talking about naming rights to, say, the conference title game or media days, but the name of the conference itself, the whole shebang.\n\nYes, the Big 12 Conference could become, for lack of a better example, the Poulan Weedeater Conference presented by Bad Boy Mowers.", "source": {"uri": "americanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lake Charles American Press"}, "authors": [{"uri":

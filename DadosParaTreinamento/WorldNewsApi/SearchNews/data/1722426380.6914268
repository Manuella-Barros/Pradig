Fine jewelry designs conceived in their studio were intended to enhance a busy woman\u2019s everyday uniform. Strikingly simple, streamlined, and versatile, pieces from the brand consistently echo a subdued brand of elegance and sophistication that would endure time, season, and trend. Both founders share, \u201cWe see the LI\u00c9 STUDIO collection as an extension of our own personal style\u2014timeless and classic with a modern twist. With a fast-paced lifestyle in mind, we strive to make quality, everyday essentials that elevate the wardrobe. Ultimately, we want to make it effortless for the LI\u00c9 woman to look and feel confident no matter the occasion and wherever their day takes them.\u201d The facade of Lie\u0301 Studio's 40 square meter flagship store in Copenhagen Hampus Berndtson The Emma Bracelet and Necklace are modern staples for the modern woman.

The brand steadily gained traction among the fashionable set and within tight circles of It girls. Amalie and Cecilie remember, \u201cHaving worked in the industry from such a young age, we had each built a strong global community on social media. Luckily from the beginning, we were able to expose the brand to a very global audience.\u201d Minimalist forms informed by Scandinavian aesthetics immediately appealed to the modern sensibilities of the their global audience, especially in the US. The duo adds, \u201cOur channels on Instagram and Pinterest have been instrumental in introducing our brand to so many markets, and subsequently our amazing retail partners.\u201d The last six months have been especially pivotal for the brand. Just last April, Li\u00e9 Studio launched a capsule collection for Net-A-Porter. The Danish label also recently introduced a line of leather accessories called The Staples. These milestones were shortly followed by the opening of its inaugural flagship at the Egmont Media House on Vognmagergade in Copenhagen.

The Moosgaard sisters introspect, \u201cWe think of LI\u00c9 STUDIO as a broader design philosophy outside of jewelry or leather (a new category we introduced this season). It can be challenging to express the universe of the brand only online and we wanted to open a physical retail space where we could welcome in our community and provide an experience that extended beyond the two dimensional.\u201d For everyone involved in building the flagship, the space is a representation of a curious mindset. \u201c Emma Bracelets by LIE\u0301 STUDIO LI\u00c9 STUDIO Sonya Earrings by LIE\u0301 STUDIO LI\u00c9 STUDIO The Norma Tote by LIE\u0301 STUDIO LI\u00c9 STUDIO They engaged Scandinavian designer Julius Neilson to turn vision into reality within a 40-square meter space. \u201cWe discovered Julius through his work at Goods, a men\u2019s wear store in Copenhagen, where his focus on simplicity and material choice aligned perfectly with our vision. His portfolio includes churches and private residence projects, showcasing expertise in multifunctional spaces that resonated with our desire to blend architectural elements with retail and personal style,\u201d Amalie and Cecilie recount. His mandate was to translate the brand\u2019s identity, exploring the intersection between personal style, architectural heritage, and modern retail.\u201d More than a retail destination the team was keen on creating a homey, welcoming atmosphere. Key pieces that merged the retail experience with the founders\u2019 personal style include a veneer centerpiece that would function as an large-scale jewelry box. According to the founders, this detail was an integral part of the design vision.

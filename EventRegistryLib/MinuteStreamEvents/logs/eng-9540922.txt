Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump appears at Manhattan criminal court before his trial in New York, Friday, May 3, 2024. (Charly Triballeau/Pool Photo via AP)\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape\u00b4s release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood\u00b4 tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star\u00b4s sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify - and Trump might never at all - but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I\u00b4m not going to Washington,\u00b4\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I\u00b4ve done for that (expletive) guy. I can\u00b4t believe I\u00b4m not going to Washington. I\u00b4ve saved that guy\u00b4s (expletive) so many times, you don\u00b4t even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury - all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine - $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court\u00b4s decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks to the media at Manhattan criminal court, Friday, May 3, 2024, in New York.

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Morning Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@mcall.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Magic Valley"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA POLITICAL HURRICANE ... AND AN ACTUAL ONE\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTRUMP THE EXTORTION TARGET?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\n'WHAT DO WE GOT TO PAY FOR THIS?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nTHE 'JERK'\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTO JAIL A PRESIDENT\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nHere's some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA political hurricane ... and an actual one\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about groping women without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nThe immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial Tags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nTrump also faced a second contempt hearing over whether he had again violated his gag order over four more prospective violations. Judge Juan M. Merchan has not yet ruled on that sanctions request. Trump was fined $9,000 last Tuesday over nine gag order violations.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: Terms to know in Trump trial\n\n-- What Trump's gag order means in his hush money case\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases.

And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nFormer White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks on Friday painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nTHE WITNESS HEARD, BUT NOT YET SEEN\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nTRUMP EXPECTED IN COURT AS TRIAL ENTERS 12TH DAY\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case.

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA POLITICAL HURRICANE ... AND AN ACTUAL ONE\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTRUMP THE EXTORTION TARGET?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\n'WHAT DO WE GOT TO PAY FOR THIS?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nTHE 'JERK'\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTO JAIL A PRESIDENT\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

Check back for more information.\n\nOriginal copy follows.\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money trial are moving deeper into his orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories. That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\n'WHAT DO WE GOT TO PAY FOR THIS?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nTHE 'JERK'\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTO JAIL A PRESIDENT\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview in which he criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan Merchan said. Trump's statements, the judge continued, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nBut he also expressed reservations about the idea of putting Trump in jail, calling it \"the last thing I want to do.\"\n\n\"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings,\" Merchan said.\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors moving deeper into Trump's orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories.\n\nThat effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial entered its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@register-herald.com", "name": "Michael R.

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nHere's some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA political hurricane ... and an actual one\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about groping women without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nThe immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview in which he criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan Merchan said. Trump's statements, the judge continued, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nBut he also expressed reservations about the idea of putting Trump in jail, calling it \"the last thing I want to do.\"\n\n\"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings,\" Merchan said.\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors moving deeper into Trump's orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories.\n\nThat effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial entered its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nREAD ALSO: Denial and uncertainty are looming over a Biden-Trump rematch", "source": {"uri": "wltribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Williams Lake Tribune"}, "authors": [],

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA POLITICAL HURRICANE ... AND AN ACTUAL ONE\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTRUMP THE EXTORTION TARGET?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\n'WHAT DO WE GOT TO PAY FOR THIS?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nTHE 'JERK'\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTO JAIL A PRESIDENT\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"", "source": {"uri": "capitolhillblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capitol Hill Blue"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Associated Press Archives)\n\nThe judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday for violating his gag order once again and sternly warned the former president that additional violations could result in jail time.\n\nThe fine marks the second time since the trial began last month that Trump has been sanctioned for violating the gag order, which bars him from making incendiary comments about jurors, witnesses and other people closely connected to the case. He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan said before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Trump's statements, the judge added, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview with television channel Real America's Voice in which Trump criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"That jury was picked so fast -- 95% Democrats,\" Trump said at the time. \"The area's mostly all Democrat. You think of it as a, just a purely Democrat area. It's a very unfair situation that I can tell you.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. When the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nYet even as Merchan warned of jail time in his most pointed and direct admonition, he also made clear his reservations about a step that he described as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail,\" Merchan said. \"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors calling to the stand Jeffrey McConney, the former Trump Organization controller.\n\nHe retired from the company last year after 36 years after being granted immunity to testify for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial, where he admitted breaking the law to help fellow executives avoid taxes on company-paid perks. The company was convicted and is appealing.\n\nThe testimony follows an inside-the-room account given to jurors Friday about Trump's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, was by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories.\n\nThat effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial entered its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday for violating his gag order once again and sternly warned the former president that additional violations could result in jail time.\n\nThe fine marks the second time since the trial began last month that Trump has been sanctioned for violating the gag order, which bars him from making incendiary comments about jurors, witnesses and other people closely connected to the case. He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan said before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Trump's statements, the judge added, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview with television channel Real America's Voice in which Trump criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"That jury was picked so fast -- 95% Democrats,\" Trump said at the time. \"The area's mostly all Democrat. You think of it as a, just a purely Democrat area. It's a very unfair situation that I can tell you.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. When the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nYet even as Merchan warned of jail time in his most pointed and direct admonition, he also made clear his reservations about a step that he described as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail,\" Merchan said. \"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors calling to the stand Jeffrey McConney, the former Trump Organization controller.\n\nHe retired from the company last year after 36 years after being granted immunity to testify for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial, where he admitted breaking the law to help fellow executives avoid taxes on company-paid perks. The company was convicted and is appealing.\n\nThe testimony follows an inside-the-room account given to jurors Friday about Trump's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, was by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories.\n\nThat effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial entered its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses.

And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nAnd Former White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the ''Access Hollywood'' tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nTHE WITNESS HEARD, BUT NOT YET SEEN\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nTRUMP EXPECTED IN COURT AS TRIAL ENTERS 12TH DAY\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case.

That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\nREAD MORE: Former Trump adviser Hope Hicks testifies in hush money trial\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nREAD MORE: Jurors in hush money trial hear recording of Trump discussing plan with Michael Cohen to pay off woman\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@pbs.org", "name": "Michael R.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday for violating his gag order once again and sternly warned the former president that additional violations could result in jail time.\n\nThe fine marks the second time since the trial began last month that Trump has been sanctioned for violating the gag order, which bars him from making incendiary comments about jurors, witnesses and other people closely connected to the case. He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan said before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Trump's statements, the judge added, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview with television channel Real America's Voice in which Trump criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"That jury was picked so fast -- 95% Democrats,\" Trump said at the time. \"The area's mostly all Democrat. You think of it as a, just a purely Democrat area. It's a very unfair situation that I can tell you.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. When the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nYet even as Merchan warned of jail time in his most pointed and direct admonition, he also made clear his reservations about a step that he described as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail,\" Merchan said. \"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors calling to the stand Jeffrey McConney, the former Trump Organization controller.\n\nHe retired from the company last year after 36 years after being granted immunity to testify for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial, where he admitted breaking the law to help fellow executives avoid taxes on company-paid perks. The company was convicted and is appealing.\n\nThe testimony follows an inside-the-room account given to jurors Friday about Trump's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, was by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories.\n\nThat effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial entered its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\nMore from this section\n\nStack Sports launches Stack Rewards to Save Youth Sports Families $100M Striking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@kulr8.com", "name": "Michael R.

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHope Hicks, a former Trump confidant who played a central role in his orbit for years, detailed a defining moment from the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post leaked a 2005 Access Hollywood recording in which Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks admitted to being worried, very worried, when a reporter asked him for comment before breaking the story.\n\nI had a good feeling of believing that this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle over the next few days, Hicks said. This was a damaging development.\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors say it helps explain the frenzied efforts by Trump and his allies in the final weeks of campaign to try to suppress any new damaging stories that might arise. .\n\nFILE - Hope Hicks, former White House communications director, arrives to meet with the House Intelligence Committee, at the Capitol in Washington, February 27, 2018. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nIn fact, following the release of the tapes, Hicks said he asked Michael Cohen, then Trump's lawyer and personal fixer, to track down a rumor about another potentially damaging recording. No such tape existed anyway, Hicks said, but he sort of looked it up for me.\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the Access Hollywood story was so intense, Hicks recalls, that it distracted from a perfect storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the upcoming story. It didn't last long.\n\nDid the Access Hollywood tape make the hurricane disappear from the news? \" asked prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but a piece of his defense emerged last week when one of his lawyers suggested that Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nLawyer Emil Bove suggested during a particularly tense cross-examination that his client had indeed been targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sex with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove cited a group of celebrities who he said had been forced over the years to pay huge sums to Davidson's clients to remove harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, from whom Bove, according to Davidson, had extorted money; Davidson disputed the word excerpt, but said he had been involved in valid settlements with Sheen.\n\nEmil Bove, attorney for former President Donald Trump, sits in the courtroom at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York, Friday, May 3, 2024. (Jeenah Moon/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nDavidson also acknowledges that he was investigated by the FBI, but never charged, for allegedly trying to extort Hogan to prevent the release of the professional wrestling stars' sex tape.\n\nIn 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was familiar with the concept of trashing celebrities such as Trump.\n\nAnd you've done everything you can to get as close to that line in these negotiations as possible without crossing it, right? \" asked Bov\u00e9.\n\nI did everything I could to make sure my activities were legal, Davidson responded.\n\nWhat do we have to pay for that?\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify and Trump may never do so, but their voices were heard in the courtroom in perhaps the most striking piece of evidence yet now.\n\nProsecutors played loudly a September 2016 recording Cohen made of himself informing the then-presidential candidate of a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was ready to reveal her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a revelation that Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\nWhat are we going to pay for this? One hour fifty? Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nFILE - Michael Cohen arrives at the New York Supreme Court on October 25, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, file)\n\nThey discuss whether payment should be made in cash or by check. Then the recording stops.\n\nAlthough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and had long been publicly known, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment intended to establish that the secret payment was made with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe seemed visibly irritated as the recording played. The jurors seemed fascinated.\n\nTHE JERK\n\nThe recording wasn't the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was usually in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when he was told he had to respond to an angry call from Cohen about a blog post linked to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said that Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as a jerk who had been very, very aggressive and had threatened to sue me.\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, I was met with a barrage of insults, innuendoes and allegations. This lasted quite a while.\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen a month after the 2016 election, during which the Trump lawyer seemed depressed and discouraged and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\nHe said something like: Jesus Christ. Can you (exhaustive) believe I'm not going to Washington, Davidson said in describing Cohen. After everything I did for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved these guys (expletive) so many times you don't even know it.\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations could help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly telling jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTO GET A PRESIDENT\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's comments outside of court. He repeatedly slandered witnesses and suggested jury bias, all despite a judge's order of silence intended to bar him from any verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was fined $9,000 ($1,000) for each of nine separate violations of the silence order identified by the judge. Prosecutors then sought an additional $4,000 fine for what they said were additional violations of the order.\n\nStill, it's unclear what Judge Juan M. Merchan can do about continued violations. Merchan raised the possibility of prison time, an unprecedented outcome for a former U.S. president. It would also risk inflaming Trump's base as he runs for president and further upend the race for the White House in 2024.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, center, speaks with defense attorney Emil Bove, left, before the start of the trial in Manhattan Criminal Court, Friday, May 3, 2024 in New York. (Mark Peterson/Pool photo via AP)\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs some leeway to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he is subject to scrutiny. continued media coverage.\n\nMerchan didn't seem convinced, but prison, at least for now, doesn't seem to be the outcome anyone wants.\n\nBecause each of these statements was made before the Court found the defendant in contempt for violating this order on nine occasions, and because we prefer to minimize the disruption of this proceeding, we are not yet seeking prison , said prosecutor Chris Conroy.\n\nBut, he added, last Tuesday's court decision will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source":

Charly Triballeau/Pool Photo via AP\n\nNEW YORK -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday for violating his gag order once again and sternly warned the former president that additional violations could result in jail time.\n\nThe fine marks the second time since the trial began last month that Trump has been sanctioned for violating the gag order, which bars him from making incendiary comments about jurors, witnesses and other people closely connected to the case. He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview in which he criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan Merchan said. Trump's statements, the judge continued, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nBut he also expressed reservations about the idea of putting Trump in jail, calling it \"the last thing I want to do.\"\n\n\"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings,\" Merchan said.\n\nAdvertisement Related Trump escalates attacks on prosecutors, says Democrats run 'a Gestapo administration'\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors moving deeper into Trump's orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories.\n\nRelated Former Trump advisor Hope Hicks testifies at hush money trial\n\nThat effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial entered its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments.

Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\n-- Hulk Hogan, hurricanes and a blockbuster recording: A week in the Trump hush money trial\n\nThe judge in Donald Trump's hush money case found on Monday that Donald Trump had violated his gag order with comments he gave to a program called \"Just the News No Noise\" on April 22, which is broadcast on Real America's Voice.\n\nOn the program, the former president criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats. \"The jury was picked so fast. 95 percent Democrats. The area's mostly all Democrat,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Juan M.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nOutside the jury's presence, Trump was fined for running afoul of a judge's gag order. Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA POLITICAL HURRICANE ... AND AN ACTUAL ONE\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTRUMP THE EXTORTION TARGET?\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n'WHAT DO WE GOT TO PAY FOR THIS?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTHE 'JERK'\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTO JAIL A PRESIDENT\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sisak, Jennifer Peltz, Eric Tucker and Jake Offenhartz, Associated Press\n\nMonday, May 6, 2024 | 6:48 a.m.\n\nNEW YORK -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him $1,000 for violating his gag order and sternly warned the former president that additional violation could result in jail time.\n\nThe fine marks the second sanction for Trump for inflammatory comments about witnesses since the start of the trial last month. He was fined $9,000 last week for nine violations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time, though he said that was \"the last thing I want to do.\"\n\nProsecutors in Trump's hush money trial are moving deeper into his orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories. That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n____\n\nTucker reported from Washington.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "eric_tucker@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jennifer_peltz@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Jennifer Peltz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Michael R.

That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Merchan fined the former president $1,000 and warned that going forward, additional violations could result in jail time. Prosecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nWitness testimony was set to resume following Merchan's ruling, setting the stage for an even deeper dive into the events and people involved in what prosecutors have said was a scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories about the then-candidate.\n\nThe trial is in its 12th day.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Hope Hicks took the stand last week, recounting how Trump's campaign was turned upside-down following the leak of a video wherein he bragged about grabbing women without their permission.\n\nKeith Davidson, who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\n-- Hulk Hogan, hurricanes and a blockbuster recording: A week in the Trump hush money trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nThe judge in Donald Trump's hush money case found on Monday that Donald Trump had violated his gag order with comments he gave to a program called \"Just the News No Noise\" on April 22, which is broadcast on Real America's Voice.\n\nOn the program, the former president criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats. \"The jury was picked so fast. 95 percent Democrats. The area's mostly all Democrat,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Juan M. Merchan said the comments \"not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\n\nThe gag order bars Trump from making comments about the jurors, key witnesses and some others connected to the criminal trial.\n\nThe judge presiding over former President Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him an additional $1,000 for again violating a gag order barring him from making inflammatory comments about witnesses and jurors.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned on Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time.\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well,\" Merchan said. \"There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. Once the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nProsecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nThe judge had previously fined Trump $9,000 for nine earlier violations in posts on Truth Social and his website.\n\nBefore heading into the courtroom Monday morning, Donald Trump spoke to reporters, relaying familiar complaints about the fairness of the trial, the judge and the gag order that stops him commenting on witnesses and jurors.\n\nHe also noted the breaking news that Columbia University canceled its main commencement following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests.\n\n\"That shouldn't happen,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan as witness testimony in his hush money trial enters its third week.\n\nWitness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial is entering its third week on Monday and it remains to be seen who will take the stand next.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, jurors have heard from a host of different people.\n\nFollowing a weeklong jury selection process that began mid-April, jurors heard first from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who among other things explained his pledge to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nFormer White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks on Friday painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case. A second contempt hearing was held on Thursday over four more prospective violations, but Merchan did not immediately issue a decision.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news",

Prominent figures who could enter the courtroom in the coming days and weeks include porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump's former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, or former Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's former director of Oval Office operations, is another expected witness.\n\nProsecutors' plans for who they will call to the stand have been kept under wraps, but Daniels said in March during an appearance on The View that she was \"ready\" to testify and hopeful for the opportunity.\n\n\"I'm absolutely ready. I've been ready. I'm hoping with all of my heart that they call me because ... I don't need someone to speak for me,\" Daniels said.\n\nThe most glaring question surrounding witnesses is whether Trump will choose to take the stand to defend himself.\n\nWhile Trump repeatedly said he planned to testify, a decision by Judge Juan Merchan at the start of the trial to allow prosecutors to question Trump about several of his unrelated legal battles has created a dilemma for the former president. The decision means prosecutors can now interrogate Trump -- if he chooses to testify -- about his defamation case involving E. Jean Carroll or his civil fraud suit in an attempt to undermine Trump's credibility. Merchan has made clear that Trump has a Fifth Amendment right to decline to testify.\n\nCohen, for his part, went on a controversial media rampage in the lead-up to the trial and teased his forthcoming testimony while also aggressively criticizing Trump. Because of a gag order, Trump is restricted from responding publicly to Cohen's attacks.\n\nCohen's credibility has become a source of scrutiny in the hush money case.\n\nHe served as Trump's attorney and fixer in 2016. Two years later, he pleaded guilty to numerous federal crimes, including lying to a bank and Congress, as well as campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments for which Trump is now facing state charges.\n\nProsecutors have indicated that they expect Cohen to provide a firsthand account to jurors of how Trump was allegedly behind an illegal scheme to pay off Daniels. Cohen pleaded guilty for his role in the scheme in 2018, but federal prosecutors declined to charge Trump at the time.\n\nThose who have testified so far in the hush money case include former tabloid executive David Pecker, who spoke about his longtime \"catch-and-kill\" practice, which involved paying for the rights to stories, including two involving Trump, and then never publishing them in his magazines.\n\nKeith Davidson, a Los Angeles-based attorney who specializes in nondisclosure agreements, testified for several days about how he represented Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal as he negotiated payments for them in exchange for their silence about alleged affairs with Trump. Trump's attorneys have argued that hush-money payments are lawful.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nHope Hicks, who was intimately involved with the Trump campaign's day-to-day activities in 2016, took the stand for three hours on Friday and appeared nervous and at one point tearful, as she spoke about the campaign's scramble to course-correct Trump's image with women in the days ahead of the election.\n\nProsecutors have used witnesses like Hicks to help bolster their key allegation that Trump was motivated to make hush money payments to help his campaign. Trump's attorneys, however, secured cross-examination testimony from Hicks saying that Trump also had other motivations for wanting to keep the women quiet, including that he was worried about his wife Melania's opinion of him.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_oliver@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ashley Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Westerhout", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madeleine Westerhout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellyanne_Conway", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kellyanne Conway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

Check back for updates throughout the day.\n\nThe New York criminal hush money trial of Donald Trump will resume Monday after a dramatic week bookended by testimony from a former top White House aide and a warning from the judge that Trump's rhetoric could land him in jail.\n\nOn Friday, former longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks testified for the prosecution under subpoena. She provided an insider's account of how Trump and his team reacted to damaging news about him on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. This included the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump was caught on tape bragging about sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Everyone was just absorbing the shock of it,\" Hicks said, describing the immediate aftermath of the tape's release.\n\nThat tape renewed media interest in porn star Stormy Daniels' little known account of a sexual encounter she said she says she had with Trump in 2006. For much of the week, the jury heard from a lawyer who helped broker a $130,000 hush money payment for Daniels. That payment is at the center of the prosecution's case.\n\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a reimbursement to his lawyer for the payment to Daniels. The $130,000 was paid by Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen, less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg accuses Trump of concealing records of the payment to further an illegal scheme to influence the election.\n\nHicks testified that while she was working in the Trump White House, the president told her that Cohen had made the payment without Trump's knowledge in order to protect him, and that he did it \"out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\nHicks said she thought acting out of pure kindness would be \"out of character for Michael.\"\n\nShe also suggested that Trump was pleased the Daniels story did not come out before the election. \"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" she testified.\n\nWhen Trump's attorneys began their cross-examination, asking her basic questions about her time at the Trump Organization, Hicks quickly broke down in tears on the witness stand.\n\nEarlier in the week, Judge Juan Merchan held Trump in criminal contempt of court for nine violations of a gag order barring him from speaking about witnesses, jurors and other parties involved in the trial.\n\nMerchan gave Trump the maximum fine of $1,000 for each violation. The judge's order acknowledged that that fine is hardly enough to be a deterrent to a defendant as wealthy as Trump. But Merchan noted that Trump could face jail time if he continues to violate court orders.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_breuninger@cnbc.com", "name": "Kevin Breuninger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107401126-1713188708904-107401126-1713188631640-gettyimages-2147828793-AFP_34PF862.jpg?v=1713188716&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-04-", "textStart": 194, "textEnd": 202}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Some witnesses have been able to narrate the evidence to the jury, sharing what was going through their head at the time of the text message or email entered into evidence. Other evidence has been introduced by custodians -- witnesses called by prosecutors to authenticate records -- who were not direct participants in the events and are unable to provide the same kind of context for the evidence.\n\nTrump is on trial for allegedly falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. The former president has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have vowed that by the end of their case, the jurors will have a full picture of Trump's conduct and \"inescapably\" reach the conclusion that the former president is guilty.\n\n\"I am sure we can all agree that media accounts may be inaccurate or only tell parts of the story,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass advised potential jurors last month about their pre-existing knowledge of the case. \"After all, the media has not yet had access to the evidence that you are going to see in this case.\"\n\nHere are eight pieces of the evidence that jurors have already seen during the trial, contextualized by witness testimony and background events.\n\nProsecutors argued to the jury that the October 2016 release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape -- where Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals -- launched Trump's campaign into panic mode.\n\n\"I think there was consensus among us all that the tape was damaging, and this was a crisis,\" former campaign press secretary Hope Hicks testified.\n\nDuring Hicks' testimony, jurors saw the email from a Washington Post reporter requesting a comment about Trump's remarks before the newspaper broke the story.\n\nIn an email to then-campaign staffers Jason Miller, Kellyanne Conway, and Stephen Bannon, Hicks laid out an initial strategy.\n\n\"FLAGGING. 1) Need to hear the tape to be sure. 2) Deny, deny, deny,\" Hicks wrote in the email.\n\n\"Strategy number two was going to be a little more difficult,\" Hicks told jurors when asked about the email.\n\nTrump issued a video statement apologizing for his remarks, but the story dominated the news cycle for the following day.\n\n\"We were anticipating a Category 4 hurricane making landfall somewhere on the East Coast, and I don't think anybody remembers where or when that hurricane made landfall,\" Hicks said about the weekend when the news broke. \"It was all Trump, all the time, for the next 36 hours.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the news set into motion a series of events including Trump's effort to kill Stormy Daniels' allegations of an affair, denied by Trump, and his eventual criminal indictment for concealing information from voters.\n\nAs news broke about Trump's remarks on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, attorney Keith Davidson -- who represented both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal who also alleged an affair with Trump-- reacted to the development in a text message exchange with the former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard.\n\n\"Trump is f----,\" Davidson wrote.\n\n\"Wave the white flag. It's over people,\" Howard replied.\n\nDavidson testified last week that a business opportunity soon emerged from the reputational rubble of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, as Daniels' agent began shopping around the story of Trump's alleged affair with the adult film actress.\n\n\"It wasn't until 'Access Hollywood' that interest sort of reached a crescendo,' Davidson testified about Daniels' story.\n\nDavidson testified that over the coming weeks, he began negotiating a deal with Michael Cohen to buy the rights to the story, to guarantee Daniels' silence, for $130,000.\n\nAs Davidson and Cohen negotiated the rights for Daniels' story, the Trump campaign continued with its whirlwind schedule of rallies in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nJurors last week saw a clip of Trump's remarks at an Oct. 14, 2016, campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, where Trump appeared to recognize the impact of the allegations on his electoral odds.\n\n\"These are all horrible lies, all fabricated, and we can't let them change the most important election in our lifetimes,\" Trump said. \"If just 5% of the people think it's true and maybe 10% we don't, we don't win.\"\n\nProsecutors argued that Trump's remarks demonstrated his motivation to kill Daniels' story.\n\nJust days before the 2016 election, Cohen successfully negotiated the rights to buy Stormy Daniels' story for $130,000. Davidson testified that while Cohen made the payment using his own money, he believed Trump would ultimately fund -- and be the beneficiary of -- the payment.\n\nJurors saw the wire transfer authorization form from Cohen's shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, to Keith Davidson's trust account for Stormy Daniels.\n\nJurors also saw a signed confidential settlement agreement between David Dennison and Peggy Peterson, pseudonyms Davidson said he created for Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels.\n\nHope Hicks testified that Donald Trump told her in 2018 that he believed Cohen made the payment \"out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\n\"I would say that would be out of character for Michael,\" Hicks told jurors about Trump's assetion. \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person. He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nAfter winning the election, Donald Trump continued to keep an eye on the allegations of infidelity, according to the former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.\n\nPecker told jurors that he entered into an agreement with Trump and Cohen in the early days of the Trump campaign to serve as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" by looking out for negative stories about Trump related to women. Pecker testified that, as part of that agreement to help the Trump campaign, his company American Media Inc. had purchased the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story of an alleged affair, denied by Trump, for $150,000 in August 2016.\n\nIn the months following the election, Pecker said that Trump invited him to the White House for a \"thank you dinner.\" Jurors saw a July 2017 photo of Pecker and Trump walking together along the White House colonnade.\n\n\"At the time to have dinner, Mr. Trump asked me to join him in a walk from the Oval Office to the dining area. We passed the Rose Garden,\" Pecker told jurors. \"And as we walked out, President Trump asked me, 'How is Karen doing?'\"\n\n\"'So, I said, 'She's doing well. She's quiet. Everything is going good,'\" Pecker recounted to jurors.\n\nDespite Stormy Daniels staying quiet for more than a year after the 2016 election, the story of Cohen's hush money payment to the adult film actress broke in 2018.\n\nJurors saw the article from the Wall Street Journal about the payment, which was published under the headline, \"Trump Lawyer Arranged $130,000 Payment for Adult-Film Star's Silence.\"\n\nHope Hicks testified about Trump's reaction to the story.\n\n\"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story -- a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment,\" Hicks told jurors. \"And I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nWeeks after the Wall Street Journal broke the story of Cohen's hush-money payment, Daniels was scheduled to appear on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\n\n\"She wanted to talk about her life and reinvigorate her career,\" Davidson told jurors.\n\nJurors saw text messages from Cohen and Davidson, who attempted to coordinate a denial statement ahead of the late-night appearance.\n\n\"Michael Cohen had requested yet another statement from Stormy Daniels and on the day that she was appearing on Jimmy Kimmel, and he wanted to know whether or not she was going to release it,\" Davidson told jurors.\n\nJurors saw the statement that Davidson drafted for Daniels, which was put out hours before Daniels went on the show.\n\n\"I had a pretty clear idea of what I wanted to ask you tonight but then about like three hours ago I go on the internet and I see this letter that pops up,\" Kimmel asked Daniels on the show. \"Did you sign this letter that was released today?\"\n\n\"I don't know, did I?\" Daniels said. \"That does not look like my signature, does it?\"\n\nThough jurors have not seen the footage of the Kimmel appearance, they saw Cohen's immediate response.\n\n\"She just denied the letter,\" Cohen texted Davidson.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Merchan last week for nine alleged gag order violations concerning inflammatory comments about witnesses made in April.\n\n\"Defendant is hereby put on notice that if appropriate and warranted, future violations of its lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration,\" Merchan wrote.\n\n\"Prosecutors in Trump's hush money trial are moving deeper into his orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign,\" the New York Post reported. \"Hope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\"\n\n(Video Credit: NewsNation)\n\n\"Her testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories. That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics,\" the media outlet claimed.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks admitted concerning the \"Access Hollywood\" recording. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nHicks' testimony reportedly backfired on prosecutors as she became emotional and shredded their star witness Michael Cohen's dubious credibility. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer has previously pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. He has been caught in numerous lies.\n\nThis is the third week in Trump's trial. So far, the prosecution has presented precious little evidence of actual wrongdoing on the former president's part.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with alleged hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels -- prosecutors claim the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen for the payments, alleging that the transactions were falsely logged as legal expenses.\n\nThe former president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and has fervently denied alleged sexual relationships with the women accusing him.\n\n\"So far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal,\" the Post reported.\n\nTrump's attorneys have done a stellar job so far in the courtroom on his behalf. The outcome revolves around a potentially tainted jury. The lawyers are hammering the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses while deconstructing the case against the former president.\n\nThe prosecution has taken charges in the case against Trump that have long since passed the statute of limitations and is attempting to tie in the alleged payments with election tampering. Many consider it an outright abuse of the law, a stretch beyond belief not to mention an incredibly weak case.\n\nTrump is appealing the gag order, asserting that it violates his First Amendment rights. His attorneys claim the former president is not \"willfully\" violating the order.\n\n\"In arguing against the order Thursday, Trump's attorneys raised remarks made by President Biden at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner, in which the president jokingly lamented that Trump had recently faced 'stormy weather' -- a reference to Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress paid hush money at the center of the case,\" The Hill reported.\n\n\"Judge, last weekend, President Trump's rival, President Biden, said in a public forum -- he talked about this trial, and he talked about a witness that's going to be in this trial,\" Trump attorney Todd Blanche contended. \"He mocked President Trump.\"\n\nHe argued in front of Merchan that Trump is not being allowed to respond to Biden's attacks \"in the way that he would want to\" because of the gag imposed on his speech.\n\n\"He's running for president,\" Blanche pointed out. \"He has to be able to speak.\"\n\nMerchan responded that the gag order does not apply to Biden's remarks.\n\n\"He's certainly allowed to respond to something said by President Biden,\" the judge speciously informed the attorney.\n\n\"This gag order is totally unconstitutional,\" Trump stated previously. \"I'm the Republican candidate for president of the United States ... and I'm sitting in a courthouse all day long listening to this stuff.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nIndian students' deaths bring attention to mental health within the community\n\nSince the start of 2024, 10 Indian students have died across the country due to suicide, accidental overdose, or disappearing, with their bodies found days later.

That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump\u00b4s company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks to media as he returns to his trial at the Manhattan Criminal Court, Friday, May 3, 2024, in New York. (Charly Triballeau/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n____\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks to media as he returns to his trial at the Manhattan Criminal Court, Friday, May 3, 2024, in New York.

It is also the first of four separate criminal cases against him.\n\nAs the trial enters its fourth week, here are the highlights thus far.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan doesn't care if Trump speaks out against him in public, like he did to crowds in Waukesha, Wisconsin and Freeland, Michigan on Wednesday.\n\nMerchan has also given the defendant a pretty long leash with respect to airing grievances with the press and on the campaign trail about Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, President Joe Biden, and other political foes -- so long as the presumptive presidential nominee doesn't touch the topic of jurors, likely witnesses in his case, and staff and family members of the court and the DA's office.\n\nThe order also does not, despite Trump's protestation to the contrary, bar him from testifying in his own defense.\n\nThus far, prosecutors say Trump has breached the fairly narrow gag order fourteen times.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 30, the judge held Trump in contempt for repeatedly violating the gag order, warned that he could be put in jail if he again willfully violates court orders, fined Trump the maximum punishment of $1,000 for each of the nine violations, and ordered him to take down the posts from Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nProsecutor Chris Conroy called Trump's statements \"corrosive\" to the proceedings, but said the government was \"not yet seeking jail\" because prosecutors \"prefer to minimize disruptions.\"\n\nThe judge has not yet ruled on whether Trump violated the gag order another four times. Separately though, Merchan has, on a few occasions, admonished the former president for intimidating jurors with his conduct in the courtroom, including gesturing and side comments.\n\nThe prosecution's case hinges on convincing the jury that Trump tried to \"corrupt the 2016 election\" by making illegal payments -- transactions which he subsequently covered up by faking records, in yet another illegal act. The defense contends that Trump was not involved with any of this criminal record-keeping and that he only signed the checks.\n\nThe specific payment trail in question relates to money that Trump apparently sent to his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, to reimburse him for paying off porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, ahead of the election. At the time, Daniels wanted to go public with her story of having sex with Trump years earlier while he was married.\n\nTo make its case, the government began by calling to the stand the former CEO of National Enquirer publisher American Media.\n\nDavid Pecker was integral to the alleged \"catch and kill\" scheme, which was designed to shape the public narrative around Trump during the campaign by containing damaging information about him.\n\nPecker testified that his publication would \"embellish\" negative stories about Trump's political rivals during the 2016 election, in addition to publishing positive stories about Trump.\n\nPecker, who spoke on the stand about his unofficial role as being the \"eyes and ears\" of the campaign, named Cohen as central to this operation.\n\nAmerican Media paid $150,000 to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, another woman who wanted to share her story of an extramarital affair with Trump. Pecker, who said that he purchased the story in order to bury it, said that Trump never reimbursed the company.\n\nThe Daniels exchange was different, because the exchange of cash touched Cohen and Trump.\n\nThe prosecution called in Trump's longtime personal secretary Rhona Graff, who testified that Trump had the contact information for McDougal and Daniels saved to his phone. Banker Gary Farro described how he worked with Cohen to get $130,000 into a First Republic bank account -- money which was ultimately used to pay Daniels through her attorney in exchange for her silence.\n\nKeith Davidson, the former lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, took the stand to describe the negotiations that took place in 2016 for the rights to both of their stories.\n\nIn his testimony, Davidson described his dealings both with American Media and with Cohen. Calls recorded between Davidson and Cohen were also played for the jury.\n\nAnd then, on Friday, Hope Hicks took the stand to talk about the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape that threatened Trump's presidential run a few weeks before election Day. Trump is heard in the tape bragging about sexual misconduct toward women.\n\nThe former White House communications aide, whose testimony followed that of either other witnesses, said she was \"very concerned\" when the Washington Post reached out in October 2016 to seek comment.\n\n\"Everyone was just absorbing the shock of it,\" said Hicks, who later broke down in tears.\n\nShe added that the initial strategy was to \"deny, deny, deny.\"\n\nDavidson, who brokered the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, testified that the tape led to surge of interest in her story of an alleged extramarital affair with Trump.\n\n\"Before [the] 'Access Hollywood' tape, there was very little interest from what I understand,\" Davidson said in court.\n\nAs the trial enters week four, Trump is also waiting to see how the U.S. Supreme Court case on presidential immunity pans out.\n\nThe judge denied Trump's request to miss court for a day to hear oral arguments last month about whether the former president is immune from federal prosecution on criminal election interference charges.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [],

That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nMichael R.

Prominent figures who could enter the courtroom in the coming days and weeks include porn star Stormy Daniels, Trump's former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, or former Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's former director of Oval Office operations, is another expected witness.\n\nStormy ready\n\nProsecutors' plans for who they will call to the stand have been kept under wraps, but Daniels said in March during an appearance on The View that she was \"ready\" to testify and hopeful for the opportunity.\n\n\"I'm absolutely ready. I've been ready. I'm hoping with all of my heart that they call me because ... I don't need someone to speak for me,\" Daniels said.\n\nWill Trump take the stand?\n\nThe most glaring question surrounding witnesses is whether Trump will choose to take the stand to defend himself.\n\nWhile Trump repeatedly said he planned to testify, a decision by Judge Juan Merchan at the start of the trial to allow prosecutors to question Trump about several of his unrelated legal battles has created a dilemma for the former president. The decision means prosecutors can now interrogate Trump -- if he chooses to testify -- about his defamation case involving E. Jean Carroll or his civil fraud suit in an attempt to undermine Trump's credibility. Merchan has made clear that Trump has a Fifth Amendment right to decline to testify.\n\nCohen's credibility\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nCohen, for his part, went on a controversial media rampage in the lead-up to the trial and teased his forthcoming testimony while also aggressively criticizing Trump. Because of a gag order, Trump is restricted from responding publicly to Cohen's attacks.\n\nCohen's credibility has become a source of scrutiny in the hush money case.\n\nHe served as Trump's attorney and fixer in 2016. Two years later, he pleaded guilty to numerous federal crimes, including lying to a bank and Congress, as well as campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments for which Trump is now facing state charges.\n\nProsecutors have indicated that they expect Cohen to provide a firsthand account to jurors of how Trump was allegedly behind an illegal scheme to pay off Daniels. Cohen pleaded guilty for his role in the scheme in 2018, but federal prosecutors declined to charge Trump at the time.\n\nThose who have testified so far in the hush money case include former tabloid executive David Pecker, who spoke about his longtime \"catch-and-kill\" practice, which involved paying for the rights to stories, including two involving Trump, and then never publishing them in his magazines.\n\nKeith Davidson, a Los Angeles-based attorney who specializes in nondisclosure agreements, testified for several days about how he represented Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal as he negotiated payments for them in exchange for their silence about alleged affairs with Trump. Trump's attorneys have argued that hush-money payments are lawful.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nHope Hicks, who was intimately involved with the Trump campaign's day-to-day activities in 2016, took the stand for three hours on Friday and appeared nervous and at one point tearful, as she spoke about the campaign's scramble to course-correct Trump's image with women in the days ahead of the election.\n\nProsecutors have used witnesses like Hicks to help bolster their key allegation that Trump was motivated to make hush money payments to help his campaign. Trump's attorneys, however, secured cross-examination testimony from Hicks saying that Trump also had other motivations for wanting to keep the women quiet, including that he was worried about his wife Melania's opinion of him.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview in which he criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan Merchan said. Trump's statements, the judge continued, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings,\" Merchan said.\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors moving deeper into Trump's orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe trial entered its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n____\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Law Politics Criminal Law Trade Legislation Business The Economy Crime Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Magic Valley"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_r_sisak@magicvalley.com", "name": "Michael R.

Merchan fined the former president $1,000 and warned that going forward, additional violations could result in jail time. Prosecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nWitness testimony was set to resume following Merchan's ruling, setting the stage for an even deeper dive into the events and people involved in what prosecutors have said was a scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories about the then-candidate.\n\nThe trial is in its 12th day.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Hope Hicks took the stand last week, recounting how Trump's campaign was turned upside-down following the leak of a video wherein he bragged about grabbing women without their permission.\n\nKeith Davidson, who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: Terms to know in Trump trial\n\n-- What Trump's gag order means in his hush money case\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Hulk Hogan, hurricanes and a blockbuster recording: A week in the Trump hush money trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTHE COMMENT THAT VIOLATED THE GAG ORDER\n\nThe judge in Donald Trump's hush money case found on Monday that Donald Trump had violated his gag order with comments he gave to a program called \"Just the News No Noise\" on April 22, which is broadcast on Real America's Voice.\n\nOn the program, the former president criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats. \"The jury was picked so fast. 95 percent Democrats. The area's mostly all Democrat,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Juan M. Merchan said the comments \"not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\n\nThe gag order bars Trump from making comments about the jurors, key witnesses and some others connected to the criminal trial.\n\nJUDGE FINES TRUMP AGAIN FOR CONTEMPT, THREATENS JAIL TIME\n\nThe judge presiding over former President Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him an additional $1,000 for again violating a gag order barring him from making inflammatory comments about witnesses and jurors.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned on Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time.\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well,\" Merchan said. \"There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. Once the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nProsecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nThe judge had previously fined Trump $9,000 for nine earlier violations in posts on Truth Social and his website.\n\nTRUMP TALKS COLUMBIA COMMENCEMENT CANCELLATION BEFORE COURT\n\nBefore heading into the courtroom Monday morning, Donald Trump spoke to reporters, relaying familiar complaints about the fairness of the trial, the judge and the gag order that stops him commenting on witnesses and jurors.\n\nHe also noted the breaking news that Columbia University canceled its main commencement following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests.\n\n\"That shouldn't happen,\" he said.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan as witness testimony in his hush money trial enters its third week.\n\nWHO'S BEEN ON\n\nTHE STAND SO FAR\n\nWitness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial is entering its third week on Monday and it remains to be seen who will take the stand next.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, jurors have heard from a host of different people.\n\nFollowing a weeklong jury selection process that began mid-April, jurors heard first from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who among other things explained his pledge to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nFormer White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks on Friday painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nTHE WITNESS HEARD, BUT NOT YET SEEN\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nTRUMP EXPECTED IN COURT AS TRIAL ENTERS 12TH DAY\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case. A second contempt hearing was held on Thursday over four more prospective violations, but Merchan did not immediately issue a decision.\n\nThe Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "sudbury.com",

Some witnesses have been able to narrate the evidence to the jury, sharing what was going through their head at the time of the text message or email entered into evidence. Other evidence has been introduced by custodians -- witnesses called by prosecutors to authenticate records -- who were not direct participants in the events and are unable to provide the same kind of context for the evidence.\n\nTrump is on trial for allegedly falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. The former president has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have vowed that by the end of their case, the jurors will have a full picture of Trump's conduct and \"inescapably\" reach the conclusion that the former president is guilty.\n\n\"I am sure we can all agree that media accounts may be inaccurate or only tell parts of the story,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass advised potential jurors last month about their pre-existing knowledge of the case. \"After all, the media has not yet had access to the evidence that you are going to see in this case.\"\n\nHere are eight pieces of the evidence that jurors have already seen during the trial, contextualized by witness testimony and background events.\n\nPX-218: Email from reporter about 'Access Hollywood' tape, Oct. 7, 2016\n\nProsecutors argued to the jury that the October 2016 release of the Access Hollywood tape -- where Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals -- launched Trump's campaign into panic mode.\n\n\"I think there was consensus among us all that the tape was damaging, and this was a crisis,\" former campaign press secretary Hope Hicks testified.\n\nDuring Hicks' testimony, jurors saw the email from a Washington Post reporter requesting a comment about Trump's remarks before the newspaper broke the story.\n\nIn an email to then-campaign staffers Jason Miller, Kellyanne Conway, and Stephen Bannon, Hicks laid out an initial strategy.\n\n\"FLAGGING. 1) Need to hear the tape to be sure. 2) Deny, deny, deny,\" Hicks wrote in the email.\n\n\"Strategy number two was going to be a little more difficult,\" Hicks told jurors when asked about the email.\n\nTrump issued a video statement apologizing for his remarks, but the story dominated the news cycle for the following day.\n\n\"We were anticipating a Category 4 hurricane making landfall somewhere on the East Coast, and I don't think anybody remembers where or when that hurricane made landfall,\" Hicks said about the weekend when the news broke. \"It was all Trump, all the time, for the next 36 hours.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the news set into motion a series of events including Trump's effort to kill Stormy Daniels' allegations of an affair, denied by Trump, and his eventual criminal indictment for concealing information from voters.\n\nPX-176A: Texts regarding 'Access Hollywood' tape, Oct. 8, 2016\n\nAs news broke about Trump's remarks on the Access Hollywood tape, attorney Keith Davidson -- who represented both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal who also alleged an affair with Trump-- reacted to the development in a text message exchange with the former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard.\n\n\"Trump is f----,\" Davidson wrote.\n\n\"Wave the white flag. It's over people,\" Howard replied.\n\nDavidson testified last week that a business opportunity soon emerged from the reputational rubble of the Access Hollywood tape, as Daniels' agent began shopping around the story of Trump's alleged affair with the adult film actress.\n\n\"It wasn't until 'Access Hollywood' that interest sort of reached a crescendo,' Davidson testified about Daniels' story.\n\nDavidson testified that over the coming weeks, he began negotiating a deal with Michael Cohen to buy the rights to the story, to guarantee Daniels' silence, for $130,000.\n\nPX-409B: Clip from Trump rally, Oct. 14, 2016\n\nAs Davidson and Cohen negotiated the rights for Daniels' story, the Trump campaign continued with its whirlwind schedule of rallies in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nJurors last week saw a clip of Trump's remarks at an Oct. 14, 2016, campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, where Trump appeared to recognize the impact of the allegations on his electoral odds.\n\n\"These are all horrible lies, all fabricated, and we can't let them change the most important election in our lifetimes,\" Trump said. \"If just 5% of the people think it's true and maybe 10% we don't, we don't win.\"\n\nProsecutors argued that Trump's remarks demonstrated his motivation to kill Daniels' story.\n\nPX-276, PX-376: Documents related to Daniels payment, Oct. 26-27, 2016\n\nJust days before the 2016 election, Cohen successfully negotiated the rights to buy Stormy Daniels' story for $130,000. Davidson testified that while Cohen made the payment using his own money, he believed Trump would ultimately fund -- and be the beneficiary of -- the payment.\n\nJurors saw the wire transfer authorization form from Cohen's shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, to Keith Davidson's trust account for Stormy Daniels.\n\nJurors also saw a signed confidential settlement agreement between David Dennison and Peggy Peterson, pseudonyms Davidson said he created for Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels.\n\nHope Hicks testified that Donald Trump told her in 2018 that he believed Cohen made the payment \"out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\n\"I would say that would be out of character for Michael,\" Hicks told jurors about Trump's assertion. \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person. He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nPX-179: Photo of Pecker and Trump at White House, July 11, 2017\n\nAfter winning the election, Donald Trump continued to keep an eye on the allegations of infidelity, according to the former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.\n\nPecker told jurors that he entered into an agreement with Trump and Cohen in the early days of the Trump campaign to serve as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" by looking out for negative stories about Trump related to women. Pecker testified that, as part of that agreement to help the Trump campaign, his company American Media Inc. had purchased the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story of an alleged affair, denied by Trump, for $150,000 in August 2016.\n\nIn the months following the election, Pecker said that Trump invited him to the White House for a \"thank you dinner.\" Jurors saw a July 2017 photo of Pecker and Trump walking together along the White House colonnade.\n\n\"At the time to have dinner, Mr. Trump asked me to join him in a walk from the Oval Office to the dining area. We passed the Rose Garden,\" Pecker told jurors. \"And as we walked out, President Trump asked me, 'How is Karen doing?'\"\n\n\"'So, I said, 'She's doing well. She's quiet. Everything is going good,'\" Pecker recounted to jurors.\n\nPX-181: Journal article on Daniels payment, Jan. 12, 2018\n\nDespite Stormy Daniels staying quiet for more than a year after the 2016 election, the story of Cohen's hush money payment to the adult film actress broke in 2018.\n\nJurors saw the article from the Wall Street Journal about the payment, which was published under the headline, \"Trump Lawyer Arranged $130,000 Payment for Adult-Film Star's Silence.\"\n\nHope Hicks testified about Trump's reaction to the story.\n\n\"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story -- a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment,\" Hicks told jurors. \"And I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nPX-278: A later-recanted statement from Daniels, Jan. 30, 2018\n\nWeeks after the Wall Street Journal broke the story of Cohen's hush-money payment, Daniels was scheduled to appear on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\n\n\"She wanted to talk about her life and reinvigorate her career,\" Davidson told jurors.\n\nJurors saw text messages from Cohen and Davidson, who attempted to coordinate a denial statement ahead of the late-night appearance.\n\n\"Michael Cohen had requested yet another statement from Stormy Daniels and on the day that she was appearing on Jimmy Kimmel, and he wanted to know whether or not she was going to release it,\" Davidson told jurors.\n\nJurors saw the statement that Davidson drafted for Daniels, which was put out hours before Daniels went on the show.\n\n\"I had a pretty clear idea of what I wanted to ask you tonight but then about like three hours ago I go on the internet and I see this letter that pops up,\" Kimmel asked Daniels on the show. \"Did you sign this letter that was released today?\"\n\n\"I don't know, did I?\" Daniels said. \"That does not look like my signature, does it?\"\n\nThough jurors have not seen the footage of the Kimmel appearance, they saw Cohen's immediate response.\n\n\"She just denied the letter,\" Cohen texted Davidson.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him $1,000 for violating his gag order and sternly warned the former president that additional violation could result in jail time.\n\nThe fine marks the second sanction for Trump for inflammatory comments about witnesses since the start of the trial last month. He was fined $9,000 last week for nine violations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time, though he said that was \"the last thing I want to do.\"\n\nProsecutors in Trump's hush money trial are moving deeper into his orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nHer testimony Friday was designed to give jurors an insider's view of a chaotic and pivotal stretch in the campaign, when a 2005 recording showing Trump talking about grabbing women without their permission was made public and when he and his allies sought to prevent the release of other potentially embarrassing stories. That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n____\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "journalnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winston-Salem Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_tucker@journalnow.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@journalnow.com", "name": "Michael R.

Hicks also testified that Trump's electoral standing with women was a concern for the campaign at the time Michael Cohen paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. Trump denies Daniels' claim that they had sex in 2006.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump ignores question about whether he'll testify\n\nFormer President Donald Trump blasted the judge again Monday before entering the courtroom, but ignored a reporter's question about whether he would testify at his hush money trial.\n\nTrump was also asked whether his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, was a liar, one of his common descriptions. But Trump said he couldn't speak about Cohen because of Judge Juan Merchan's gag order against commenting on potential witnesses.\n\n\"As you know, they've taken away my constitutional rights, so I'm not allowed to answer that question,\" Trump said.\n\nReporters in Miami over the weekend asked Trump about the trial, but he said he couldn't answer them either.\n\n\"I have to say I've got a gag order,\" Trump said. \"I can't speak about it. Never happened before, ever.\"\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n'Good morning Mr. Trump'\n\nJudge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom at 9:27 a.m. EDT for Day 12 of Donald Trump's criminal trial. As usual, Merchan said \"Good morning\" generally to the prosecution and defense teams, and a specific \"Good morning, Mr. Trump\" to the former president.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump's $9,000 gag order fines paid\n\nWe are still waiting for Judge Juan Merchan to rule on prosecutors' allegations that Trump has violated the gag order in this case four additional times. That ruling could come today.\n\nHowever, Merchan has already ruled Trump violated the order nine times, and on Friday a court spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY that the $9,000 in fines for those violations have been paid.\n\nMerchan held Trump in criminal contempt as part of the earlier gag order ruling, and warned the former president that future violations could mean jail time.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat does Trump's trial schedule look like?\n\nTrump's hush money trial is expected to last six to eight weeks, according to a media advisory from New York's Unified Court System. The courtroom normally opens at 9:30 a.m. eastern time, and the court takes off on Wednesday's.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ruled Tuesday that court will break on May 17 so Trump can attend his son Barron Trump's high school graduation, and on May 24 due to a juror scheduling conflict.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen does the Trump trial resume?\n\nThe court is expected to reconvene Monday morning at 9:30 a.m., where testimony in Trump's hush money trial will resume.\n\nThough a witness will take the stand Monday, it is not clear who that person will be.\n\nLast week, former Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks got emotional on the stand as Trump lawyer Emily Bove began asking her questions on cross-examination.\n\nPrevious witnesses in the trial include Former National Enquirer boss David Pecker and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented porn star Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal.\n\nS udiksha Kochi\n\nTrump Media auditor fined $12 million for 'massive fraud': SEC\n\nThe accountants for Donald Trump's media company Truth Social were charged with \"massive fraud\" and fined millions of dollars, but Trump's company wasn't charged with wrongdoing, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.\n\nBF Borgers and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, were charged with fraud that affected 1,500 SEC filings, including those of Trump Media, the SEC said. The company agreed to pay a $12 million civil penalty and Borgers agreed to pay $2 million, and both agreed to stop auditing.\n\nBorgers didn't properly prepare or maintain audit documentation, fabricated audit planning meetings and sometimes passed off previous audits for current ones, the SEC said.\n\n\"Trump Media looks forward to working with new auditing partners,\" the company announced in a statement.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWhy did Hope Hicks start crying?\n\nHicks' emotional breakdown Friday happened soon after Trump lawyer Emil Bove began to ask her introductory questions. It wasn't clear what caused her emotions. It could have been facing questioning by the lawyer for her former boss, who could be imprisoned if convicted. It could also have been that something in the prosecution's earlier questions and her responses was sinking in.\n\nJust before Bove started his cross-examination, Hicks said in response to a prosecutor's question that Trump has asked her how a post-2016 election story about Michael Cohen's payment to Stormy Daniels \"was playing.\"\n\n\"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" Hicks said.\n\nThat is significant testimony for the prosecution, which is arguing that Trump committed felonies when he allegedly falsified business records because the purpose of the falsification was to cover up violating campaign finance laws through the $130,000 hush money payment. Trump may argue the payment wasn't about the election at all, but was instead designed to shield his family from an embarrassing story.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors allege he was covering up unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through a $130,000 hush money payment from his then-lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels says the two had sex shortly after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump, a claim the former president denies.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump

But Merchan warned him that his violation of the gag order is a \"direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nMerchan said that \"the last thing\" he wanted to do was to put Trump in jail but would if he had to, adding, \"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well.\"\n\nMerchan fined Trump another $1,000 for the violation of the gag order, on top of the $9,000 he fined him last week for another nine violations of the gag order. Last week, Merchan acknowledged that the penalty was a pittance for a billionaire like Trump.\n\nThe case was resuming Monday, with the 12-member jury yet to hear from two key witnesses in the case against the former U.S. president - his former lawyer and political fixer, convicted perjurer Michael Cohen, and Daniels.\n\nJurors have heard plenty of testimony about Cohen and Daniels during the last two weeks, but prosecutors have not tipped their hand when the pair might be called to the witness stand.\n\nJeffrey McConney, a former corporate controller at the Trump Organization, was the first witness called Monday. Prosecutors say he helped arrange the reimbursement to Cohen for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels; Trump claims the payment to Cohen was for his legal work.\n\nThe 77-year-old Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges. Prosecutors say the payment to Daniels was to keep her from talking about her claim that she had the affair with Trump just as voters were headed to polls eight years ago.\n\nTrump has denied the charges against him, but if convicted could be placed on probation or sentenced up to four years in prison. He is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee in the November 5 election, set to run again against President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020.\n\nTrump has also denied Daniels' claim they had a liaison after they met at a celebrity golf tournament at Lake Tahoe in Nevada. Until Merchan barred him from assailing possible witnesses in the case, Trump often called Daniels \"horseface.\" He was 60 and she 27 at the time she claims they had sex.\n\nLong-time Trump aide Hope Hicks testified Friday that the 2016 Trump campaign was in a state of panic in October that year, a month before the voting, as a 2005 outtake of the celebrity-driven \"Access Hollywood\" show was unearthed in which Trump boasted that he could sexually grope women with impunity because he was a star.\n\nAt the same time, Daniels was looking to sell her years-old story of sex with Trump or keep quiet about it before the election if she was paid to stay silent.\n\nCohen made the payment and said Trump later reimbursed him in monthly installments in 2017 after he became president.\n\nThe payments are central to the criminal case against Trump, which McConney has started to describe to jurors.\n\nHicks said that at one point Trump suggested to her that Cohen had made the hush money payment to Daniels unbeknownst to him and out of the kindness of his heart.\n\nBut Hicks, under questioning from prosecutor Joshua Steinglass, testified, \"I would say that would be out of character for Michael. I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person, um, or selfless person. Um, he's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nCohen, often depicted in testimony as abrasive, volatile and profane, pleaded guilty to a campaign finance violation linked to the case and other offenses. He served 13\u00bd months in a federal prison and another year and a half of home confinement.\n\nHe also has turned against his former boss and is seemingly set to tell the jury of his behind-the-scenes interactions over years of loyal work for Trump.\n\nTrump's defense lawyers are just as certain to brand Cohen as a liar and not to be believed as he testifies.\n\nOther witnesses are likely to describe how the reimbursement payments were made to Cohen and what role, if any, Trump played in listing them as for legal work rather than for paying off Daniels to silence her ahead of the election.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type":

Check back for updates throughout the day.\n\nThe New York criminal hush money trial of Donald Trump will resume Monday after a dramatic week bookended by testimony from a former top White House aide and a warning from the judge that Trump's rhetoric could land him in jail.\n\nOn Friday, former longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks testified for the prosecution under subpoena. She provided an insider's account of how Trump and his team reacted to damaging news about him on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. This included the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump was caught on tape bragging about sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Everyone was just absorbing the shock of it,\" Hicks said, describing the immediate aftermath of the tape's release.\n\nThat tape renewed media interest in porn star Stormy Daniels' little known account of a sexual encounter she said she says she had with Trump in 2006. For much of the week, the jury heard from a lawyer who helped broker a $130,000 hush money payment for Daniels. That payment is at the center of the prosecution's case.\n\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a reimbursement to his lawyer for the payment to Daniels. The $130,000 was paid by Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen, less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg accuses Trump of concealing records of the payment to further an illegal scheme to influence the election.\n\nHicks testified that while she was working in the Trump White House, the president told her that Cohen had made the payment without Trump's knowledge in order to protect him, and that he did it \"out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\nHicks said she thought acting out of pure kindness would be \"out of character for Michael.\"\n\nShe also suggested that Trump was pleased the Daniels story did not come out before the election. \"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" she testified.\n\nWhen Trump's attorneys began their cross-examination, asking her basic questions about her time at the Trump Organization, Hicks quickly broke down in tears on the witness stand.\n\nEarlier in the week, Judge Juan Merchan held Trump in criminal contempt of court for nine violations of a gag order barring him from speaking about witnesses, jurors and other parties involved in the trial.\n\nMerchan gave Trump the maximum fine of $1,000 for each violation. The judge's order acknowledged that that fine is hardly enough to be a deterrent to a defendant as wealthy as Trump. But Merchan noted that Trump could face jail time if he continues to violate court orders.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/05/107401126-1713188708904-107401126-1713188631640-gettyimages-2147828793-AFP_34PF862.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

They believed he was lying to them.\n\nTrump's attorney, Emil Bove, seriously damaged the credibility of Stormy Daniel's attorney, Keith Davidson. During a heated cross-examination, defense attorney Emil Bove managed to cast Keith Davidson, a former attorney for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, as a shady lawyer who gets as close to the line as he can without crossing it, brokering deals that border on extortion.\n\nAfter showing how Davidson has \"represented\" many clients in hush money cases, Bove said, \"You were pretty well versed in coming right up to the line without committing extortion, right?\"\n\nThe FBI has investigated Davidson after he told Hulk Hogan to pay his client $300,000 or a tape of him could be released.\n\nSo far, no witnesses can testify to an actual alleged Trump crime. The entire prosecution has been speculation.\n\nKeith Davidson believed Michael Cohen lied to him several times. As an aside, Michael Cohen is a convicted liar. Davidson shredded Michael Cohen's reputation.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Keith Davidson, Stormy's lawyer, said in court Thursday that the $130,000 payment to Daniels was not \"hush money\" but a \"consideration\" payment.\n\n\"Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false,\" the statement says. \"I don't believe that Stormy ever alleged that any interaction with Trump was 'romantic,'\" Davidson testified Thursday.\n\nDavidson added that he would never use \"hush money\" to describe the money exchange.\n\nDavidson said he would not use the term \"hush money\" to describe the payment to Daniels and would rather call it \"consideration\" in a civil settlement. Several media outlets have published stories with headlines that continue to refer to the trial as a \"hush money\" case.\n\nA \"consideration\" is a term in legal contracts. It is something given in return for the promise of abiding by a contract. The payment was called \"legal fees\" in Trump's accounting, which is what Democrats claim was fraud.\n\nThat's the 34 counts. The case should never have gone to trial and certainly should have been dismissed.\n\nIf Daniels didn't consider the payment \"hush money,\" then there was no reason for Trump's lawyers to falsify accounting papers. The charges leveled at Trump seem a stretch at best. This testimony should certainly lead to this case wrapping up as a vindication for Trump.\n\nHowever, it's a corrupt Democrat judge, crooked Democrat prosecutors bent on destroying Trump, and a seemingly Democrat jury that gets their news from the corrupt NY Times.\n\nAnother key point came when Bove asked Davidson if he recalled saying Stormy Daniels had \"settler's remorse\" or ever used the word \"leverage\" in a conversation with Cohen. Davidson was asked to listen to portions of the conversation -- which Cohen had recorded without his knowledge at the time -- after he said he could not recall the details.\n\nOn the witness stand, Hicks testified that Cohen \"used to like to call himself Mr. Fix It, but it was only because he first broke it.\"\n\nMichael Colangelo is a lawyer for the prosecution and a former high-ranking official in the Justice Department who left a great job for a demotion and less money. Why? He wanted to prosecute Trump.\n\nColangelo questioned Hicks. He asked Trump's former 2016 press secretary about Trump's reaction to the \"Access Hollywood\" tape before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhy was that allowed in? The Access Hollywood tape has NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CASE! They want to use thought crimes to convict him. They want him judged by his reactions years before, not evidence. This is their idea of a motive for the \"consideration\" payment. Hicks testified that Trump's main concern was the reaction it would have on his wife, just as Trump has said.\n\nBove asked Hicks about the impact on Trump's family. \"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed about anything on the campaign. He wanted them to be proud of him,\" she responded.\n\nIt's humorous to think she's a prosecution witness.", "source": {"uri": "independentsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.independentsentinel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_dowling@independentsentinel.com", "name": "M Dowling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.independentsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/trump.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan said before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Trump's statements, the judge added, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nThe violation in this case stems from an April 22 interview with television channel Real America's Voice in which Trump criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats.\n\n\"That jury was picked so fast -- 95% Democrats,\" Trump said at the time. \"The area's mostly all Democrat. You think of it as a, just a purely Democrat area. It's a very unfair situation that I can tell you.\"\n\nRelated Story: Liar, Liar: Potential Trump VP Pick Noem's Claims Are on Fire\n\nMeanwhile, testimony resumed Monday with prosecutors calling to the stand Jeffrey McConney, the former Trump Organization controller.\n\nHe retired from the company last year after 36 years after being granted immunity to testify for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial, where he admitted breaking the law to help fellow executives avoid taxes on company-paid perks. The company was convicted and is appealing.\n\nThe testimony follows an inside-the-room account given to jurors Friday about Trump's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election.

The DA's office has been keeping that information close to the vest, telling New York state Judge Juan Merchan it has concerns that Trump might post about the witnesses on social media.\n\nMerchan found Trump in criminal contempt last week for violating a gag order barring him from making \"public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.\" The violations included posts about two likely witnesses, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen and adult film star Stormy Daniels, both of whom are at the heart of the DA's case.\n\nMerchan fined Trump $9,000, which he paid Thursday, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said.\n\nLast week brought dramatic testimony from former top Trump aide Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented Daniels and Karen McDougal, women who claim they had sexual encounters with the married Trump in 2006. Trump has denied their claims. Both received six-figure payments to keep quiet about their claims during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMcDougal, a former Playboy model, was paid $150,000 through National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, and Cohen paid Daniels $130,000. Trump eventually repaid Cohen through payments the DA says were falsely labeled as legal fees. He has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nHicks, a longtime former Trump aide, broke down in tears while she was answering a question about first going to work for Trump's company in 2014. She testified that Trump told her he hadn't known about Cohen's payment because he'd kept it to himself. She indicated she was skeptical of that claim.\n\n\"I did not know Michael to be an especially charitable or selfless person. He is a kind of person who seeks credit,\" she said. On cross-examination, she also said he'd often try to insert himself into the campaign, which annoyed campaign staffers. \"He liked to call himself a 'fixer' or 'Mr. Fix-it,' and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to come and fix it,\" she said.\n\nDavidson testified about his dealings with Pecker and Cohen, who he said complained to him in December 2016 that Trump hadn't yet reimbursed him for the hush money payment.\n\nDavidson, who was largely monotone for most of his two days of testimony, got into some heated exchanges with Trump attorney Emil Bove, who pressed him about clients in other salacious tabloid stories he'd been involved with over the years, including a person alleged to have leaked information about actor Lindsay Lohan's stint in rehab, clients who peddled sex tapes featuring wrestler Hulk Hogan and influencer Tila Tequila and various claims involving actor Charlie Sheen.\n\nDavidson was evasive with his answers to Bove, saying he couldn't remember details. \"I had over 1,500 clients in my career,\" he said.\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement that Trump, Cohen and Pecker conspired in a bid to influence the 2016 election and that Trump \"covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.\"\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche said in his opening statement that nondisclosure agreements are legal and that there was nothing criminal about Trump's payments to Cohen. As for the conspiracy allegations, Blanche said, \"I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type":

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org",

Merchan will hold a hearing over four more online posts that prosecutors say violate the court's mandate barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors or key witnesses in the case. Merchan already found Trump in contempt of court on Tuesday, fining him $9,000 over nine online posts and threatening him with jail time if he continues violating the gag order.\n\nIt's unclear when Merchan might rule on the new sanctions request. The trial is in its 10th day.\n\nKeith Davidson is expected to return to the stand after dominating Tuesday's witness testimony, outlining how he negotiated hush money deals with the National Enquirer and Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, on behalf of former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nProsecutors have said that Trump and others conducted a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election by purchasing and burying salacious stories that might hurt his campaign.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including $130,000 given to Daniels by Cohen -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nThe trial is expected to last another month or more, with jurors hearing testimony four days a week. Donald Trump -- who has cast the prosecution as an effort to hurt his 2024 campaign -- is required to be there, much to his stated dismay.\n\n\"They don't want me on the campaign trail,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nThe judge said Tuesday that there will be no court on May 17 so Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nCourt also won't be in session on May 24 to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, the judge said. That means the trial will be off for four straight days for the Memorial Day weekend, resuming on May 28.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money deals with Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer, returns to the witness stand on Thursday.\n\nHis testimony dominated Tuesday afternoon as he outlined the sequence of events that led up to the agreements, including his first interactions with Cohen, who was then Trump's lawyer and personal fixer. Among other things, Davidson testified that pseudonyms were used in the deal with Daniels and that Cohen was late in delivering the agreed-upon $130,000 payment for Daniels.\n\nHe also testified that he thought Daniels' story would be a \"tornado\" if it got out.\n\nDaniels has alleged that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 while McDougal alleged a yearlong affair with him. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nDuring a one-day break in Donald Trump's historic hush money trial, the former president lashed out at the judge overseeing the case and complained about a gag order that bars him from speaking publicly about key witnesses and others.\n\n\"There is no crime. I have a crooked judge, is a totally conflicted judge,\" Trump told supporters at a Waukesha, Wisconsin, event on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the gag order pertains to speaking publicly about jurors, key witnesses and others in the case, Trump remains free to criticize Merchan.\n\nWitness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial is set to resume Thursday, but only after a hearing on more potential gag order violations takes place.\n\nProsecutors have said that Trump, in four new online posts, again violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about jurors, witnesses and others in the hush money case. Judge Juan M. Merchan already sanctioned the former president on Tuesday for nine online posts, fining him $9,000 and threatening him with jail time if he continues violating the order.\n\nThe sanctions -- and the prospect of more -- highlight the difficulty Trump has had adjusting to his court responsibilities as a criminal defendant while also campaigning as the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.", "source": {"uri": "accesswdun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Access WDUN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanctions (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waukesha,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waukesha, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waukesha, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://7b1de02a7bcf9c1df487-6849f9022b05f72b83236695aa4e9a0a.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploads/ap/2024/1240856/image-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1894, "textEnd": 1900}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1997, "textEnd": 2003}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 2172, "textEnd": 2178}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nHere's some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA political hurricane ... and an actual one\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about groping women without their permission.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Southwest Airlines considering changes to its quirky boarding, pick-your-own seating practices Cardinals games dropped by Comcast after Bally Sports deal falls through Busch Stadium needs renovations.

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\n0 Comments Tags Wire Dcc Lee-national", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Some witnesses have been able to narrate the evidence to the jury, sharing what was going through their head at the time of the text message or email entered into evidence. Other evidence has been introduced by custodians -- witnesses called by prosecutors to authenticate records -- who were not direct participants in the events and are unable to provide the same kind of context for the evidence.\n\nTrump is on trial for allegedly falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. The former president has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have vowed that by the end of their case, the jurors will have a full picture of Trump's conduct and \"inescapably\" reach the conclusion that the former president is guilty.\n\n\"I am sure we can all agree that media accounts may be inaccurate or only tell parts of the story,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass advised potential jurors last month about their pre-existing knowledge of the case. \"After all, the media has not yet had access to the evidence that you are going to see in this case.\"\n\nHere are eight pieces of the evidence that jurors have already seen during the trial, contextualized by witness testimony and background events.\n\nPX-218: Email from reporter about 'Access Hollywood' tape, Oct. 7, 2016\n\nProsecutors argued to the jury that the October 2016 release of the Access Hollywood tape -- where Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals -- launched Trump's campaign into panic mode.\n\n\"I think there was consensus among us all that the tape was damaging, and this was a crisis,\" former campaign press secretary Hope Hicks testified.\n\nDuring Hicks' testimony, jurors saw the email from a Washington Post reporter requesting a comment about Trump's remarks before the newspaper broke the story.\n\nIn an email to then-campaign staffers Jason Miller, Kellyanne Conway, and Stephen Bannon, Hicks laid out an initial strategy.\n\n\"FLAGGING. 1) Need to hear the tape to be sure. 2) Deny, deny, deny,\" Hicks wrote in the email.\n\n\"Strategy number two was going to be a little more difficult,\" Hicks told jurors when asked about the email.\n\nTrump issued a video statement apologizing for his remarks, but the story dominated the news cycle for the following day.\n\n\"We were anticipating a Category 4 hurricane making landfall somewhere on the East Coast, and I don't think anybody remembers where or when that hurricane made landfall,\" Hicks said about the weekend when the news broke. \"It was all Trump, all the time, for the next 36 hours.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the news set into motion a series of events including Trump's effort to kill Stormy Daniels' allegations of an affair, denied by Trump, and his eventual criminal indictment for concealing information from voters.\n\nPX-176A: Texts regarding 'Access Hollywood' tape, Oct. 8, 2016\n\nAs news broke about Trump's remarks on the Access Hollywood tape, attorney Keith Davidson -- who represented both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal who also alleged an affair with Trump- reacted to the development in a text message exchange with the former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard.\n\n\"Trump is f -- -,\" Davidson wrote.\n\n\"Wave the white flag. It's over people,\" Howard replied.\n\nDavidson testified last week that a business opportunity soon emerged from the reputational rubble of the Access Hollywood tape, as Daniels' agent began shopping around the story of Trump's alleged affair with the adult film actress.\n\n\"It wasn't until 'Access Hollywood' that interest sort of reached a crescendo,' Davidson testified about Daniels' story.\n\nDavidson testified that over the coming weeks, he began negotiating a deal with Michael Cohen to buy the rights to the story, to guarantee Daniels' silence, for $130,000.\n\nPX-409B: Clip from Trump rally, Oct. 14, 2016\n\nAs Davidson and Cohen negotiated the rights for Daniels' story, the Trump campaign continued with its whirlwind schedule of rallies in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nJurors last week saw a clip of Trump's remarks at an Oct. 14, 2016, campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, where Trump appeared to recognize the impact of the allegations on his electoral odds.\n\n\"These are all horrible lies, all fabricated, and we can't let them change the most important election in our lifetimes,\" Trump said. \"If just 5% of the people think it's true and maybe 10% we don't, we don't win.\"\n\nProsecutors argued that Trump's remarks demonstrated his motivation to kill Daniels' story.\n\nPX-276, PX-376: Documents related to Daniels payment, Oct. 26-27, 2016\n\nJust days before the 2016 election, Cohen successfully negotiated the rights to buy Stormy Daniels' story for $130,000. Davidson testified that while Cohen made the payment using his own money, he believed Trump would ultimately fund -- and be the beneficiary of -- the payment.\n\nJurors saw the wire transfer authorization form from Cohen's shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, to Keith Davidson's trust account for Stormy Daniels.\n\nJurors also saw a signed confidential settlement agreement between David Dennison and Peggy Peterson, pseudonyms Davidson said he created for Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels.\n\nHope Hicks testified that Donald Trump told her in 2018 that he believed Cohen made the payment \"out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\n\"I would say that would be out of character for Michael,\" Hicks told jurors about Trump's assertion. \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person. He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nPX-179: Photo of Pecker and Trump at White House, July 11, 2017\n\nAfter winning the election, Donald Trump continued to keep an eye on the allegations of infidelity, according to the former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.\n\nPecker told jurors that he entered into an agreement with Trump and Cohen in the early days of the Trump campaign to serve as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" by looking out for negative stories about Trump related to women. Pecker testified that, as part of that agreement to help the Trump campaign, his company American Media Inc. had purchased the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story of an alleged affair, denied by Trump, for $150,000 in August 2016.\n\nIn the months following the election, Pecker said that Trump invited him to the White House for a \"thank you dinner.\" Jurors saw a July 2017 photo of Pecker and Trump walking together along the White House colonnade.\n\n\"At the time to have dinner, Mr. Trump asked me to join him in a walk from the Oval Office to the dining area. We passed the Rose Garden,\" Pecker told jurors. \"And as we walked out, President Trump asked me, 'How is Karen doing?'\"\n\n\"'So, I said, 'She's doing well. She's quiet. Everything is going good,'\" Pecker recounted to jurors.\n\nPX-181: Journal article on Daniels payment, Jan. 12, 2018\n\nDespite Stormy Daniels staying quiet for more than a year after the 2016 election, the story of Cohen's hush money payment to the adult film actress broke in 2018.\n\nJurors saw the article from the Wall Street Journal about the payment, which was published under the headline, \"Trump Lawyer Arranged $130,000 Payment for Adult-Film Star's Silence.\"\n\nHope Hicks testified about Trump's reaction to the story.\n\n\"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story -- a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment,\" Hicks told jurors. \"And I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nPX-278: A later-recanted statement from Daniels, Jan. 30, 2018\n\nWeeks after the Wall Street Journal broke the story of Cohen's hush-money payment, Daniels was scheduled to appear on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\n\n\"She wanted to talk about her life and reinvigorate her career,\" Davidson told jurors.\n\nJurors saw text messages from Cohen and Davidson, who attempted to coordinate a denial statement ahead of the late-night appearance.\n\n\"Michael Cohen had requested yet another statement from Stormy Daniels and on the day that she was appearing on Jimmy Kimmel, and he wanted to know whether or not she was going to release it,\" Davidson told jurors.\n\nJurors saw the statement that Davidson drafted for Daniels, which was put out hours before Daniels went on the show.\n\n\"I had a pretty clear idea of what I wanted to ask you tonight but then about like three hours ago I go on the internet and I see this letter that pops up,\" Kimmel asked Daniels on the show. \"Did you sign this letter that was released today?\"\n\n\"I don't know, did I?\" Daniels said. \"That does not look like my signature, does it?\"\n\nThough jurors have not seen the footage of the Kimmel appearance, they saw Cohen's immediate response.\n\n\"She just denied the letter,\" Cohen texted Davidson.", "source": {"uri": "mix1027.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)",

Remarkably, six months later, in a courthouse around the corner, Trump was again threatened with prison time.\n\nThe defendant is hereby put on notice that the court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and appropriate in the circumstances it will impose a term of imprisonment, wrote Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees Trump's criminal trial. when Trump was in office, he violated his latest order of silence.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former president was fined $9,000 and held in contempt of court, a felony that has a criminal record, for violating Mercans' silence order. Under the silence, Trump cannot speak publicly about prosecutors, witnesses, jurors, court personnel and their relatives. Prosecutors argued that Trump violated the order ten times. Merchan ruled he had nine violations.\n\nAlthough this is the second trial in New York that Trump has participated in and this time it is a criminal trial, not a civil one and his presence is not optional, it appears that the former president did not learn many lessons from his fraud trial regarding appeasing judges.\n\nTrump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records, allegedly marking a hush money payment as a legal service fee on business records. The $130,000 payment was made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up her story of an alleged affair with Trump in 2006 during the 2016 election. While her criminal case is heard by a jury, s If he is found guilty, Merchan will decide his sentence, which could include prison time.\n\nThe trial has completed its third week, its second week of testimony. Seven witnesses have already testified. It is unclear whether Trump will testify. But it's clear he will test Mercans' tattered patience to its limits.\n\nProsecutors said Thursday that Trump has already violated the silence order four times, twice for comments about Michael Cohen, Trump's former consigliere turned b\u00eate noire and a future witness in the case, as well as a comment about the jury and another about David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc (AMI) and publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified at the trial last week. Prosecutors said they were not seeking jail time, which would delay proceedings, but were seeking further fines. Merchan did not rule on these additional violations of the silence order.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, reiterated that Trump was responding to attacks leveled against him.\n\nEveryone can say whatever they want except President Trump, Blanche said.\n\nAs if these nuances of past trials weren't enough, Trump found himself once again in a courtroom on Thursday, listening to the voice of Michael Cohen.\n\nHe had been sitting just feet from Cohen for more than six months when his former fixer, once his most loyal disciple, testified against him at his fraud trial. And on Thursday, Cohen's voice echoed in a courtroom again.\n\nI need to open a company for the transfer of all this information about our friend David, Cohen said in a 2016 audio recording, presumably referring to Pecker, the former National Enquirer editor who helped him facilitate the secret payments during the 2016 election.\n\nAlthough Cohen himself was not present in the courtroom, his presence was prominent during the witnesses' testimony. Cohen served as an intermediary between Pecker and Trump, and it was Cohen who ultimately paid Daniels to kill his story.\n\nThe two biggest witnesses in the trial so far, Pecker and Keith Davidson, a former lawyer for Daniels, and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who Pecker paid $150,000 to keep silent about his alleged 2006 affair along with Trump, both highlighted Cohen's key role in quashing the stories.\n\nIt's unclear when prosecutors will call Cohen to testify, but they are already preparing to attack his reliability as a witness. Cohen was sentenced in 2018 to three years in prison for Trump-related crimes, including violating campaign finance laws and lying to Congress.\n\nStay informed on all Donald Trump trials.

During his testimony at Trump's fraud trial in the fall, Cohen said he did not commit tax evasion, even though he pleaded guilty to the crime in 2018.\n\nTrump's lawyers have already suggested they are prepared to attack the credibility of star witnesses, attempting to portray Cohen as a disgruntled former employee seeking revenge. But on Tuesday, prosecutors seemed to want to anticipate their attacks.\n\nWhen Davidson was on the witness stand Thursday, prosecutors asked him to tell the jury about a 2016 phone call he had with Cohen after the election.\n\nJesus Christ, can you believe I'm not going to Washington? Davidson remembers Cohen telling him. After everything I've done for this fucking guy, I can't believe I'm not going to Washington.\n\nAlthough prosecutors asked Davidson to confirm that Cohen was in fact a disgruntled employee, he and other witnesses also confirmed that Cohen played a key role in quashing negative stories about Trump and handling the payment secret at the center of the affair.\n\nAnd even if Trump's lawyers are aggressive toward Cohen on the stand, as they were during his testimony last fall, prosecutors made clear last week that they have additional evidence to support their case .\n\nWould you be willing to break with the whole Trump Doctrine, so to speak? Are you completely rogue? Cohen lamented Davidson in a 2016 audio recording. Nobody thinks about Michael.\n\nAs we enter the fourth week of Trump's criminal trial, Cohen can rest assured that a lot of people are thinking about Michael. Especially Donald Trump.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

May 6, 2024.\n\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nThis is developing news. Check back for updates throughout the day.\n\nA judge issued a dire warning to Donald Trump on Monday: Stop violating court orders or you will be thrown in jail.\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States, and maybe the next president as well,\" Judge Juan Merchan told Trump in Manhattan Supreme Court , where the former president sits. trial in hush money criminal case.\n\n\"I don't want to propose a prison sentence,\" Merchan said, but \"I will, if necessary.\"\n\nThe ultimatum came less than a week after the judge found Trump in contempt of court for nine violations of his silence order, which prohibits him from speaking about witnesses, jurors and other parties involved in the trial.\n\nOn Monday morning, Merchan again scorned Trump for claiming in an April 22 radio interview that the trial was \"very unfair\" because the jury was chosen from an area that was \"predominantly all-Democratic.\"\n\nBy making this assertion, Trump \"not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy, of these proceedings, but once again raised the specter of fear for the safety of jurors and their loved ones,\" Merchan wrote in her decision.\n\nMerchan fined Trump a maximum of $1,000 for the latest violation of the hush order, giving him a total of $10,000 in fines for 10 separate offenses.\n\nTrump is also \"warned that if appropriate and justified, future violations of his lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration,\" Merchan ruled.\n\nThe judge acknowledged before rendering his decision that \"it appears that the $1,000 fines are not a deterrent.\"\n\nBut he said he would not hastily take the drastic step of throwing Trump in jail for his continued defiance.\n\n\"The magnitude of such a decision is not lost on me,\" Merchan said.\n\n\"There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for you,\" he said. \"Taking this step would disrupt the procedure.\"\n\n\"But at the end of the day, I have a job to do.\"\n\nProsecutors then called Jeff McConney, the former longtime controller of the Trump Organization, to the witness stand. McConney, who worked under the company's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, previously gave emotional testimony at a civil business fraud trial against Trump in New York.\n\nThe tense start to the fourth week of the historic trial followed a series of other dramatic developments, including a breakdown on the witness stand for a former top White House aide.\n\nTrump Organization Comptroller Jeffrey McConney leaves the New York State Supreme Court in New York, U.S., Friday, October 6, 2023.\n\nMichael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, Hope Hicks, a former longtime Trump aide, testified for the prosecution under subpoena. She provided an insider account of how Trump and his team responded to damaging news about him during the 2016 presidential campaign. This included the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump was filmed bragging about sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Everyone was just absorbing the shock,\" Hickss said, describing how she broke the news to the campaign.\n\nThe tape renewed media interest in porn star Stormy Daniels' little-known account of a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump in 2006. For much of the week, the jury heard a lawyer who helped negotiate a secret $130,000 payment for Daniels. . This payment is at the center of the prosecution's case.\n\nFormer White House Communications Director Hope Hicks leaves the hearing room during a break during a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee June 19, 2019 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.\n\nAlex Wong | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a reimbursement from his lawyer for the payment to Daniels. The $130,000 was paid by Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg accuses Trump of concealing records of the payment in order to further a illegal scheme to influence elections.\n\nHicks testified that while she worked in the Trump White House, Trump told her that Cohen made the payment without Trump's knowledge in order to protect him, and that he did it \"out of the goodness of his heart \".\n\nHicks said she thought acting out of pure kindness would be \"out of character for Michael.\"\n\nShe also suggested that Trump was happy that Daniels' story had not been made public before the election. \"I think Mr. Trump's view was that it was better to deal with it now and that it would have been bad for this story to have been made public before the election,\" she testified.\n\nRead more about Trump's secret

Joe Biden posed alongside actor Mark Hamill in the White House, while the North Carolina Republican Party depicted Trump as \"A New Hope\" in a Star Wars-themed post (which drew mockery for seeming to inadvertently cast him as a villain).\n\nBut the \"Hope\" that will be on the mind of jurors at the beginning of the 12th day of Trump's trial is Hope Hicks, his former senior aide who broke down into tears on the stand while testifying Friday about how the campaign responded to the explosive emergence of the Access Hollywood tape -- in which Trump boasted about groping women -- on the eve of the 2016 election.\n\nHicks said she knew the tape was \"going to be a massive story\" and that it would be \"a damaging development.\" The infamous recording had also figured earlier in the week in the testimony of lawyer Keith Davidson, who said it had had a \"tremendous influence\" on the interest in claims being made by his client, porn star Stormy Daniels, of an alleged affair with Trump.\n\nTrump denies having sex with Daniels and has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors claim Trump's business falsely recorded as legal expenses payments to Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen that were actually reimbursements for a $130,000 payment Cohen had made to Daniels in order to buy her silence about the affair.\n\nThe first weeks of testimony in the trial have seen the prosecution attempt to establish that Trump used hush-money payments to prevent damaging stories from coming to light in order to protect his 2016 bid for the White House and therefore unlawfully influence the election.\n\nTrump's defense team, on the other hand, has worked to undermine the theory that Trump was behind a conspiracy to protect his campaign and have questioned the credibility of some of the witnesses in the case.\n\nIt's not yet clear who could take the stand this week, but some key expected witnesses have yet to testify. They include Daniels and Cohen, two of the figures at the heart of the prosecution's case.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial, could also rule at any time on allegations that Trump has continued to breach his court-imposed gag order.\n\nMerchan has already hit the former president with a $9,000 fine for nine violations of the order, which is intended to stop Trump from intimidating witnesses, jurors, and others closely connected to the proceedings. Prosecutors on Thursday sought further penalties over another four alleged breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan has even threatened Trump with jail if the violations continue. The 2024 GOP presumptive nominee could face similar admonitions if a ruling on the latest alleged breaches does come this week.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hamill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Hamill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2741,w_4872,x_0,y_40/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1714988840/2024-05-05T211810Z_1490696182_MT1USATODAY23198459_RTRMADP_3_FORMULA-ONE-MIAMI-GRAND-PRIX_q1lij3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

He was fined $9,000 last week for nine violations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time, though he said that was \"the last thing I want to do.\"\n\nBefore heading into the courtroom Monday morning, Trump spoke to reporters, relaying familiar complaints about the fairness of the trial, the judge and the gag order that stops him commenting on witnesses and jurors, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe also noted the breaking news that Columbia University canceled its main commencement following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests.\n\n\"That shouldn't happen,\" he said.\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nThe indictment against Trump centers on payoffs allegedly made to two women, porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 and arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000.\n\nTrump's company, the Trump Organization, then reimbursed Cohen and paid him bonuses and extra payments - all of which, prosecutors say, were falsely logged as legal expenses in company records. Over several months, Cohen said the company paid him $420,000.\n\nPayments were also allegedly made to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged Trump had out of wedlock.\n\nThe indictment, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, made Trump the first ex-president ever to face criminal charges.\n\nTrump has denied the accusations.\n\nHicks took the stand last week, recounting how Trump's campaign was turned upside-down following the leak of a video wherein he bragged about grabbing women without their permission.\n\nMeanwhile, Davidson - who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations - also took the stand. Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nTrump also faced a second contempt hearing over whether he had again violated his gag order over four more prospective violations. Judge Juan M. Merchan has not yet ruled on that sanctions request.\n\nTrump was fined $9,000 earlier in the week over gag order violations.\n\nAfter being forced to release a seated juror, the judge ordered the media not to report on where potential jurors have worked - even when stated in open court - and to be careful about revealing information about those who would sit in judgment of the former president. Here's what we can report.\n\nJuror 1 and foreperson: A man who lives in New York City and has no children. Loves the outdoors and gets his news from The New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nWhen asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, \"I don't have an opinion.\"\n\nJuror 2: A man who said he follows Trump's former lawyer, Cohen, on \"X,\" formerly known as Twitter. He also revealed he follows other right-wing accounts including Trump's former adviser, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nHe has said he would unfollow Cohen as he may be a witness in the trial.\n\nJuror 3: A middle-aged man who lives in Manhattan. He grew up in Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times and Google.\n\nJuror 4: A man who lived in New York City for 15 years. He is originally from California. He is married with three children and a wife who is a teacher. He has served on a jury before - both on a grand jury and a jury in a criminal trial.\n\nThe juror said he gets his news from \"a smattering\" of sources and does not use social media.\n\nHe gets most of his news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and The Washington Post. The man has said he is aware there are other lawsuits but said, \"I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\"\n\nJuror 8: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 9: A woman who lives in Manhattan. She is not married and has no children.\n\nShe has never served on a jury before and does not watch the news. However, she said she does have email subscriptions to CNN and The New York Times. She follows social media accounts and listens to podcasts. She also enjoys watching reality TV.\n\nJuror 10: A man who lives in Manhattan. He is not married and has no children. He does have a roommate who works in accounting. He rarely follows the news but he does listen to podcasts on behavioral psychology.\n\nThe trial is expected to last anywhere from six to eight weeks. Trump is expected to attend court each day.\n\nThe trial is not being televised. Instead, news reporters and producers will have the ability to sit inside the courtroom and deliver information to the public.\n\nAs of this report, Trump is currently involved in four criminal cases, which includes the hush money case.\n\nA second case out of Fulton County, Georgia, has charged Trump, as well as 18 others, with participating in a scheme to illegally attempt to overturn the former president's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump is also involved in a third criminal case in Washington, D.C., which charged him with allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd his fourth case involves classified documents that Trump illegally retained at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House.\n\nRELATED: A guide to Trump's court cases", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [],

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nHere's some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA political hurricane ... and an actual one\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about groping women without their permission.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pantagraph.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@pantagraph.com", "name": "J.

Some took the stand for just a few hours, others spanned days. Some testified on their involvement in the 2016 deals to keep porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal from speaking out about their alleged affairs with Trump. (He denies the allegations).\n\nNew York courts typically do not allow for audio or visual recording in the courtroom. But due to \"unparalleled public interest\" in the case, officials decided to post transcripts and evidence online, providing insight into what the jury is seeing and hearing.\n\nHere are some key pieces of evidence the jury saw last week week in the first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history.\n\nMore from inside the courthouse:Freezing temps and colorful characters\n\nVideo of Trump at North Carolina rally\n\nWho introduced the evidence: Prosecution. As they set up in their opening arguments, prosecutors are trying to show Trump personally authorized the hush money payments to influence the election and covered up the payments in his business records.\n\nAssociated witness: Robert Browning, an executive director of C-SPAN's archives, and Hope Hicks, former Trump aide.\n\nTestimony: Prosecutors introduced the North Carolina rally excerpts along with two additional videos of Trump at rallies and a press conference. One, on October 22, 2016, showed Trump saying that women lied when they came forward, and the other complimented Cohen on being a good lawyer in his firm. Browning verified their origin. Hicks watched the video and confirmed that Trump was concerned that reports about his conduct with women could hurt his standing with voters.\n\nTranscript excerpt: \"I have no idea who these women are...now suddenly after many, many years, phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country,\" Trump said in Greensboro, North Carolina videos. \"These are all horrible lies, all fabrications, and we can't let them change the most important election in our lifetime. If 5% of the people think it's true, and maybe 10% think -- we don't, we don't win.\"\n\nSecretly recorded phone call between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump\n\nWho introduced the evidence: Prosecution. This recording was teased in the opening arguments, as they hope the jury will believe it demonstrates Cohen and Trump discussing hush money payments.\n\nAssociated witness: Computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus\n\nTestimony: Prosecutors appeared to suggest the \"David\" mentioned in the recording refers to David Pecker, former head of the National Enquirer's parent company, who already testified to his involvement in the hush money deals. On cross-examination and re-direct, Daus testified he hadn't found evidence of tampering but agreed with the defense that the jury must trust Cohen in some ways.\n\nTranscript excerpt: \"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David,\" Cohen said, and added he spoke to former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg about it. \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump asked.\n\nA transcript of the secretly recorded call was also submitted by the prosecution.\n\nSecretly recorded phone call between Cohen and Davidson\n\nWho introduced the evidence: Defense.\n\nAssociated witness: Keith Davidson, the lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in their hush money deals.\n\nTestimony: Trump layer Emil Bove questioned Davidson on previous deals he worked on that may have raised extortion concerns. He appeared to use the same line of questioning in regards to Stormy Daniels' deal, suggesting the 2016 election was used as leverage in the hush money deal.\n\nTranscript excerpt: \"Hypothetically speaking... sometimes people get settler's remorse,\" Davidson said on the call, which he testified was probably about Daniels. \"People think 'Hey, I need to settle this case the most before this date's certain because after that date, I have no more leverage.'\"\n\nDenial statement from Stormy Daniels\n\nFact check:Trump falsely presents Stormy Daniels letter as new in Truth Social post\n\nWho introduced the evidence: Prosecution.\n\nAssociated witness: Keith Davidson, the lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in their hush money deals.\n\nTestimony: Davidson said this denial and another statement issued weeks earlier to The Wall Street Journal were both \"technically\" true when you hone in on the meaning of each word. In the statement, Daniels denied \"an alleged sexual relationship\" with Trump. Davidson didn't believe anyone alleged there was a \"relationship\" between Daniels and Trump, he said on the stand.\n\n\"I think it's technically true,\" Davidson testified, saying earlier that you have to go through a denial like this \"word-by-word.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kinsey_crowley@azcentral.com", "name":

Trump to resume Monday after eventful third week of testimony, thousands of dollars of gag order fines", "body": "Fox News legal editor Kerri Kupec Urbahn and contributor Andy McCarthy join 'Your World' to discuss the latest in New York v. Trump following Hope Hicks' testimony.\n\nFormer President Trump's criminal trial will resume Monday after an eventful third week that saw key witnesses testify and thousands of dollars in fines against the presumptive Republican nominee -- with the possibility of additional fines looming.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges stem from a years-long investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\n\nThe charges are related to alleged payments made to silence adult film actress Stormy Daniels about an alleged extramarital affair with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nHOPE HICKS: COHEN CALLED HIMSELF 'MR. FIX IT' ONLY BECAUSE HE 'BROKE IT'\n\nDA Alvin Bragg must convince the jury that not only did Trump falsify the business records related to hush money payments, but that he did so in furtherance of another crime, conspiracy to promote or prevent election.\n\nOn their own, falsifying business records and conspiracy to promote or prevent election are misdemeanor charges.\n\nProsecutors, during the third week of the trial, called a number of witnesses to testify, including Keith Davidson, an attorney who once represented Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nDavidson said Daniels' denial of an affair with Trump was technically true. He also testified that the money ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid her was not a payoff, but a \"consideration.\"\n\nTrump's defense attorneys, during cross-examination, played audio recordings of Davidson, in which he can be heard admitting Cohen did not need authority from Trump to make the payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: WITNESS SAYS COHEN DREAMED OF WHITE HOUSE JOB DESPITE DENYING AMBITIONS IN HOUSE TESTIMONY\n\nBefore Davidson, the jury heard testimony from Doug Daus, a computer forensic analyst for the DA's office, who testified about examining two cellphones that belonged to Cohen.\n\nDuring Daus' testimony, an audio recording was played.\n\n\"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,\" Cohen said during the call. \"So, I'm gonna do that right away. I've actually come up and spoken to Allen Weisselberg. ... I'm all over that. I've spoken to Allen about it, when it comes time for the financing, which will be -- \"\n\nTrump replied: \"Listen, what financing?\"\n\nHUSH MONEY TRIAL JUDGE DOUBLES DOWN ON NOT SHOWING TRUMP 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE TO JURORS\n\nLast week, the jury heard testimony from bank executive Gary Farro, who said he assisted Cohen in setting up an account for Essential Consultants, LLC, the shell company Bragg alleges Cohen used to make the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nBut Farro testified that there was nothing to indicate that the account would be used to make a payment on behalf of a political candidate, to purchase a media story or to pay an adult film actress. Farro testified that had the account been intended for those matters, there would have been additional scrutiny and delays in opening it, and he admitted it was possible the account would never have been opened.\n\nFarro also testified he was unaware the account was being done on behalf of Trump.\n\nThe week ended with testimony from Hope Hicks, who worked for the Trump Organization and later served as Trump's press secretary during the 2016 presidential campaign. Hicks later served as White House director of strategic communications.\n\n\"He knew what he wanted to say and how to say it, and we were all just following his lead,\" Hicks said of Trump. \"He deserves the credit for the agenda.\"\n\nTRUMP DELIVERS PIZZA TO NEW YORK CITY FIREFIGHTERS IN CAMPAIGN STOP AFTER DAY IN COURT\n\nHicks was asked about the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape featuring controversial comments from Trump that came out in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election.\n\nHicks said she was \"a little stunned\" when she saw the tape and said it was a \"damaging development\" to the campaign, adding it \"obviously wasn't helpful.\" But she noted it was two guys talking privately and insisted it was locker room talk that wasn't meant to upset anyone.\n\nThe 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape came to light ahead of the 2016 election and showed Trump boasting to host Billy Bush that he could kiss and grope women due to his star power.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan previously prohibited the prosecution from showing the tape to jurors, saying in March, \"It is not necessary that the tape itself be introduced into evidence or that it be played for the jury.\"\n\nHicks also said Trump told her the claims of him having an affair with former Playboy model Karen McDougal were \"unequivocally untrue.\"\n\nHicks also blasted Michael Cohen, saying he was not involved in the 2016 campaign but would try to insert himself at certain moments. Hicks said the campaign had its own lawyers, and Cohen was instructed to focus on Trump's private business credentials.\n\nNY V TRUMP: REMAINING ALLEGED GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS HANG IN BALANCE AS TRIAL RESUMES\n\nHicks said Cohen \"used to like to call himself Mr. Fix it, but it was only because he first broke it.\"\n\nHicks also testified that, with regard to allegations about Stormy Daniels, Trump did not want \"anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed about anything on the campaign.\"\n\n\"He wanted them to be proud of him,\" she said.\n\nTrump was fined $9,000 for violating a trial gag order imposed upon him. Judge Merchan still needs to consider four additional alleged violations of the order, which could come this week.\n\nThe former president has blasted the trial as rigged and in coordination with President Biden's White House. Trump says the case, and others against him, are \"election interference.\"\n\nAs for the gag order, Trump calls it \"unconstitutional\" and said he will appeal the order altogether, arguing it is a violation of his First Amendment rights. Trump has called on the judge to recuse himself, saying he is \"totally conflicted.\"\n\nThe former president has said Democrats want to keep him confined to the courtroom and off of the campaign trail.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCourt does not meet on Wednesdays. Trump has taken advantage of that arrangement and last week held rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nAfter hours in court last Thursday, Trump delivered pizzas to FDNY firefighters at a midtown

Hicks also testified that Trump's electoral standing with women was a concern for the campaign at the time Michael Cohen paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. Trump denies Daniels' claim that they had sex in 2006.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nHicks' emotional breakdown Friday happened soon after Trump lawyer Emil Bove began to ask her introductory questions. It wasn't clear what caused her emotions. It could have been facing questioning by the lawyer for her former boss, who could be imprisoned if convicted. It could also have been that something in the prosecution's earlier questions and her responses was sinking in.\n\nJust before Bove started his cross-examination, Hicks said in response to a prosecutor's question that Trump has asked her how a post-2016 election story about Michael Cohen's payment to Stormy Daniels \"was playing.\"\n\n\"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" Hicks said.\n\nThat is significant testimony for the prosecution, which is arguing that Trump committed felonies when he allegedly falsified business records because the purpose of the falsification was to cover up violating campaign finance laws through the $130,000 hush money payment.

The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nThe indictment against Trump centers on payoffs allegedly made to two women, porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 and arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000.\n\nTrump's company, the Trump Organization, then reimbursed Cohen and paid him bonuses and extra payments - all of which, prosecutors say, were falsely logged as legal expenses in company records. Over several months, Cohen said the company paid him $420,000.\n\nPayments were also allegedly made to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged Trump had out of wedlock.\n\nThe indictment, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, made Trump the first ex-president ever to face criminal charges.\n\nTrump has denied the accusations.\n\nHicks took the stand last week, recounting how Trump's campaign was turned upside-down following the leak of a video wherein he bragged about grabbing women without their permission.\n\nMeanwhile, Davidson - who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations - also took the stand. Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nTrump also faced a second contempt hearing over whether he had again violated his gag order over four more prospective violations. Judge Juan M. Merchan has not yet ruled on that sanctions request.\n\nTrump was fined $9,000 earlier in the week over gag order violations.\n\nAfter being forced to release a seated juror, the judge ordered the media not to report on where potential jurors have worked - even when stated in open court - and to be careful about revealing information about those who would sit in judgment of the former president. Here's what we can report.\n\nJuror 1 and foreperson: A man who lives in New York City and has no children. Loves the outdoors and gets his news from The New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nWhen asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, \"I don't have an opinion.\"\n\nJuror 2: A man who said he follows Trump's former lawyer, Cohen, on \"X,\" formerly known as Twitter. He also revealed he follows other right-wing accounts including Trump's former adviser, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nHe has said he would unfollow Cohen as he may be a witness in the trial.\n\nJuror 3: A middle-aged man who lives in Manhattan. He grew up in Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times and Google.\n\nJuror 4: A man who lived in New York City for 15 years. He is originally from California. He is married with three children and a wife who is a teacher. He has served on a jury before - both on a grand jury and a jury in a criminal trial.\n\nThe juror said he gets his news from \"a smattering\" of sources and does not use social media.\n\nHe gets most of his news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and The Washington Post. The man has said he is aware there are other lawsuits but said, \"I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\"\n\nJuror 8: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 9: A woman who lives in Manhattan. She is not married and has no children.\n\nShe has never served on a jury before and does not watch the news. However, she said she does have email subscriptions to CNN and The New York Times. She follows social media accounts and listens to podcasts. She also enjoys watching reality TV.\n\nJuror 10: A man who lives in Manhattan. He is not married and has no children. He does have a roommate who works in accounting. He rarely follows the news but he does listen to podcasts on behavioral psychology.\n\nThe trial is expected to last anywhere from six to eight weeks. Trump is expected to attend court each day.\n\nThe trial is not being televised. Instead, news reporters and producers will have the ability to sit inside the courtroom and deliver information to the public.\n\nAs of this report, Trump is currently involved in four criminal cases, which includes the hush money case.\n\nA second case out of Fulton County, Georgia, has charged Trump, as well as 18 others, with participating in a scheme to illegally attempt to overturn the former president's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump is also involved in a third criminal case in Washington, D.C., which charged him with allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd his fourth case involves classified documents that Trump illegally retained at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House.\n\nRELATED: A guide to Trump's court cases", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35 Orlando"}, "authors":

Trump to resume Monday after eventful third week of testimony, thousands of dollars of gag order fines", "body": "Former President Trump's criminal trial will resume Monday after an eventful third week that saw key witnesses testify and thousands of dollars in fines against the presumptive Republican nominee -- with the possibility of additional fines looming.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges stem from a years-long investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\n\nThe charges are related to alleged payments made to silence adult film actress Stormy Daniels about an alleged extramarital affair with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nHOPE HICKS: COHEN CALLED HIMSELF 'MR. FIX IT' ONLY BECAUSE HE 'BROKE IT'\n\nDA Alvin Bragg must convince the jury that not only did Trump falsify the business records related to hush money payments, but that he did so in furtherance of another crime, conspiracy to promote or prevent election.\n\nOn their own, falsifying business records and conspiracy to promote or prevent election are misdemeanor charges.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nProsecutors, during the third week of the trial, called a number of witnesses to testify, including Keith Davidson, an attorney who once represented Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nDavidson said Daniels' denial of an affair with Trump was technically true. He also testified that the money ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid her was not a payoff, but a \"consideration.\"\n\nTrump's defense attorneys, during cross-examination, played audio recordings of Davidson, in which he can be heard admitting Cohen did not need authority from Trump to make the payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: WITNESS SAYS COHEN DREAMED OF WHITE HOUSE JOB DESPITE DENYING AMBITIONS IN HOUSE TESTIMONY\n\nBefore Davidson, the jury heard testimony from Doug Daus, a computer forensic analyst for the DA's office, who testified about examining two cellphones that belonged to Cohen.\n\nDuring Daus' testimony, an audio recording was played.\n\n\"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,\" Cohen said during the call. \"So, I'm gonna do that right away. I've actually come up and spoken to Allen Weisselberg. ... I'm all over that. I've spoken to Allen about it, when it comes time for the financing, which will be -- \"\n\nTrump replied: \"Listen, what financing?\"\n\nHUSH MONEY TRIAL JUDGE DOUBLES DOWN ON NOT SHOWING TRUMP 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE TO JURORS\n\nLast week, the jury heard testimony from bank executive Gary Farro, who said he assisted Cohen in setting up an account for Essential Consultants, LLC, the shell company Bragg alleges Cohen used to make the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nBut Farro testified that there was nothing to indicate that the account would be used to make a payment on behalf of a political candidate, to purchase a media story or to pay an adult film actress. Farro testified that had the account been intended for those matters, there would have been additional scrutiny and delays in opening it, and he admitted it was possible the account would never have been opened.\n\nFarro also testified he was unaware the account was being done on behalf of Trump.\n\nThe week ended with testimony from Hope Hicks, who worked for the Trump Organization and later served as Trump's press secretary during the 2016 presidential campaign. Hicks later served as White House director of strategic communications.\n\n\"He knew what he wanted to say and how to say it, and we were all just following his lead,\" Hicks said of Trump. \"He deserves the credit for the agenda.\"\n\nTRUMP DELIVERS PIZZA TO NEW YORK CITY FIREFIGHTERS IN CAMPAIGN STOP AFTER DAY IN COURT\n\nHicks was asked about the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape featuring controversial comments from Trump that came out in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election.\n\nHicks said she was \"a little stunned\" when she saw the tape and said it was a \"damaging development\" to the campaign, adding it \"obviously wasn't helpful.\" But she noted it was two guys talking privately and insisted it was locker room talk that wasn't meant to upset anyone.\n\nThe 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape came to light ahead of the 2016 election and showed Trump boasting to host Billy Bush that he could kiss and grope women due to his star power.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan previously prohibited the prosecution from showing the tape to jurors, saying in March, \"It is not necessary that the tape itself be introduced into evidence or that it be played for the jury.\"\n\nHicks also said Trump told her the claims of him having an affair with former Playboy model Karen McDougal were \"unequivocally untrue.\"\n\nHicks also blasted Michael Cohen, saying he was not involved in the 2016 campaign but would try to insert himself at certain moments. Hicks said the campaign had its own lawyers, and Cohen was instructed to focus on Trump's private business credentials.\n\nNY V TRUMP: REMAINING ALLEGED GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS HANG IN BALANCE AS TRIAL RESUMES\n\nHicks said Cohen \"used to like to call himself Mr. Fix it, but it was only because he first broke it.\"\n\nHicks also testified that, with regard to allegations about Stormy Daniels, Trump did not want \"anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed about anything on the campaign.\"\n\n\"He wanted them to be proud of him,\" she said.\n\nTrump was fined $9,000 for violating a trial gag order imposed upon him. Judge Merchan still needs to consider four additional alleged violations of the order, which could come this week.\n\nThe former president has blasted the trial as rigged and in coordination with President Biden's White House. Trump says the case, and others against him, are \"election interference.\"\n\nAs for the gag order, Trump calls it \"unconstitutional\" and said he will appeal the order altogether, arguing it is a violation of his First Amendment rights. Trump has called on the judge to recuse himself, saying he is \"totally conflicted.\"\n\nThe former president has said Democrats want to keep him confined to the courtroom and off of the campaign trail.\n\nCourt does not meet on Wednesdays. Trump has taken advantage of that arrangement and last week held rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nAfter hours in court last Thursday, Trump delivered pizzas to FDNY firefighters at a midtown Manhattan firehouse to honor first responders.\n\nFox News' Maria Paronich and Brianna Herlihy contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

The prosecutor's office kept the information secret, telling New York State Judge Juan Merchan that it was concerned that Trump might post witness information on social media.\n\nMercan found Trump guilty of criminal contempt last week for violating a gag order barring him from making \"public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses regarding their potential participation in the investigation or this criminal proceeding.\" The violations included posts about two likely witnesses, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and adult film star Stormy Daniels, both of whom are central to the prosecutor's case.\n\nMerchan fined Trump $9,000, which he paid on Thursday, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said.\n\nLast week, dramatic testimony from Hope Hicks, a former top Trump adviser, and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented Daniels and Karen McDougal, women who say they had sex with the married Trump in 2006, was presented last week. Trump has denied their claims. Both received six-figure payments to keep silent about their claims during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMcDougal, a former Playboy model, received $150,000 through National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, and Cohen paid Daniels $130,000. Trump ultimately repaid Cohen through payments that the prosecutor said were falsely labeled as legal fees. He has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nHicks, a former longtime Trump aide, broke down in tears as she answered a question about her first job for Trump's company in 2014. She testified that Trump told her he was not at aware of Cohen's payment because he had kept it for himself. himself. She indicated that she was skeptical of this claim.\n\nI didn't know Michael as a particularly charitable or altruistic person. She's a credit-seeking kind of person, she said. Under cross-examination, she also said he often tried to insert himself into the campaign, which annoyed campaign staffers. He liked to call himself a repairman or Mr. Fixer, and it was only because he broke it first that he was able to come and fix it,\" she said.\n\nDavidson testified about his dealings with Pecker and Cohen, who he said complained to him in December 2016 that Trump had not yet repaid him for the secret payment.\n\nDavidson, who was largely monotonous for most of his two days of testimony, got into heated exchanges with Trump lawyer Emil Bove, who pressed him about his clients in other salacious tabloids in who he had been involved with over the years, including an alleged person. for leaking information about actor Lindsay Lohan's stay in rehab, clients peddling sex tapes featuring wrestler Hulk Hogan and influencer Tila Tequila, and various allegations involving actor Charlie Sheen.\n\nDavidson was evasive in his responses to Bove, saying he didn't remember the details. I've had more than 1,500 clients in my career, he said.\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement that Trump, Cohen and Pecker conspired to influence the 2016 election and that Trump \"covered up this criminal conspiracy by lying over and over again in his New York business records.\" .\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said in his opening statement that nondisclosure agreements are legal and that there was nothing criminal about Trump's payments to Cohen. As for the conspiracy allegations, Blanche said, I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nOutside the jury's presence, Trump was fined for running afoul of a judge's gag order. Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA look at some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA POLITICAL HURRICANE ... AND AN ACTUAL ONE\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nHicks acknowledged being \"concerned, very concerned\" when a reporter reached out to her for comment before breaking the story.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nIn fact, in the aftermath of the tape's release, Hicks said she asked Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer and personal fixer, to hunt down a rumor of another potentially damaging recording. \"There was no such tape regardless,\" Hicks said, \"but he sort of chased that down for me.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTRUMP THE EXTORTION TARGET?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\n'WHAT DO WE GOT TO PAY FOR THIS?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTHE 'JERK'\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011 when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who have been \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they could also help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTO JAIL A PRESIDENT\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly has maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded, but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nTrump also faced a second contempt hearing over whether he had again violated his gag order over four more prospective violations. Judge Juan M. Merchan has not yet ruled on that sanctions request. Trump was fined $9,000 last Tuesday over nine gag order violations.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: Terms to know in Trump trial\n\n-- What Trump's gag order means in his hush money case\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases.

And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nFormer White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks on Friday painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nTHE WITNESS HEARD, BUT NOT YET SEEN\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nTRUMP EXPECTED IN COURT AS TRIAL ENTERS 12TH DAY\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case. A second contempt hearing was held on Thursday over four more prospective violations, but Merchan did not immediately issue a decision.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

McConney said former Trump chief financial officer Allan Weisselberg told him the payments should be \"grossed up\" to help cover Cohen's state, federal and city taxes, NBC News reported.\n\nIn Trump counsel Todd Blanche's opening statements, he acknowledged Daniels signed an NDA in October 2016 in exchange for $130,000.\n\nBut, he told jurors: \"you're going to learn this was not a payback. The $35,000 a month was not a payback to Mr. Cohen for the money that he gave to Ms. Daniels.\"\n\nThat statement conflicts with Trump's filings in a 2020 California case, where filings submitted by his lawyers said defendant Trump \"admitted that Defendant reimbursed EC for EC's $130,000 payment to Plaintiff, which was in consideration for Plaintiff's promises not to disclose confidential information pertaining to\" Trump's then-alias David Dennison.\n\nStill, former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said those statements alone cannot be used against Trump in the trial.\n\n\"Unless they were verified pleadings, or like a declaration, they are not something that can be used against Trump,\" Rahmani said. \"Just because his lawyers are making inconsistent arguments is not something that can be used against Trump.\"\n\nIn August 2018, Trump himself said Cohen's payments to women did not come from the campaign.\n\n\"They weren't taken out of campaign finance, that's the big thing,\" Trump said in an interview in a \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"That's a much bigger thing. Did they come out of the campaign? They didn't come out of the campaign; they came from me.\"\n\nAnd in notable testimony on Monday, McConney also testified that the bulk of the payback came from Trump's own bank account, according to The New York Times.\n\nRahmani said that leaves Trump's lawyers with their main argument: \"I think what they're going to say is: Trump had nothing to do with them. Someone else created the records.\"\n\n\"One important takeaway from the defendant's opening is, they're going to blame the accountant,\" Rahman said. \"The accountant is going to be the fall guy. I think they're going to say that Trump had no involvement in booking these payments to Cohen as legal expenses, that that was something the accountant did.\"\n\nTrump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, with prosecutors saying he was part of a scheme to kill damaging stories about extramarital affairs ahead of his 2016 campaign.\n\nProsecutors are elevating the falsification of business records charges to felonies because they allege Trump caused the falsification to conceal an underlying crime - Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged that Trump tried to \"conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\" New York's election conspiracy statute says it's a misdemeanor to \"conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\"\n\nTrump denies those charges, as well as the affairs. Each count is punishable by up to four years behind bars.\n\nIn a key piece of evidence played for jurors last week, a Sept. 6, 2016 audio recording includes Trump and Cohen apparently talking about making a $150,000 payment to model Karen McDougal, who claims she and Trump had a ten-month affair after he married Melania Trump.\n\n\"'I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David,'\" Cohen said, apparently referring to National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.\n\nIn the recording, Trump says: \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\"\n\n\"For me, that's the most compelling evidence of all - it's on tape, and it's clear that he's involved in this scheme,\" said Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego who has served as a legal advisor for the Republican Accountability Project, said Trump's team have done a \"pretty good job\" to build reasonable doubt among jurors with the case in front of them.\n\nBut Truax said he himself is surprised by the \"strength\" of the prosecution's case.\n\nAnd he said though he believes the recording is a key piece of direct evidence, he thinks jurors will ultimately be swayed more by the bulk of the circumstantial evidence.\n\n\"Does it makes sense that the people working for Donald Trump decided to go out and organize this catch and kill deal for these two women, and especially of course for Stormy Daniels, which is the charges at issue, organize this catch and kill system, paid a lot of money, and then just keep it quiet because we don't want to bother Donald Trump with this? 'We paid $130,000. But let's not distress him,'\" Truax said. \"It doesn't make any sense that they wouldn't have at least gone to see him and say: 'There's this allegation against you. Is it true and what should we do about it?' But they decided not to involve Donald Trump, who was a famous micromanager in any of this discussion, and simply do it on their own out of the goodness of their heart?\"\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nOther prosecution key witnesses so far include former Trump aide Hope Hicks, who Rahmani said didn't have a \"smoking gun\" but testified to corroborate Trump's involvement in day-to-day campaign matters.\n\n\"She was able to connect the dots between Cohen and Trump,\" Rahman said.\n\nHicks also said that Trump was worried about his wife's reaction to reports of affairs following release of the Access Hollywood recording - a key argument posed by the defense.\n\nTruax said that statement alone doesn't sink the prosecution's case. \"Something that the prosecution will probably raise is that people very rarely do things with only one idea in their mind,\" he said.\n\n\"To me, it's quite clear that he was deeply concerned about his political campaign, and that was the reason why he was pushing this so hard,\" Truax added.\n\nKeith Davidson, a former lawyer for both Daniels and McDougal, testified about the agreement to pay off Daniels, as well as his knowledge of Cohen's role and Cohen's frustration while awaiting reimbursement from Trump.\n\nPecker, meanwhile, in his testimony set the scene for the catch-and-kill scheme and the National Enquirer's role in killing negative stories about Trump and instead running positive ones.\n\nTrump was also hit with another $1,000 fine for violating his gag order, which in part prohibits him from talking about jurors.\n\nThe judge has warned him that another violation could land him behind bars.\n\nTrump has continued to portray himself as a victim of a vast witch hunt and complained that the courts and prosecutors are persecuting him.\n\n\"I don't know if Trump will ever conform his behavior,\" Rahmani said. \"Nothing leads me to believe his is willing to comply with his gag orders.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person",

Hicks also testified that Trump's electoral standing with women was a concern for the campaign at the time Michael Cohen paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. Trump denies Daniels' claim that they had sex in 2006.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump Media auditor fined $12 million for 'massive fraud': SEC\n\nThe accountants for Donald Trump's media company Truth Social were charged with \"massive fraud\" and fined millions of dollars, but Trump's company wasn't charged with wrongdoing, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.\n\nBF Borgers and its owner, Benjamin Borgers, were charged with fraud that affected 1,500 SEC filings, including those of Trump Media, the SEC said. The company agreed to pay a $12 million civil penalty and Borgers agreed to pay $2 million, and both agreed to stop auditing.\n\nBorgers didn't properly prepare or maintain audit documentation, fabricated audit planning meetings and sometimes passed off previous audits for current ones, the SEC said.\n\n\"Trump Media looks forward to working with new auditing partners,\" the company announced in a statement.\n\nHicks' emotional breakdown Friday happened soon after Trump lawyer Emil Bove began to ask her introductory questions. It wasn't clear what caused her emotions. It could have been facing questioning by the lawyer for her former boss, who could be imprisoned if convicted. It could also have been that something in the prosecution's earlier questions and her responses was sinking in.\n\nJust before Bove started his cross-examination, Hicks said in response to a prosecutor's question that Trump has asked her how a post-2016 election story about Michael Cohen's payment to Stormy Daniels \"was playing.\"\n\n\"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" Hicks said.\n\nThat is significant testimony for the prosecution, which is arguing that Trump committed felonies when he allegedly falsified business records because the purpose of the falsification was to cover up violating campaign finance laws through the $130,000 hush money payment. Trump may argue the payment wasn't about the election at all, but was instead designed to shield his family from an embarrassing story.\n\nTrump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors allege he was covering up unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through a $130,000 hush money payment from his then-lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to porn star Stormy Daniels.

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "journalstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JournalStar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@journalstar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@journalstar.com", "name": "J.

Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels.\n\nThe trial has gripped the legal and political establishment as Trump seeks to re-take the White House from President Joe Biden in November's election.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden.\n\nHe also faces charges of illegally storing huge quantities of top-secret documents taken from the White House after his presidency to his home in Florida.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.com/c82d78d5d3054dccfe44630752ced8bc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial Tags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

(Steven Hirsch-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAs the third week of testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan begins, prosecutors are launching into the financial nitty gritty of the catch-and-kill scheme that quashed salacious stories about the then-presidential candidate as the 2016 election approached.\n\nOne key issue is whether the $420,000 that Trump paid to his former fixer and attorney Michael Cohen was to pay Cohen back for paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels to the tune of $130,000.\n\nOn Monday, former Trump Organization controller Jeff McConney testified that he was told Trump was reimbursing Cohen for an unknown reason. McConney said former Trump chief financial officer Allan Weisselberg told him the payments should be \"grossed up\" to help cover Cohen's state, federal and city taxes, NBC News reported.\n\nIn Trump counsel Todd Blanche's opening statements, he acknowledged Daniels signed an NDA in October 2016 in exchange for $130,000.\n\nBut, he told jurors: \"you're going to learn this was not a payback. The $35,000 a month was not a payback to Mr. Cohen for the money that he gave to Ms. Daniels.\"\n\nThat statement conflicts with Trump's filings in a 2020 California case, where filings submitted by his lawyers said defendant Trump \"admitted that Defendant reimbursed EC for EC's $130,000 payment to Plaintiff, which was in consideration for Plaintiff's promises not to disclose confidential information pertaining to\" Trump's then-alias David Dennison.\n\nStill, former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said those statements alone cannot be used against Trump in the trial.\n\n\"Unless they were verified pleadings, or like a declaration, they are not something that can be used against Trump,\" Rahmani said. \"Just because his lawyers are making inconsistent arguments is not something that can be used against Trump.\"\n\nIn August 2018, Trump himself said Cohen's payments to women did not come from the campaign.\n\n\"They weren't taken out of campaign finance, that's the big thing,\" Trump said in an interview in a \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"That's a much bigger thing. Did they come out of the campaign? They didn't come out of the campaign; they came from me.\"\n\nAnd in notable testimony on Monday, McConney also testified that the bulk of the payback came from Trump's own bank account, according to The New York Times.\n\nRahmani said that leaves Trump's lawyers with their main argument: \"I think what they're going to say is: Trump had nothing to do with them. Someone else created the records.\"\n\n\"One important takeaway from the defendant's opening is, they're going to blame the accountant,\" Rahman said. \"The accountant is going to be the fall guy. I think they're going to say that Trump had no involvement in booking these payments to Cohen as legal expenses, that that was something the accountant did.\"\n\nTrump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, with prosecutors saying he was part of a scheme to kill damaging stories about extramarital affairs ahead of his 2016 campaign.\n\nProsecutors are elevating the falsification of business records charges to felonies because they allege Trump caused the falsification to conceal an underlying crime - Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged that Trump tried to \"conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\" New York's election conspiracy statute says it's a misdemeanor to \"conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\"\n\nTrump denies those charges, as well as the affairs. Each count is punishable by up to four years behind bars.\n\nIn a key piece of evidence played for jurors last week, a Sept. 6, 2016 audio recording includes Trump and Cohen apparently talking about making a $150,000 payment to model Karen McDougal, who claims she and Trump had a ten-month affair after he married Melania Trump.\n\n\"'I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David,'\" Cohen said, apparently referring to National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.\n\nIn the recording, Trump says: \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\"\n\n\"For me, that's the most compelling evidence of all - it's on tape, and it's clear that he's involved in this scheme,\" said Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego who has served as a legal advisor for the Republican Accountability Project, said Trump's team have done a \"pretty good job\" to build reasonable doubt among jurors with the case in front of them.\n\nBut Truax said he himself is surprised by the \"strength\" of the prosecution's case.\n\nAnd he said though he believes the recording is a key piece of direct evidence, he thinks jurors will ultimately be swayed more by the bulk of the circumstantial evidence.\n\n\"Does it makes sense that the people working for Donald Trump decided to go out and organize this catch and kill deal for these two women, and especially of course for Stormy Daniels, which is the charges at issue, organize this catch and kill system, paid a lot of money, and then just keep it quiet because we don't want to bother Donald Trump with this? 'We paid $130,000. But let's not distress him,'\" Truax said. \"It doesn't make any sense that they wouldn't have at least gone to see him and say: 'There's this allegation against you. Is it true and what should we do about it?' But they decided not to involve Donald Trump, who was a famous micromanager in any of this discussion, and simply do it on their own out of the goodness of their heart?\"\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nOther prosecution key witnesses so far include former Trump aide Hope Hicks, who Rahmani said didn't have a \"smoking gun\" but testified to corroborate Trump's involvement in day-to-day campaign matters.\n\n\"She was able to connect the dots between Cohen and Trump,\" Rahman said.\n\nHicks also said that Trump was worried about his wife's reaction to reports of affairs following release of the Access Hollywood recording - a key argument posed by the defense.\n\nTruax said that statement alone doesn't sink the prosecution's case. \"Something that the prosecution will probably raise is that people very rarely do things with only one idea in their mind,\" he said.\n\n\"To me, it's quite clear that he was deeply concerned about his political campaign, and that was the reason why he was pushing this so hard,\" Truax added.\n\nKeith Davidson, a former lawyer for both Daniels and McDougal, testified about the agreement to pay off Daniels, as well as his knowledge of Cohen's role and Cohen's frustration while awaiting reimbursement from Trump.\n\nPecker, meanwhile, in his testimony set the scene for the catch-and-kill scheme and the National Enquirer's role in killing negative stories about Trump and instead running positive ones.\n\nTrump was also hit with another $1,000 fine for violating his gag order, which in part prohibits him from talking about jurors.\n\nThe judge has warned him that another violation could land him behind bars.\n\nTrump has continued to portray himself as a victim of a vast witch hunt and complained that the courts and prosecutors are persecuting him.\n\n\"I don't know if Trump will ever conform his behavior,\" Rahmani said. \"Nothing leads me to believe his is willing to comply with his gag orders.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person",

So when she's up there and crying, it's really tough on the Trump team and it's much different than [Michael] Cohen who has an axe to grind, who will be coming up.\"\n\nThe defense team's argument is that Cohen is a disgruntled former employee out to smear a boss who never gave him a plum White House gig. It was Cohen, the argument goes, that took it upon himself to pay $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for the right to bury her story: that she slept with a married Trump just a few months after his wife, Melania, gave birth.\n\nBut prosecutors say not only was Trump aware of the payment - they've introduced a recording of him discussing it with Cohen - but of the plot to cover it up by falsifying business records. Cohen himself was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in the alleged scheme, in which the cost of buying Daniels' silence was listed as \"legal expenses\" in Trump Organization paperwork; if the intent was to help Trump's presidential campaign, the payment should have been reported as a campaign expense and made public knowledge, prosecutors say.\n\nIn her testimony Friday, Hicks described a Trump campaign in \"crisis,\" rocked by the October 2016 release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which the candidate boasts of sexual assault, and a general feeling that it might not survive another scandal before the November election. It was after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, and before voters headed to the polls, that the decision was made to pay off Daniels.\n\nHicks said she was first made aware of that payment in 2018, after the Wall Street Journal reported on the existence of an agreement with Daniels. At the time, she testified, the president told her that \"Michael [Cohen] had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him and that's what he was doing and he did it out of the kindness of his heart.\"\n\nBut that doesn't sound like Michael Cohen, Hicks admitted under questioning. \"I'd say that would be out of character for Michael,\" she said, adding: \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person.\" (David Pecker, former publisher of the National Enquirer, earlier testified that he had entered into a \"catch-and-kill\" arrangement with Trump and Cohen to buy up potentially damaging stories.)\n\nHicks' testimony did help Trump's defense in one sense: she said Trump was indeed concerned about his wife, Melania, learning about another allegation that he cheated on her with Playboy model Karen McDougal But she also made clear that was not his stated concern in 2018, when Daniels' claim went public; then, she testified, Trump told her it was being talked about now because \"it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nCNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said that Hicks' testimony, speaking to Trump's own political concerns, will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain the argument that he acted only to spare his wife from learning about affairs that he denies ever having.\n\n\"As a matter of law, if the prosecution can show that Trump had a mixed motive - but he would not have made these payments but for the campaign - legally, the judge is going to instruct the jury that's enough to establish the intent to commit a crime,\" Eisen said.\n\nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who worked for special counsel Robert Mueller, argued that Hicks' testimony was more than just damaging to Trump's defense; he said it could be game over.\n\n\"You can really see the end of this coming up fast and furious with the [district attorney] just closing it out on the actual reimbursement scheme, which is something that cannot really be denied credibly by Donald Trump's team,\" Weissmann said on MSNBC.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hicks watched the video and confirmed that Trump was concerned that reports about his conduct with women could hurt his standing with voters.\n\nTranscript excerpt: \"I have no idea who these women are...now suddenly after many, many years, phony accusers come out less than a month before one of the most important elections in the history of our country,\" Trump said in Greensboro, North Carolina videos. \"These are all horrible lies, all fabrications, and we can't let them change the most important election in our lifetime. If 5% of the people think it's true, and maybe 10% think -- we don't, we don't win.\"\n\nWho introduced the evidence: Prosecution. This recording was teased in the opening arguments, as they hope the jury will believe it demonstrates Cohen and Trump discussing hush money payments.\n\nAssociated witness: Computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus\n\nTestimony: Prosecutors appeared to suggest the \"David\" mentioned in the recording refers to David Pecker, former head of the National Enquirer's parent company, who already testified to his involvement in the hush money deals. On cross-examination and re-direct, Daus testified he hadn't found evidence of tampering but agreed with the defense that the jury must trust Cohen in some ways.\n\nTranscript excerpt: \"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David,\" Cohen said, and added he spoke to former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg about it. \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump asked.\n\nA transcript of the secretly recorded call was also submitted by the prosecution.\n\nWho introduced the evidence: Defense.\n\nAssociated witness: Keith Davidson, the lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in their hush money deals.\n\nTestimony: Trump layer Emil Bove questioned Davidson on previous deals he worked on that may have raised extortion concerns. He appeared to use the same line of questioning in regards to Stormy Daniels' deal, suggesting the 2016 election was used as leverage in the hush money deal.\n\nTranscript excerpt: \"Hypothetically speaking... sometimes people get settler's remorse,\" Davidson said on the call, which he testified was probably about Daniels. \"People think 'Hey, I need to settle this case the most before this date's certain because after that date, I have no more leverage.'\"\n\nFact check: Trump falsely presents Stormy Daniels letter as new in Truth Social post\n\nWho introduced the evidence: Prosecution.\n\nAssociated witness: Keith Davidson, the lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in their hush money deals.\n\nTestimony: Davidson said this denial and another statement issued weeks earlier to The Wall Street Journal were both \"technically\" true when you hone in on the meaning of each word. In the statement, Daniels denied \"an alleged sexual relationship\" with Trump. Davidson didn't believe anyone alleged there was a \"relationship\" between Daniels and Trump, he said on the stand.\n\n\"I think it's technically true,\" Davidson testified, saying earlier that you have to go through a denial like this \"word-by-word.\"\n\nContributing: Aysha Bagchi", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C-SPAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-22", "textStart": 1699, "textEnd": 1715}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

There is Michael Cohen, the Trump fixer who made that payment and is expected to be crucial for the prosecution. And there are several employees of the Trump family business, who helped the then-president reimburse Cohen.\n\nTrump, the first American president to face criminal prosecution, is charged with 34 felonies related to those reimbursements: The Manhattan district attorney's office says that he coordinated the falsification of documents related to the repayment.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nThe exact order of witnesses is unclear, but the trial is zipping along and the prosecution could wrap up in little more than two weeks. Daniels could testify as soon as this week, bringing her face to face with Trump, who for years has attacked her.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and has denied that he had sex with Daniels. If convicted, he could face probation or as long as four years in prison. He will not testify as part of the prosecution's case; it is unclear whether he will later take the stand in his own defense.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\n-- The false records charges: Prosecutors say Trump, 77, falsified the records to cover up his reimbursement of Cohen for the payment to Daniels, directing his company to describe the payments as \"legal expenses\" from a retainer agreement. The expenses and agreement were fictional, prosecutors say.\n\n-- Hope Hicks speaks: Trump's former press secretary and White House communications director on Friday described the deep anxiety that gripped Trump's campaign after the revelation of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in October 2016. In nearly three hours on the stand, Hicks also described concerns about a 2016 article in The Wall Street Journal, published days before the election, regarding Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. McDougal's story was purchased by the parent company of The National Enquirer, only to be buried.\n\n-- A gag-order ruling is pending: Judge Juan M. Merchan on Thursday held the trial's second hearing on whether Trump had violated a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses, jurors, court staff and others. Days earlier, Merchan had fined Trump $9,000 for nine violations and threatened him with jail if he continued to violate the order.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retainer_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retainer agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FH.uVXiepd7fLAVLBJaTLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/b4e25b2c528ba75537582b5f4b7f2591", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 1967, "textEnd": 1979}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels.\n\nThe trial has gripped the legal and political establishment as Trump seeks to re-take the White House from President Joe Biden in November's election.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden.\n\nHe also faces charges of illegally storing huge quantities of top-secret documents taken from the White House after his presidency to his home in Florida.\n\ngw/cl/sms", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

It is the only one certain to go to trial before the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nThe other cases charge him with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office.

Prosecutors have kept their witness list secret out of concerns that Trump could try to influence key players in the trial.\n\nTrump has been fined $9,000 by Justice Juan Merchan for violating a gag order barring him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.\n\nMerchan is considering whether to impose another fine for further alleged violations, as prosecutors have requested.\n\nThe main players in the case have yet to testify, including Daniels and Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who handled the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\nLast week the 12 jurors and six alternates who will decide Trump's guilt or innocence heard testimony from Hope Hicks, his former longtime aide who described frantic efforts to respond to stories of alleged affairs and sexual harassment that cropped up in the waning weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHicks grew emotional as she testified that Trump told her to deny that he had sex with Daniels and wanted to keep his wife Melania from hearing about the allegation. That could help Trump's defense, which maintains he made the payment to shield his family rather than deceive voters.\n\nProsecutors say Trump's payment to Daniels corrupted the election by keeping the news from voters, at a time when the Republican Trump's treatment of women was a central issue in his campaign against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThey accuse him of falsifying records to cover up election-law and tax-law violations that elevate the 34 counts he faces from misdemeanors to felonies punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nJurors have also heard from Daniels' former lawyer, Keith Davidson, who helped secure the payment, and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who testified that he worked with Trump to suppress stories that might have hurt his presidential bid.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type":

At the centre of the charges is a $130,000 (\u00a3103,000) hush-money payment by lawyer Michael Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels who alleged she had an affair with Trump.\n\nTrump is accused of covering up payments he had his lawyer make to allegedly conceal a sex scandal before the 2016 election. The former president has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe criminal trial is not only full of legal jargon but also some terms that aren't necessarily something many people will come across in everyday life, making it difficult to fully understand proceedings. We've broken down a few examples of some of the terms that could be heard as the court case continues.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump 'not same man he was 4 years ago' as 'demented speech' shows he's 'deteriorating'\n\nHush money\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, hush money is money paid to somebody to make them keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nProsecutors say three payments were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman, a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 that Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions.\n\nFor all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US\n\nCatch and Kill\n\nThe prosecution alleges Trump \"orchestrated a \"catch and kill\" scheme. In his opening statement, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo explained the term to jurors saying it is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.\" A nondisclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nFormer National Enquirer David Pecker testified that he agreed a \"secret arrangement\" with Trump and his then-attorney Michael Cohen during a meeting at Trump Tower in August 2015. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner.\"\n\nDonald Trump pleaded not guilty to the 34 counts of falsyfiying business records in the first degree Falsifying business records\n\nIt is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison. New York law states that falsifying business records rises to a felony when an individual's \"intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.\"\n\nProsecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks.\n\nThey accused Trump of hiding the hush money and other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations.\n\nConspiracy\n\nWhile Trump is not currently charged with the crime of conspiracy, the term has been used multiple times to refer to his agreement with Pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement.\" Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nColangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election.\"\n\nElection interference\n\nThese terms refer to any effort to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, vote buying, or voter intimidation. In this particular case, prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to conceal important information from voters which could have hurt his campaign.\n\nGag order\n\nMerriam-Webster defines a gag order as a \"judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case\". In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nThis means it bars Trump from commenting publicly on witnesses, jurors and some others connected to the matter. On March 26 Judge Juan M. Merchan imposed a limited gag order, which forbids the former president from directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case.\n\nThe New York judge has already found that Trump has violated the order 10 times, as a result, he's now been fined $10,000 and has been repeatedly warned that jail could follow if he doesn't comply.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hedi_mehrez@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Hedi Mehrez", "type": "author", "isAgency":

(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images)\n\nHope Hicks was gushing in her praise of Donald Trump, the man she followed from the Trump Organization to the White House as part of his inner circle, describing the former president as a \"hard worker\" who ran his multi-billion dollar enterprise like a small family business.\n\nIt may have caused some eyes to roll, but Hicks' commitment to the Trump brand is also what made her emotional testimony last week in the Republican candidate's criminal trial all the more damning: here was a loyal aide - one who has never been the target of a late-night Truth Social rant - backing up the prosecution's argument that a hush payment to an adult film star, unreported in campaign finance documents, was meant to influence the 2016 election.\n\n\"It's really devastating,\" as criminal defense attorney David Oscar Markus said on CNN over the weekend. \"She's an ally of Trump and is seen as someone who still is loyal to Trump in many ways. So when she's up there and crying, it's really tough on the Trump team and it's much different than [Michael] Cohen who has an axe to grind, who will be coming up.\"\n\nThe defense team's argument is that Cohen is a disgruntled former employee out to smear a boss who never gave him a plum White House gig. It was Cohen, the argument goes, that took it upon himself to pay $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for the right to bury her story: that she slept with a married Trump just a few months after his wife, Melania, gave birth.\n\nBut prosecutors say not only was Trump aware of the payment - they've introduced a recording of him discussing it with Cohen - but of the plot to cover it up by falsifying business records. Cohen himself was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in the alleged scheme, in which the cost of buying Daniels' silence was listed as \"legal expenses\" in Trump Organization paperwork; if the intent was to help Trump's presidential campaign, the payment should have been reported as a campaign expense and made public knowledge, prosecutors say.\n\nIn her testimony Friday, Hicks described a Trump campaign in \"crisis,\" rocked by the October 2016 release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which the candidate boasts of sexual assault, and a general feeling that it might not survive another scandal before the November election. It was after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, and before voters headed to the polls, that the decision was made to pay off Daniels.\n\nHicks said she was first made aware of that payment in 2018, after the Wall Street Journal reported on the existence of an agreement with Daniels. At the time, she testified, the president told her that \"Michael [Cohen] had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him and that's what he was doing and he did it out of the kindness of his heart.\"\n\nBut that doesn't sound like Michael Cohen, Hicks admitted under questioning. \"I'd say that would be out of character for Michael,\" she said, adding: \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person.\" (David Pecker, former publisher of the National Enquirer, earlier testified that he had entered into a \"catch-and-kill\" arrangement with Trump and Cohen to buy up potentially damaging stories.)\n\nHicks' testimony did help Trump's defense in one sense: she said Trump was indeed concerned about his wife, Melania, learning about another allegation that he cheated on her with Playboy model Karen McDougal But she also made clear that was not his stated concern in 2018, when Daniels' claim went public; then, she testified, Trump told her it was being talked about now because \"it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nCNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said that Hicks' testimony, speaking to Trump's own political concerns, will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain the argument that he acted only to spare his wife from learning about affairs that he denies ever having.\n\n\"As a matter of law, if the prosecution can show that Trump had a mixed motive - but he would not have made these payments but for the campaign - legally, the judge is going to instruct the jury that's enough to establish the intent to commit a crime,\" Eisen said.\n\nAndrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who worked for special counsel Robert Mueller, argued that Hicks' testimony was more than just damaging to Trump's defense; he said it could be game over.\n\n\"You can really see the end of this coming up fast and furious with the [district attorney] just closing it out on the actual reimbursement scheme, which is something that cannot really be denied credibly by Donald Trump's team,\" Weissmann said on MSNBC.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nHere's some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA political hurricane ... and an actual one\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about groping women without their permission.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies ever having sex with Daniels.\n\nTrump complains frequently that the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president has kept him cooped up in a chilly Manhattan courtroom when he should be out wooing voters as he mounts a comeback White House bid.\n\nOver the weekend, he hosted a bevy of potential vice presidential picks at a Republican Party event in Florida.\n\nThe case features sordid allegations of adultery and secret payoffs, but it is widely seen as less consequential than three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces. It is the only one certain to go to trial before the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nThe other cases charge him with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all three.\n\nIt is unclear who will testify on Monday. Prosecutors have kept their witness list secret out of concerns that Trump could try to influence key players in the trial.\n\nTrump has been fined $9,000 by Justice Juan Merchan for violating a gag order barring him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.\n\nMerchan is considering whether to impose another fine for further alleged violations, as prosecutors have requested.\n\nThe main players in the case have yet to testify, including Daniels and Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who handled the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\nLast week the 12 jurors and six alternates who will decide Trump's guilt or innocence heard testimony from Hope Hicks, his former longtime aide who described frantic efforts to respond to stories of alleged affairs and sexual harassment that cropped up in the waning weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHicks grew emotional as she testified that Trump told her to deny that he had sex with Daniels and wanted to keep his wife Melania from hearing about the allegation. That could help Trump's defense, which maintains he made the payment to shield his family rather than deceive voters.\n\nProsecutors say Trump's payment to Daniels corrupted the election by keeping the news from voters, at a time when the Republican Trump's treatment of women was a central issue in his campaign against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThey accuse him of falsifying records to cover up election-law and tax-law violations that elevate the 34 counts he faces from misdemeanors to felonies punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nJurors have also heard from Daniels' former lawyer, Keith Davidson, who helped secure the payment, and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who testified that he worked with Trump to suppress stories that might have hurt his presidential bid.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Queen in New York and Andy Sullivan in Washington; Editing by Howard Goller)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News

Additional sanctions could await the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\nHere's some of the highlights from the past week:\n\nA political hurricane ... and an actual one\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about groping women without their permission.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered

It came when they got their turn to cross-examine one of the prosecution's witnesses, former Daniels attorney Keith Davidson, who represented the adult film actor at the earliest stages of this scandal. Trump's attorney Emil Bove hammered Davidson with secretly recorded conversations between Davidson and Trump fixer Michael Cohen. In those conversations, Davidson -- who spent much of the week testifying about Cohen's extraordinary efforts to keep Daniels quiet in the days leading up to the 2016 election -- appeared to reveal private conversations with his client that portrayed her as trying to extort Trump.\n\nIt was from this approach to Davidson that a view of Trump's ultimate defense in this case began to take shape. This was not a \"conspiracy\" to illegally influence the 2016 election via unreported in-kind contributions, it seems Trump's attorney's will argue. Instead, it was a shakedown by a porn star making false charges and a sleazy celebrity extortion-artist lawyer of a presidential candidate.\n\nThis defense case will have its benefits and its downsides. First, the upsides: It appears partially supported by some of those audio recordings between Davidson and Cohen that were played for the jury Thursday. In one such recording -- taken March 7, 2018, after the Wall Street Journal had broken the hush money story but while all parties were still denying it -- Davidson suggests that Daniels had \"settler's remorse\" and, hypothetically, when \"you realize you have a lot more leverage, you try to settle it twice.\"\n\nEven more damning, was another recording, this one from April 4, 2018 -- just a few weeks later -- in which Davidson suggested that Daniels, who by that point had fired Davidson and hired Michael Avenatti, was lying in her public suggestions that she had been forced into a settlement.\n\nThat transcript from Davidson's side of the conversation, discussing an upcoming interview set to be given by Anthony Kotzev, then the boyfriend of Daniels' publicist Gina Rodriguez:\n\nThere's also a third such recording, in which Davidson implies that Avenatti was \"lying his ass off\" and Daniels was lying as well when they claimed she had been harassed by an apparent Trump henchman back in 2011.\n\nHow damning is any of this? It's worth remembering that Davidson and Daniels had parted ways at this point and Davidson was being portrayed in the press as a villain who had forced Daniels to take a bum deal, so perhaps it's unsurprising that he was venting to Cohen. Still, even prior to playing the audio, Bove had muddied Davidson up by asking him if these conversations had ever taken place, and getting \"I can't recall\" for answer after answer after answer. (Davidson also could not recall the details of a number of other similar celebrity settlement deals he had allegedly orchestrated over respective sex scandals, involving, among others, Hulk Hogan, Charlie Sheen, and Tila Tequila.)\n\nIrrespective of how transparently uncredible Davidson may seem, this was the first time that the defense began to present something that may be compelling to this jury as a reason to vote to acquit. And as a reminder: All the prosecution has to do is convince one juror that the innocent victim here was Trump, a person who, the defense is arguing, was targeted in an extortion plot by Davidson, a lawyer who had in the past come dangerously close to the line of breaking the law in similar cases. If just one juror is convinced, Trump gets a hung jury (and he will declare that a win).\n\nWhich brings me to the flaws with this defense. The problem is that what it's reaching for is a jury nullification argument -- that is, the strategy doesn't argue the legal merits of the case but leans on the potential emotions of jurors to sympathize with Trump and to vote to acquit, despite the evidence.\n\nAnother problem for the defense is the narrative it could present outside the courtroom. This approach goes after Daniels in a way that might backfire, with her coming off as the victim of Trump's abuse yet again. Given Trump's history with women, and the fact that this trial concerns the question of whether he had been cheating on his wife with a porn star months after the former had given birth, tearing down Daniels might not be the best approach while their client is also a candidate for president.\n\nBut the third problem, and perhaps the biggest one, is that these recordings may actually help disprove one of Trump's other major defenses. Remember, the prosecution has elevated its charges to a felony level specifically because of how it has argued that the payoff counts as campaign finance crimes. One of the former president's responses to that claim is to negate the campaign finance part -- his lawyers argue that Trump agreed to this hush money deal in order to protect his family, not to win an election.\n\n\"The reference to leverage going away after a certain date is totally consistent with a theory that the payments were election-related rather than personal,\" election law expert Richard Hasen told me. \"After all, there is no expiration date on a spouse being pissed off about an affair.\"\n\nIndeed, the suggestion that Daniels was maximizing her \"leverage\" against Trump to receive a payout may serve to undermine her credibility, but it doesn't explain away Trump's own alleged motives and actions. Specifically, it does nothing to rebut former American Media honcho David Pecker's incredibly damning testimony about his scheme with Trump to cover up such stories in order to influence the election, starting during an August 2015 Trump Tower meeting with Trump himself.\n\nThe tapes serve not just the defense. The prosecution has its own recordings of Davidson and Cohen that look much better for its case. One that was played on Thursday, from Oct. 16, 2017, displayed Cohen venting his rage at Trump for his lack of support following what Cohen believed were his own extreme displays of loyalty in the Stormy Daniels matter. \"Who else would do that for somebody, who else?\" Cohen complains. \"What about me? And I can't -- I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, 'I hate the fact that we did it.' \"\n\nIf Cohen gets on the stand and is able to convince the jury that the \"he\" in this statement was Donald Trump and the \"we\" was him and Trump, it might not matter how badly the defense is able to portray Stormy Daniels.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_stahl@slate.com", "name": "Jeremy Stahl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Davidson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Avenatti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Avenatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tila_Tequila", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tila Tequila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Sheen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury nullification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_L._Hasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard L.

DeSantis promotes new Bay County elections chief from within\n\nCrucial witnesses took the stand in the second week of testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial, including a California lawyer who negotiated deals at the center of the case and a longtime adviser to the former president.\n\nJurors heard a potentially pivotal piece of evidence -- a 2016 recording of Trump discussing a plan to buy a Playboy model's silence -- as well as testimony about the wrestler Hulk Hogan and hurricanes, literal and figurative.\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might actually have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client had been effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, claiming to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested had been coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson had \"extracted sums of money from;\" Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he had been involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledge that he had faced an FBI investigation, but was never charged, for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nHope Hicks, a onetime Trump confidant who for years was central in his orbit, described in detail a seminal moment of the 2016 campaign: The Washington Post's disclosure of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks testified. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nThe recording, made public just days before a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is relevant to the case because prosecutors believe it helps explain the frenetic efforts by Trump and allies in the campaign's remaining weeks to try to suppress any additional harmful stories that might arise.\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" story was so intense, Hicks recalled, that it took attention away from an actual storm. Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story.

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies ever having sex with Daniels.\n\nTrump complains frequently that the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president has kept him cooped up in a chilly Manhattan courtroom when he should be out wooing voters as he mounts a comeback White House bid.\n\nOver the weekend, he hosted a bevy of potential vice presidential picks at a Republican Party event in Florida.\n\nThe case features sordid allegations of adultery and secret payoffs, but it is widely seen as less consequential than three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces. It is the only one certain to go to trial before the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nThe other cases charge him with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all three.\n\nIt is unclear who will testify on Monday. Prosecutors have kept their witness list secret out of concerns that Trump could try to influence key players in the trial.\n\nTrump has been fined $9,000 by Justice Juan Merchan for violating a gag order barring him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.\n\nMerchan is considering whether to impose another fine for further alleged violations, as prosecutors have requested.\n\nThe main players in the case have yet to testify, including Daniels and Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who handled the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\nLast week the 12 jurors and six alternates who will decide Trump's guilt or innocence heard testimony from Hope Hicks, his former longtime aide who described frantic efforts to respond to stories of alleged affairs and sexual harassment that cropped up in the waning weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHicks grew emotional as she testified that Trump told her to deny that he had sex with Daniels and wanted to keep his wife Melania from hearing about the allegation. That could help Trump's defense, which maintains he made the payment to shield his family rather than deceive voters.\n\nProsecutors say Trump's payment to Daniels corrupted the election by keeping the news from voters, at a time when the Republican Trump's treatment of women was a central issue in his campaign against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThey accuse him of falsifying records to cover up election-law and tax-law violations that elevate the 34 counts he faces from misdemeanors to felonies punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nJurors have also heard from Daniels' former lawyer, Keith Davidson, who helped secure the payment, and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who testified that he worked with Trump to suppress stories that might have hurt his presidential bid.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Queen in New York and Andy Sullivan in Washington; Editing by Howard Goller)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It happened when they had their turn to cross-examine one of the prosecution's witnesses, Daniels' former lawyer, Keith Davidson, who represented the adult film actor from the early stages of this scandal. Trump lawyer Emil Bove hammered Davidson with secretly recorded conversations between Davidson and Trump fixer Michael Cohen. In those conversations, Davidson, who spent much of the week testifying about Cohen's extraordinary efforts to keep Daniels quiet in the days leading up to the 2016 election, appeared to reveal private conversations with his client that described her as trying to extort Trump.\n\nIt was from this approach by Davidson that the vision of Trump's ultimate defense in this matter began to take shape. This is not a plot to illegally influence the 2016 election via undeclared in-kind contributions, it appears, Trump's lawyers will say. Instead, it was an assault carried out by a porn star making false accusations and a sleazy lawyer and celebrity extortion artist for a presidential candidate.\n\nThis defense will have its advantages and disadvantages. First, the pros: This seems partially supported by some of those audio recordings between Davidson and Cohen that were played to the jury on Thursday. In one of these recordings, taken on March 7, 2018, after the Wall Street Journal broke the hush money story but while all sides were still denying it, Davidson suggests that Daniels had settler remorse and, hypothetically, when you realize you have a lot more weight, you try to adjust it twice.\n\nEven more damning was another recording, this one from April 4, 2018, a few weeks later, in which Davidson suggested that Daniels, who by that time had fired Davidson and hired Michael Avenatti, was lying in her public suggestions that she had been forced to work. regulation.\n\nThis transcript of Davidson's side of the conversation, discussing an upcoming interview to be given by Anthony Kotzev, then-boyfriend of Daniels' publicist Gina Rodriguez:\n\nI wouldn't be surprised at all if he came out and said: You know what? Stormy Daniels, she wanted that money more than you can imagine. I remember hearing her on the phone saying, Fuck Keith Davidson. You better sort this damn thing out. Because if he loses this election, and he will lose if he loses this election, we lose all fucking influence. This case is worth zero. And if that happens, I'm going to sue you because you lost this opportunity. So settle the damn thing. It's a far cry from, you know, being bullied and pushed into settling a case.\n\nThere is also a third such recording, in which Davidson implies that Avenatti was lying and Daniels was also lying when they claimed she was harassed by an apparent Trump henchman in 2011.\n\nHow overwhelming is all of this? It's worth remembering that Davidson and Daniels had split up by this point and Davidson was being portrayed in the press as a bad guy who forced Daniels into a lousy deal, so perhaps it's not surprising that he dumps on Cohen. Yet before even releasing the audio, Bove had bamboozled Davidson by asking if these conversations had ever happened, and getting I don't remember answer after answer after answer. (Davidson also did not recall details of a number of other similar celebrity settlements he allegedly orchestrated following respective sex scandals, involving, among others, Hulk Hogan, Charlie Sheen and Tila Tequila.)\n\nRegardless of Davidson's transparency and unbelievability, this was the first time the defense began to present something that could be compelling to this jury as a reason to vote to acquit. And as a reminder: All the prosecution has to do is convince a juror that the innocent victim here was Trump, a person who the defense claims was the target of an extortion plot by Davidson, a lawyer who came dangerously in the past. close to the line of breaking the law in similar cases. If only one juror is convinced, Trump will have a hung jury (and he will declare it a victory).\n\nWhich brings me to the flaws of this defense. The problem is that what it is aimed at is a jury nullification argument, that is, the strategy does not discuss the legal merits of the case but relies on the potential emotions of the jurors to sympathize with Trump and vote for acquittal, despite the evidence.\n\nAnother problem for the defense is the narrative it might present outside the courtroom. This approach goes after Daniels in a way that could backfire, making her appear once again to be a victim of Trump's abuse. Given Trump's history with women and the fact that this trial is about whether he cheated on his wife with a porn star months after the first gave birth, tearing Daniels down is not perhaps not the best approach when their client is also a presidential candidate.\n\nBut the third, and perhaps most important, problem is that these recordings could actually help refute one of Trump's other major defenses. Remember, the prosecution elevated its charges to the criminal level, specifically because of how it argued that winnings count as campaign finance crimes. One of the responses of former presidents to this claim has been to deny campaign financing. Lawyers say Trump agreed to the hush money deal to protect his family, not to win an election.\n\nJeremy Stahl Tears and hope on the witness stand Read more\n\nThe reference to leverage disappearing after a certain date is entirely consistent with a theory that the payments were election-related rather than personal, election law expert Richard Hasen told me. After all, there's no expiration date for a spouse to be upset about an affair.\n\nA major American scam has led to disorder on college campuses. Everyone fell in love again. Trump's defense brought Hope Hicks to tears. The prosecution got what it wanted. There is one part of Brittney Griners' account of life in the Russian prison that really stands out. Just one thing will end the protests and relieve Joe Biden of this gigantic headache.\n\nIndeed, the suggestion that Daniels was maximizing his influence against Trump to receive payment may serve to undermine his credibility, but it does not explain Trump's so-called motivations and actions. Specifically, it does nothing to refute former US media honcho David Pecker's incredibly damning testimony about his plan with Trump to cover up such stories in order to influence the election, based on a meeting from Trump Tower in August 2015 with Trump himself.\n\nThe recordings are not just for the defense. The prosecution has its own recordings of Davidson and Cohen that appear much better for its case. The one that played on Thursday, starting October 16, 2017, showed Cohen expressing rage at Trump for his lack of support following what Cohen believed to be his own extreme displays of loyalty in the Stormy Daniels affair. Who else would do this for anyone, who else? Cohen complains. And me? And I can't even tell you how many times he told me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it.\n\nIf Cohen takes the stand and can convince the jury that the him in that statement was Donald Trump and the us was him and Trump, it doesn't matter how well the defense is able to portray Stormy Daniels.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Davidson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Avenatti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Avenatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tila_Tequila", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tila Tequila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Sheen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury nullification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_L._Hasen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard L.

That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n____\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_tucker@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jennifer_peltz@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Jennifer Peltz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Michael R.

The porn actor received a $130,000 payment from Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen as part of his hush-money efforts. Cohen paid Daniels to keep quiet about what she says was a sexual encounter with Trump years earlier. Trump denies having sex with Daniels.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's New York criminal trial is full of terms you don't typically hear in a courtroom.\n\nCentering on allegations Trump falsified his company's records to conceal the nature of hush money reimbursements, it's the first ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial. It also has some unique terminology.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nHUSH MONEY\n\nDEFINITION: According to Merriam-Webster, it's money paid so that someone will keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nEXAMPLE: Three payments that prosecutors say were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 that Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a federal campaign violation, among other unrelated crimes. The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., entered into a nonprosecution agreement in exchange for its cooperation with prosecutors. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, declaring that the McDougal deal was a \"prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.\"\n\n'CATCH AND KILL'\n\nDEFINITION: As prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement, \"catch-and-kill\" is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.\" A nondisclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing. But sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he agreed, at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner.\"\n\nPecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same \"catch and kill\" methods, including actor and ex-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and golfer Tiger Woods. Pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help a friend or further his business interests, but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else, like agreeing to an interview or posing for a magazine cover.\n\nFALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS\n\nDEFINITION: This is the criminal charge that's being decided at Trump's New York trial. He is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. It is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee Trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder New York law, a person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes a false entry to be made in a company's business records and does so with an intent to defraud, including intent to commit or hide another crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks. Prosecutors argue Trump's actions were a way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations. His lawyers have said the payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal expenses.\n\nCONSPIRACY\n\nDEFINITION: Trump isn't charged with the crime of conspiracy, but prosecutors at his New York trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his \"eyes and ears\" agreement with Pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement.\" Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Colangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election.\" To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must show that he had intent to commit another crime. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said in court that one of the crimes Trump intended to commit was a violation of a New York election law -- a misdemeanor involving a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nDEFINITION: Any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of a race.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost Trump's chances in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only was the National Enquirer acting as the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed, Pecker testified that the tabloid, at Cohen's behest, printed stories that tarred Trump's opponents. It also published stories that boosted Trump's image.\n\nIt's a different kind of election interference allegation from what Trump is charged with in his Washington and Georgia cases, where he's accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Trump claims that being put on trial while he's campaigning as this year's presumptive Republican nominee is its own form of election interference.\n\nGAG ORDER\n\nDEFINITION: Generally speaking, a gag order is \"a judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case,\" according to Merriam-Webster. In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nEXAMPLE: Judge Juan M. Merchan, acting on a request from prosecutors, imposed a limited gag order on Trump on March 26. It bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case. It also prohibits comments about jurors, prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court's staff, prosecution team or their families.\n\nMerchan expanded the order on April 1, barring Trump from commenting about his family or Bragg's family. The change came after Trump assailed the judge's daughter and made false claims about her on social media.\n\nLast Tuesday, Trump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan lamented that $1,000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing Trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president.\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism, including from witnesses like Cohen and Daniels, and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid a crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy.\n\nFollow Sisak at x.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@register-herald.com", "name": "Michael R.

Prosecutors asked what happened when the \"Access Hollywood\" tape came out. \"The tape was damaging. This was a crisis,\" Hicks said.\n\nThe aftermath of the tape then informed how the campaign responded when the Wall Street Journal reported on Karen McDougal's deal with American Media, Inc. not to speak about an alleged affair as part of a $150,000 agreement\n\nIn the WSJ story, which also mentioned Daniels, Hicks, then a Trump campaign spokesperson, denied that Trump had had affairs with either woman. \"What I told to the Wall Street Journal is what was told to me,\" Hicks said of the denial she gave about the Daniels allegations.\n\nWhen prosecutors finished with their questions and Trump's attorney took the podium, Hicks began crying and appeared to become overwhelmed. She finished her testimony after a brief break.\n\nWhen cross-examining Hicks, Trump's attorney Emil Bove elicited testimony that Trump was also concerned about what his wife would think. Trump asked for the newspapers not to be delivered to his residence the day the story was published, Hicks testified.\n\nJurors hear how Trump responded to 'Access Hollywood' tape: Jurors saw a full transcript of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape Friday, including Trump's infamous \"grab 'em by the p*ssy\" comment, as well as other vulgar language the campaign tried to dismiss as \"locker room talk.\" They did not, however, hear Trump on the tape, as the judge ruled the video would be prejudicial to the jury.\n\nProsecutors are getting closer to the crime: For two weeks, prosecutors have delved deeply into the negotiations that led to hush money payments made to McDougal and Daniels before the 2016 election. But those payments are not illegal on their own. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records stemming from how he allegedly hid the way Cohen was reimbursed for paying $130,000 to Daniels in order to keep her quiet before the 2016 election.

Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: Terms to know in Trump trial\n\n-- What Trump's gag order means in his hush money case\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases.

The area's mostly all Democrat,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Juan M. Merchan said the comments \"not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe gag order bars Trump from making comments about the jurors, key witnesses and some others connected to the criminal trial.\n\nJUDGE FINES TRUMP AGAIN FOR CONTEMPT, THREATENS JAIL TIME\n\nThe judge presiding over former President Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him an additional $1,000 for again violating a gag order barring him from making inflammatory comments about witnesses and jurors.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned on Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time.\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well,\" Merchan said. \"There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. Once the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nThe judge had previously fined Trump $9,000 for nine earlier violations in posts on Truth Social and his website.\n\nTRUMP TALKS COLUMBIA COMMENCEMENT CANCELLATION BEFORE COURT\n\nBefore heading into the courtroom Monday morning, Donald Trump spoke to reporters, relaying familiar complaints about the fairness of the trial, the judge and the gag order that stops him commenting on witnesses and jurors.\n\nHe also noted the breaking news that Columbia University canceled its main commencement following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests.\n\n\"That shouldn't happen,\" he said.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan as witness testimony in his hush money trial enters its third week.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWHO'S BEEN ON\n\nTHE STAND SO FAR\n\nWitness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial is entering its third week on Monday and it remains to be seen who will take the stand next.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, jurors have heard from a host of different people.\n\nFollowing a weeklong jury selection process that began mid-April, jurors heard first from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who among other things explained his pledge to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nFormer White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks on Friday painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTHE WITNESS HEARD, BUT NOT YET SEEN\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nTRUMP EXPECTED IN COURT AS TRIAL ENTERS 12TH DAY\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case.

Hurricane Matthew was dominating the news cycle when Hicks was contacted about the forthcoming story. That didn't last long.\n\n\"The 'Access Hollywood' tape pushed the hurricane off the news?\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Hicks replied.\n\nTrump the extortion target?\n\nTrump may be a criminal defendant, but an element of his defense came into view this past week when one of his lawyers suggested Trump might have been a victim.\n\nAttorney Emil Bove implied during a notably tense cross-examination that his client was effectively targeted for extortion by Keith Davidson, a crucial witness and the lawyer who negotiated hush money deals for two women -- porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump. Trump denies it.\n\nBove name-dropped a gaggle of celebrities he suggested were coerced over the years into paying Davidson's clients eye-popping sums to suppress harmful videos or stories. Among them was actor Charlie Sheen, whom Bove said Davidson \"extracted sums of money from\"; Davidson took issue with the word \"extract\" but said he was involved in \"valid settlements\" with Sheen.\n\nDavidson also acknowledged he faced an FBI investigation but was never charged for allegedly attempting to extort Hogan to head off the release of the professional wrestling star's sex tape.\n\nBy 2016, Bove suggested, Davidson was well-versed in the concept of squeezing celebrities such as Trump.\n\n\"And you did everything that you could to get as close to that line as possible in these negotiations without crossing it, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I did everything I could to make sure my activities were lawful,\" Davidson replied.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n'What do we got to pay for this?'\n\nThe prosecution's key witness, Cohen, has yet to testify -- and Trump might never at all -- but their voices were played in the courtroom in perhaps the most vivid piece of evidence so far.\n\nProsecutors played aloud a September 2016 recording that Cohen made of himself briefing the then-presidential candidate on a plan to buy McDougal's silence with a $150,000 payment. McDougal was prepared to come forward with her account of an extramarital affair with Trump, a disclosure Trump and his allies were determined to prevent in the final days of the election.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump can be heard saying at one point.\n\nThey discuss whether the payment should be done with cash or check. Then the recording cuts out.\n\nThough the existence of the recording surfaced in the summer of 2018 and has long been known to the public, its disclosure to the jury was a dramatic moment meant to establish that the hush money payment was done with Trump's knowledge.\n\nHe appeared visibly irritated as the recording was played. Jurors seemed riveted.\n\nThe recording was hardly the only time Cohen surfaced in court over the past week. When he did, it was generally in a negative light.\n\nDavidson said his introduction to Cohen came in 2011, when Davidson was told that he needed to return an angry call from Cohen over a blog post related to Daniels and Trump. Davidson said Cohen was described to him by Daniels' talent manager as \"some jerk\" who was \"very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nWhen Davidson called Cohen and introduced himself, \"I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.\"\n\nDavidson also recounted a memorable phone conversation with Cohen one month after the 2016 election in which the Trump attorney sounded \"depressed and despondent\" and complained about being passed over for a role in the new Trump administration.\n\n\"He said something to the effect of: 'Jesus Christ. Can you (expletive) believe I'm not going to Washington,'\" Davidson described Cohen as saying. \"'After everything I've done for that (expletive) guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's (expletive) so many times, you don't even know.'\"\n\nThe uncharitable characterizations may help Trump's team in its efforts to undermine Cohen's credibility. But they also could help prosecutors distance themselves from Cohen, subtly indicating to jurors that he is not a teammate but rather someone who simply has information.\n\nTo jail a president\n\nA side issue throughout the trial is what to do about Trump's outside-of-court comments. He repeatedly maligned witnesses and suggested bias on the jury -- all despite a judge's gag order meant to bar him from verbal tirades against key players in the case.\n\nTrump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nYet it remains unclear what, if anything, Judge Juan M. Merchan can do in the event of continued violations. Merchan floated the possibility of jail, which would be unprecedented for a former American president. That also would risk inflaming Trump's base as he pursues the presidency and would further upend the 2024 White House race.\n\nTrump's attorneys insist he needs some leeway to be able to respond to relentless criticism, including from witnesses, and that his candidacy means he's the subject of nonstop news media coverage.\n\nMerchan seemed unpersuaded but jail, for now at least, seems to be no one's desired outcome.\n\n\"Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail,\" prosecutor Chris Conroy said.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the Court's decision this past Tuesday will inform the approach we take to any future violations.\"\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial Tags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@napavalleyregister.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@napavalleyregister.com", "name": "J.

But polls show that conviction is a bad look for a significant number of Republican voters, not to mention Democrats and -- crucially -- independents.\n\nWhatever her explanation, Hicks watermarked the most devastating part of her testimony against her old boss. It'll be easy for the jury, which sits just a few feet away from the witness stand, to remember that the weeping came not at some hard-to-remember moment but shortly after Hicks strongly suggested that President Trump was lying to her in 2018 when he said that Michael Cohen paid off Stormy Daniels \"out of the goodness of his heart\" and without his knowledge.\n\nTrump's denial of knowledge is contradicted by his social media posts and by his deposition in a civil case involving Stormy Daniels, in which he confirms reimbursing Cohen. We will likely hear about that admissible civil case within the next few days.\n\nIn the meantime, the prosecution ended its direct examination of Hicks and sent the jury home for the weekend with a bang: first-hand confirmation that Trump was motivated by concerns about the impending 2016 election.\n\nDay Eleven began with Judge Juan Merchan reminding the defense team before calling in the jury that the \"order restricting extrajudicial statements\" (i.e. gag order) only applied outside the courtroom.\n\nTrump has been saying on the campaign trail that the judge was shutting him up. Now, Merchan was taking pains to set the record straight. He told Trump from the bench that he, as a defendant, has the right to testify about anyone, including (though he mentioned no names) Michael Cohen, Stormy Daniels, and prosecution witnesses. I guess that means that if he's dumb enough to attack jurors to their faces, he's entitled to do that, too.\n\nBut I wondered: Might Trump take this as an inadvertent invitation to make speeches from the witness stand? We'll see. I increasingly think he will testify if only to shake things up, drama-king style.\n\nWith the jury back, the defense began the day with continued cross-examination of Douglas Daus, who works in the DA's office's high-tech analysis unit.\n\nDaus was a highly credible witness throughout. He was an Iraq War veteran who, with Michael Cohen's consent, obtained and analyzed the metadata of Cohen's two iPhones. Because he was the one assigned to validate what was on the phone, the prosecution got to play for the jury (not for the last time) the tape of Trump and Cohen talking about hush money (\"So pay with cash,\" Trump can be heard saying), an important piece of evidence.\n\nOn cross, Emil Bove, one of Trump's attorneys, first made it seem as if he was suspect because he was doing standard work for a district attorney. Then he thoroughly bored the court (including Trump, who caught some shut-eye) with a lot of technical jargon (e.g., \"artifact from CP1\") designed to make it seem as if he knew what he was talking about instead of setting up an improbable conspiracy theory.\n\nHe did this by focusing, Johnnie Cochran-style, on the chain of custody of the phones and Cohen's astonishing 39,745 contacts, 30 times more than even well-connected people possess. Daus explained how there was no evidence of the phones or the audio recordings on them being manipulated in any way. But lacking a complete record of the chain of custody, he admitted in Bove's words, \"presents risks.\"\n\nBove left the extent of the risk to the imagination of conspiracy-minded jurors, though he used innuendo in his questions to bring the FBI and Cohen under suspicion.\n\nI'm told by lawyers that reasonable doubt about the chain of custody is not enough to discredit that evidence, much less the case. But Bove did score by pointing to a nano-second gap in the audio of the key tape, the kind we all get when another call comes in. But because Cohen did not put Trump on hold to take the other call, there is no record of it.\n\nAs the prosecution made clear on redirect, there is also no record of Cohen, the FBI, or anyone else \"manipulating or tampering with audio recorded on the phone.\"\n\nThe next witness was Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal with the DA's office, whose job it was to monitor and log Trump's social media accounts, including the video statement he made after the Access Hollywood tape, where he admitted to saying \"foolish things\" and sort of apologized before launching into an attack on the Clinton's. This testimony offered the first chance to present jurors with various videos and social media posts embarrassing to Trump, like \"YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU!\" last year on Truth Social.\n\nNeither side has released a witness list, so we were all surprised when Hope Hicks strode into the courtroom, clad in a smart black suit and looking more than a little like Ivanka Trump, who helped her get a big job at the Trump Organization when she was only four years out of college. By the next year, she was the communications director for a presidential campaign.\n\nMy take on her tears is that she retains her gratitude for everything Trump has done for her in the last decade. But when that gratitude and her close relationship with Trump came into conflict with her oath to tell \"the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,\" the oath won -- and the understandable pain followed.\n\n\"I'm really nervous,\" she said, adjusting the microphone on the witness stand. But the nerves did not prevent her from being a compelling, appealing, and ultimately devastating prosecution witness.\n\nHicks described Trump as a boss who approved every Tweet and press release, testimony that corroborated David Pecker's testimony depicting Trump as a \"micromanager.\" This will make it harder, though hardly impossible, for the defense to claim that he didn't know that the checks to Michael Cohen were cover for paying off Stormy Daniels.\n\nHicks recounted how David Fahrenthold of The Washington Post emailed her that the Post had learned of what would become known as the Access Hollywood story. He included a full transcript of Trump caught talking to Billy Bush about being able to \"grab 'em by the pussy\" among other disgusting comments.\n\nWhile the tapes were deemed by Merchan as too prejudicial to admit into evidence, the transcript -- after much debate in front of the judge -- is an exhibit. It was not read from today but flashed briefly on the monitors. I didn't see \"pussy,\" but I was able to quickly read: \"And I did try to fuck her. She was married.\"\n\nWhen Hicks brought the transcript to Trump, \"He said that that didn't sound like something he would say.\" In other words, Trump lied to her, which became clear later in the day when the tape itself was obtained. Jurors might suspect that Trump is a liar based on their familiarity with Trump over the years. But this was the first time they heard evidence of it in court.\n\nAnd they heard evidence that his lying is contagious. After Trump lied to her, she instructed her communications staffers to \"deny, deny, deny.\" In other words, to \"lie, lie, lie.\"\n\nAfter the tape aired, she testified that Paul Ryan, John McCain, Mitt Romney, and many others jumped ship, and many Trump staffers thought the campaign was over. \"The tape was damaging. This was a crisis,\" Hicks said, noting that the story was so big it pushed a Category Four hurricane out of the headlines.\n\nShe confirmed exhibits showing that Trump was also very concerned in the last weeks of the 2016 election about The Wall Street Journal story detailing catch-and-kill with the Karen McDougal story, and the jury saw video of Trump on the campaign trail worrying aloud that the multiple accusations of sexual misconduct launched after the Access Hollywood tape might cause him to lose.\n\nHicks apparently knew nothing about Cohen's payoff to Stormy Daniels at the time, but when the story broke in the Journal in early 2018, she and Trump had a fateful chat about it in the White House\n\nIn a rare piece of good news for the defense, she testified that Trump was worried about his wife: \"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to her residence that morning. He was worried about how this would be viewed at home...I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed. He wanted them to be proud of him.\"\n\n\"President Trump really values Mrs Trump's opinion. He really respects what she has to say. And I think he was concerned about what her perception of this would be.\"\n\nBut this testimony was undercut by what the jury heard next:\n\nHicks testified that when the payoff to Stormy Daniels became public in 2018, she and President Trump discussed the matter in the White House, and Trump told her that Michael Cohen had paid the porn star \"out of the kindness of his heart and never told anyone about it.\"\n\n\"I'd say that would be out of character for Michael Cohen,\" Hicks told the jury. \"I didn't know him to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" she said. To the contrary, \"Cohen was \"The kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nA clueless Trump smiled when she later explained that Cohen's moniker as \"Trump's fixer\" came from him. He was a fixer \"only because he broke it so that he could fix it.\"\n\nOf course, this just made her testimony doubting Trump's \"goodness of his heart\" line even more powerful.\n\nThe next part I'm quoting in full from the transcript:\n\nQ. Did he say anything about the timing of the news reporting regarding --\n\nHe wanted to know how it was playing and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story -- a different kind of story before the campaign [election] had Michael not made that payment.\n\nAnd I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\n\nThe defense will presumably argue that any rational candidate would not want the story of a fling with a porn star to come out before an election.\n\nBut the prosecution has built a narrative for the jury that consists of: Trump's frenzied reaction to the Access Hollywood tape; Trump's admissible campaign speeches where he openly worries that the accusations of misconduct from several women in October will cost him 5 to 10 percent of the women's vote; Cohen's sense of urgency in creating a dummy corporation and bank account and wiring the $130,000 to Keith Davidson all within a 24-hour period; and the testimony of Pecker, Davidson and, soon, Cohen.\n\nWith Hicks' testimony, the motive and criminal intent necessary for conviction have been reaffirmed by someone who worked closely with Trump, still admires him, and heard that motive expressed directly to her, not as hearsay testimony.\n\nTrump may have wanted to spare Melania but his first priority was interfering in the election.\n\nNo wonder the prosecutor said, \"No further questions.\"\n\nIt was now time for Bove's gentle cross-examination. For a minute or two, he asked a subdued Hicks about her background.\n\nHe mentioned her first job with the Trump Organization and asked, \"Real estate host and entertainment, that was your portfolio there?\"\n\n\"Yes, she said.\n\nThen, as the transcript reflects, she began softly crying.\n\nThis caused some brief confusion in the courtroom over what we were hearing.\n\nAfter murmuring \"Sorry\" three times, Hicks asked, \"Could I just have a minute?\"\n\nBove requested a break, and the judge asked, \"Do you need a break?\" Between sobs that I could now hear from the second to last row of the courtroom, she said, \"Yes, please.\"\n\nAfter the break, Hicks mostly regained her composure, and Bove's easy cross continued in unmemorable fashion before petering out.\n\nHicks, who had not seen Trump in 18 months, exited the courtroom by walking just three feet to the right of her old boss. She looked straight ahead; he looked away.\n\nTrump should have been thinking this but has never shown any familiarity with Shakespeare:", "source": {"uri": "washingtonmonthly.com", "dataType":

Almost all of them read the New York Times so it's no wonder. But to be fair, no one else knows what Trump's accused of, either. Not the lawyers, not the pundits nor the people they interview. Three weeks in, no one on either side or on the outside knows what the crime is. I heard a Politico reporter tell Brian Lehrer that a prosecutor doesn't have to say what the charges are, but can figure them out as he goes. Lehrer affected that this made perfect sense to him, and I think they're right: Alvin Bragg himself doesn't know what the charges are.\n\nI asked my mom, a reliable barometer for MSM messaging, to explain the crime in Trump's \"hush money\" payments, and she said it's the cover-up. \"That's what an NDA is, Mom. An contract to pay someone not to talk.\"\n\nShe thinks of the hush money as the crime and the cover-up, but simultaneously, thinks the crime is the cover-up of the hush money. In other words, she tracks Bragg's case perfectly. Michael Cohen paying Stormy Daniels and billing Trump for reimbursement could only have been directed by Trump as an illegal scheme to conceal the NDA.\n\nThe problem with that theory is that for the cover-up to be criminal, the act being concealed must also be; but NDA's are legal, routinely-made agreements, especially in N.Y. Knowing this, N.Y. prosecutors cobbled together a tiny Frankenstein of expired misdemeanors from different jurisdictions and brought them back to life by alleging they were done to interfere in elections, to create 34 felonies of a class no neutral judge would accept, which appear to be accounting decisions, and hurl them at a defendant who doesn't do his own accounting.\n\nNever mind that the U.S. Attorney's Office and FEC both declined the election case, and that Bragg, being a local D.A., has no jurisdiction. Never mind that without this federal crime which the feds deemed wasn't a crime, the underlying charges are expired. Never mind the prosecution's testimony violating the collateral evidence rule. Never mind the judge's family generating income from his rulings.\n\nIgnoring these serious problems, the prosecution must not only prove that Trump ordered Daniels' \"hush\" payment to be structured in the way it was, but that he did so deliberately to conceal some other law that he broke, and further that he broke that law to influence the 2016 election and not to protect his marriage, family, or reputation.\n\nWith Daniels, as with Karen McDougal, the payment scheme had another layer. David Pecker at the National Inquirer paid McDougal for her story and didn't publish it. Pecker testified he did the same for Schwarzenegger when he ran for California governor and Rahm Emanuel when running for Chicago mayor. But somehow it became a crime when it benefited Trump.\n\nTrump did not reimburse Pecker for McDougal, hence only being charged for Daniels. Whether or not that played a role, Pecker did not buy Daniels' story and Cohen couldn't convince Trump to, even with Daniels ready to cancel and go public with ABC. As Michael Avenatti told CNN, \" 'It's absolutely laughable' that Trump was not aware of attempts by Cohen to pay Daniels.\"\n\nOn Day Nine of the Trial, Daniels' lawyer for the NDA, Keith Davidson, testified on Cohen missing deadlines to finalize it: \"It was clear, Cohen didn't have the authority to spend money. Finally, he said, 'I'll just do it myself.'\"\n\n\"So let me get this straight,\" Avenatti tweeted. \"Cohen now claims he borrowed $130k on his house and pays interest on it in order to give that same $130k (on behalf of a billionaire) to a woman who according to him was lying.\"\n\nIt can be inferred from Trump's apparent refusal to pay that the allegation was a lie, as Cohen said, or otherwise nonthreatening. Trump didn't want to make the deal (nor did he make it), but Cohen did -- in fact, in Davidson's testimony he sounded desperate to.\n\nClearly threatened by Cohen with a lawsuit, One America News retracted and apologized for a March 27 story they'd covered with the Gateway Pundit of a self-described intelligence contractor, Tony Seragus, who tweeted that he'd shared a Newport Beach office building with Avenatti where Avenatti told him Cohen himself had slept with Daniels starting in 2006, and Cohen had hatched the hush money scheme to extort Trump.\n\nNow if you look at Daniels' original 2011 tell-all interview, the supposed affair with Trump is almost an afterthought. She devoted few words to it and gave no idiosyncratic details: the deed was done in a normal way and didn't happen again, despite her likewise unverifiable claim that Trump called her for years afterward from a blocked number. She named Ben Roethlisberger as a witness to them not having sex the next time they met. So by the looks of things, she didn't expect this to go to court. She wanted the settlement.\n\nViva Frei thinks \"it looks like Cohen might have been involved in a fabricate-to-get-paid scheme, where he would find a scandal\" and arrange to cover it up. Robert Barnes elaborates, \"here's the problem with 'fixers': they often have to create problems that they say they fixed for you, that often are not problems, for you.\" He then lists the reasons Daniels is not Trump's type, suggesting she was not a problem, for Trump -- which matches up with Trump not paying. But Cohen really wanted to fix it, didn't he?\n\nBarnes thinks Cohen \"definitely\" had relations with Daniels. If so, that could be how Cohen found the problem to fix. Why else would he take a loan on his own house to lend the borrowed money to a billionaire? Is it possible that Daniels extorted him originally and they made a deal to extort Trump? Remember, she and McDougal each approached the Inquirer with the same lawyer, Keith Davidson.\n\nDavidson has been sued for extortion by Hulk Hogan, Tila Tequila, Charlie Sheen, and Robert Herjavek of Shark Tank. When The Smoking Gun wrote their profile on him, Davidson was fighting three extortion lawsuits at the same time and allegedly attempted to extort the reporter.\n\nDavidson brought the women to Pecker, who we're told published negative stories about Trump's opponents but \"caught and killed\" stories about Trump, because he wanted Trump to win.\n\nBarnes continues: \"Pecker was involved in his own extortion scheme. That's really what he admitted to on the stand. The scam was, go and buy up stories that could embarrass someone, and then get them to pay you. He's pretending it was always the other way around. Let's just assume it wasn't.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ Associated Press By MICHAEL R. SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him $1,000 for violating his gag order and sternly warned the former president that additional violation could result in jail time.\n\nThe fine marks the second sanction for Trump for inflammatory comments about witnesses since the start of the trial last month. He was fined $9,000 last week for nine violations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time, though he said that was \"the last thing I want to do.\"\n\nProsecutors in Trump's hush money trial are moving deeper into his orbit following an inside-the-room account about the former president's reaction to a politically damaging recording that surfaced in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nHope Hicks, a former White House official and for years a top aide, is by far the closest Trump associate to have taken the witness stand in the Manhattan trial.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n____\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "lacrossetribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Crosse Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_r_sisak@lacrossetribune.com", "name": "Michael R.

The former president denies claims by adult film star Stormy Daniels that they had an affair, but claims he was trying to hide Daniels' allegations from his wife, Melania, not from the voting public.\n\nMarton told Newsweek that the involvement of Hicks in the discussions about Daniels make it harder for Trump's lawyers to claim that the payments were to hide the allegations from Trump's wife, Melania.\n\n\"For the jury, the optics of the campaign press secretary being involved at all makes it harder to claim the payoff was related to some personal matter,\" he said.\n\nMarton said that the Manhattan District Attorney's office \"will use Hope Hicks' testimony as further evidence that the Stormy Daniels payment was done to head off what would have been a devastating political scandal days before the 2016 election - complete with emails and texts as evidence.\"\n\nHowever, he said that her knowledge of the payments is limited and she is a \"non-cooperating\" witness, meaning that she is not charged with any crime and so is under no pressure to divulge every detail.\n\n\"Importantly, Hicks is a non-cooperating witness, and she's previously testified in Congress that she was unaware of the deal itself, so the value of her testimony in connecting Trump to a crime will be limited,\" he said.\n\nHicks testified about the effect that the Stormy Daniels claims had on Trump's 2016 election campaign and on his presidency, rather than on the intricacies of the deal itself.\n\nNew York University law professor Stephen Gillers told Newsweek that Hicks' position as White House communications director gives her evidence credibility.\n\n\"On one hand, Hicks' testimony duplicates Pecker's, adding only marginal information. However, she is a more powerful witness for the prosecution because, unlike Pecker, she was a senior person in the administration and the 2016 campaign and worked for the Trump Organization.\"\n\n\"There is good reason for the jury to trust her testimony because she is seen as a Trump loyalist. I'm sure she doesn't want to be sitting in the witness chair. But unlike some of Trump's former lawyers and aides, Hicks was not going to take a bullet for her former boss,\" he said.\n\nHicks served as a senior White House adviser during the Trump administration, having become a full-time employee of Trump's property company, The Trump Organization, in late 2014.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in an attempt to conceal hush money paid to Daniels and former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, which were facilitated by his former attorney, Michael Cohen. Trump also denies having an affair with McDougal.\n\nThe former president claims that all of his legal troubles -- which include 54 additional felony charges across three other criminal indictments -- are part of a Democrat-orchestrated \"witch hunt\" that amounts to \"election interference\" as he seeks to regain the presidency in November.\n\nDuring her testimony, Hicks agreed with the prosecutor that Cohen would not have made the hush-money payments \"out of the kindness of his own heart\" because he is not \"an especially charitable person or selfless person.\"\n\nAccording to Newsweek reporter Katherine Fung, who was at the courthouse, Hicks began crying shortly after Trump defense lawyer Emil Bove began his cross-examination.\n\nAfter a short break, Hicks glanced at Trump, who had largely avoided eye contact with his former aide, as she made her way back into the courtroom. She then continued with her evidence.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_o_driscoll@newsweek.com", "name": "Sean O'Driscoll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388380/hope-hicks.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9bc99c08f3099d8c70008ca4b9ae07f5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan has reached the third week of testimony, and there are only a few key witnesses who have yet to take the stand.\n\nThere is Stormy Daniels, the porn star who accepted hush money in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign to keep silent about her story of having had sex with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. There is Michael D. Cohen, the Trump fixer who made that payment and is expected to be crucial for the prosecution. And there are several employees of the Trump family business, who helped the then-president reimburse Mr. Cohen.\n\nMr. Trump, the first American president to face criminal prosecution, is charged with 34 felonies related to those reimbursements: The Manhattan district attorney's office says that he coordinated the falsification of documents related to the repayment.\n\nThe exact order of witnesses is unclear, but the trial is zipping along and the prosecution could wrap up in little more than two weeks. Ms. Daniels could testify as soon as this week, bringing her face to face with Mr. Trump, who for years has attacked her.\n\nMr. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied that he had sex with Ms. Daniels. If convicted, he could face probation or as long as four years in prison. He will not testify as part of the prosecution's case; it is unclear whether he will later take the stand in his own defense.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\nThe false records charges: Prosecutors say Mr. Trump, 77, falsified the records to cover up his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen for the payment to Ms. Daniels, directing his company to describe the payments as \"legal expenses\" from a retainer agreement. The expenses and agreement were fictional, prosecutors say.\n\nHope Hicks speaks: Mr. Trump's former press secretary and White House communications director on Friday described the deep anxiety that gripped Mr. Trump's campaign after the revelation of the so-called \"Access Hollywood\" tape in October 2016. In nearly three hours on the stand, Ms. Hicks also described concerns about a 2016 article in The Wall Street Journal, published days before the election, regarding Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump in 2006 and 2007. Ms. McDougal's story was purchased by the parent company of The National Enquirer, only to be buried. Here are five takeaways from Friday's court session.\n\nA gag-order ruling is pending: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, on Thursday held the trial's second hearing on whether Mr. Trump had violated a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses, jurors, court staff and others. Days earlier, Justice Merchan had fined Mr. Trump $9,000 for nine violations and threatened him with jail if he continued to violate the order.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".ms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/06/multimedia/06trump-trial-pinned-01-lfhj/06trump-trial-pinned-01-lfhj-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 1952, "textEnd": 1964}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

That effort, prosecutors say, included hush money payments to a porn actor and Playboy model who both have said they had sexual encounters with Trump before he entered politics.\n\n\"I had a good sense to believe this was going to be a massive story and that it was going to dominate the news cycle for the next several days,\" Hicks said of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, first revealed in an October 2016 Washington Post story. \"This was a damaging development.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe trial enters its third week of testimony Monday with prosecutors building toward their star witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. Cohen is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments made to stifle potentially embarrassing stories. Prosecutors say Trump's company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Cohen for payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and gave Cohen bonuses and extra payments. Prosecutors allege that those transactions were falsely logged in company records as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denied sexual encounters with any of the women, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard from witnesses including a tabloid magazine publisher and Trump friend who bought the rights to several sordid tales about Trump to prevent them from coming out and a Los Angeles lawyer who negotiated hush money deals on behalf of both Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have tried to chip away at the prosecution's theory of the case and the credibility of some witnesses. They've raised questions during cross-examinations about whether Trump was possibly a target of extortion, forced to arrange payouts to suppress harmful stories and spare his family embarrassment and pain. Prosecutors maintain the payments were about preserving his political viability as he sought the presidency.\n\nThe case is one of four Trump prosecutions and possibly the only one that will reach trial before the November election. Other felony indictments charge him with plotting to subvert the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden and illegally hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\n____\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_tucker@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Michael R.

the 2016 election, they could \"avoid paying altogether.\" , because at this point it wouldn't matter if the story became public.\"\n\nElsewhere during Thursday's proceedings, Bove suggested Davidson considered breaking the law when he sought money from celebrities to prevent potentially embarrassing stories about them from being made public, including an attempt alleged to get money from wrestler Hulk Hogan in exchange for a sex tape.\n\n\"You were pretty good at getting to the finish line without committing extortion, weren't you?\" \" asked Bov\u00e9.\n\nDavidson has denied ever committing

It also has some unique terminology.\n\nDEFINITION: According to Merriam-Webster, it's money paid so that someone will keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nEXAMPLE: Three payments that prosecutors say were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 that Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a federal campaign violation, among other unrelated crimes. The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., entered into a nonprosecution agreement in exchange for its cooperation with prosecutors. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, declaring that the McDougal deal was a \"prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.\"\n\nRELATED: Trump fined $1,000 for gag order violation in hush money case as judge warns of possible jail time\n\n'CATCH AND KILL'\n\nDEFINITION: As prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement, \"catch-and-kill\" is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.\" A nondisclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing. But sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he agreed, at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner.\"\n\nPecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same \"catch and kill\" methods, including actor and ex-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and golfer Tiger Woods. Pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help a friend or further his business interests, but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else, like agreeing to an interview or posing for a magazine cover.\n\nFALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS\n\nDEFINITION: This is the criminal charge that's being decided at Trump's New York trial. He is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. It is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee Trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder New York law, a person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes a false entry to be made in a company's business records and does so with an intent to defraud, including intent to commit or hide another crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks. Prosecutors argue Trump's actions were a way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations. His lawyers have said the payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal expenses.\n\nCONSPIRACY\n\nDEFINITION: Trump isn't charged with the crime of conspiracy, but prosecutors at his New York trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his \"eyes and ears\" agreement with Pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement.\" Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Colangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election.\" To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must show that he had intent to commit another crime. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said in court that one of the crimes Trump intended to commit was a violation of a New York election law -- a misdemeanor involving a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nDEFINITION: Any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of a race.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost Trump's chances in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only was the National Enquirer acting as the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed, Pecker testified that the tabloid, at Cohen's behest, printed stories that tarred Trump's opponents. It also published stories that boosted Trump's image.\n\nIt's a different kind of election interference allegation from what Trump is charged with in his Washington and Georgia cases, where he's accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Trump claims that being put on trial while he's campaigning as this year's presumptive Republican nominee is its own form of election interference.\n\nGAG ORDER\n\nDEFINITION: Generally speaking, a gag order is \"a judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case,\" according to Merriam-Webster. In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nEXAMPLE: Judge Juan M. Merchan, acting on a request from prosecutors, imposed a limited gag order on Trump on March 26. It bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case. It also prohibits comments about jurors, prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court's staff, prosecution team or their families.\n\nMerchan expanded the order on April 1, barring Trump from commenting about his family or Bragg's family. The change came after Trump assailed the judge's daughter and made false claims about her on social media.\n\nLast Tuesday, Trump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan lamented that $1,000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing Trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president.\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism, including from witnesses like Cohen and Daniels, and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid a crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy.", "source": {"uri": "thedailyrecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maryland Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thedailyrecord.com", "name": "Associated Press",

When Trump's campaign learned that the Washington Post was going to publish a recording where Trump bragged about groping women and grabbing them \"by the pussy\", Hicks said staffers thought \"this was a crisis\".\n\nAs Trump tried to downplay the remarks as \"locker room talk,\" it was even more imperative that any alleged boorishness remained related to words - not actions - for the sake of his campaign. Allegations about physical impropriety emerged soon thereafter, however, prompting Cohen's scramble to conceal Daniels' account, prosecutors say.\n\nHicks also recalled a conversation with Trump in the wake of a February 2018 New York Times article in which Michael Cohen said that he had paid Daniels before the election but insisted it was not a campaign contribution. The Times article came in the wake of a Wall Street Journal article that uncovered Cohen's payment to Daniels.\n\n\"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story - a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment,\" Hicks recalled Trump saying in response to prosecutor Matthew Colangelo's question.\n\n\"And I think Mr Trump's opinion was [that] it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nHicks' recollection of Trump's commentary on timing was her final statement on direct testimony.\n\nShe started crying right after cross-examination commenced. Hicks said \"um, yes, please\" if she needed a break. She exited judge Juan Merchan's courtroom with a crumpled piece of tissue in her hand.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pussy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_guardian_765/a1e7e8c717f02dd10203fd7ef9091b19", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-02-", "textStart": 1847, "textEnd": 1860}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

(Mark Peterson-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is on trial in New York for 34 counts of falsifying business records in what prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's office allege was a scheme to cover up negative press during the 2016 election cycle.\n\nThe trial last week featured several key testimonies and pieces of evidence.\n\nKeith Davidson, the attorney who represented Stephanie Clifford (Stormy Daniels) and brokered the $130,000 deal paid by Michael Cohen, pushed back on prosecutors' claim that the payment was \"hush money,\" arguing it was consideration in a legal settlement paid by Mr. Cohen alone.\n\nHope Hicks, former communications director for the 2016 Trump Campaign and in the White House, told jurors how President Trump had reacted to news of the payment, and how she found his explanation that Mr. Cohen had done it out of the \"goodness of his heart\" out of character for the ex-lawyer.\n\nMs. Hicks broke down in tears on the witness stand as cross-examination by the defense began, and described for the court how Mr. Cohen would go \"rogue\" and she would joke that he only called himself a fixer because he fixed what he broke himself in the first place.\n\nSeveral recordings of revealing conversations between Mr. Cohen and others -- Mr. Davidson, President Trump -- were also played in court. Defense attorneys then questioned an employee of the district attorney's office in charge of processing digital evidence, who affirmed there were gaps in handling the devices from which evidence was pulled, making it possible for the evidence to be incomplete. For instance, audio recordings pulled from Mr. Cohen's phone were shorter than the actual phone calls.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is also set to rule on four gag order violation allegations after having fined President Trump $9,000 for nine other violations.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/id990876-GettyImages-2150550456-1200x630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Monday, May 6th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, a look at new polling surrounding Trump and Biden. Plus, we look ahead to this week's hush money trial testimony after we heard from Hope Hicks on Friday and the cicadas are here.\n\nWell, it's a tie. Six months before election day, president Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are tied at 37% apiece in an exclusive USA TODAY Suffolk University poll, but plenty of votes are up for grabs. 24% of registered voters say they might change their minds ahead of November's election, and 12% have not made a choice yet. Meanwhile, 8% are now supporting independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and an additional 5% are backing other third party contenders. Most of their supporters acknowledge they might switch their allegiances before casting a ballot. The new poll shows Biden closing a gap on Trump in recent months, though within the survey's margin of error, in the USA TODAY Suffolk poll taken in January, Biden trailed Trump by three points, and in March he trailed by two. Now they're even. Biden since January has also gained ground among some key voters while Trump lost it, including among voters under 35. Among Hispanic voters, Biden's support has stayed the same, but Trump has lost 11 points. You can read more with the link in today's show notes.\n\nAnother week of former president Donald Trump's New York hush money trial will see a new witness take the stand. Last week, a lawyer who represented former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, testified about his efforts to get her story of an affair with Trump into the hands of the national Enquirer during the 2016 presidential campaign. But the week's most pivotal testimony came Friday when former top Trump aide Hope Hicks broke down crying on the stand. I caught up with USA TODAY Justice Department Correspondent Aysha Bagchi for more on that and a look ahead at what to expect this week.\n\nSo Aysha, we heard Friday from former top Trump aide, Hope Hicks, who took the stand. Can you remind us who Hope Hicks is and what did we hear from her testimony?\n\nHope Hicks is someone who has a long history with the Trump family. She worked for Ivanka Trump once upon a time, and then she went on to work for the Trump organization and she became his campaign press secretary during the 2016 presidential campaign. She went on to become his communications director in the White House. So she was involved when the Trump campaign had to deal with scandals that were coming out like the Access Hollywood tape, like alleged hush money deals involving allegations of affairs with Donald Trump. So she had a lot of testimony about some pretty salacious things that have happened in Trump's history.\n\nYeah, so what did we hear specifically in this testimony?\n\nOne huge thing we heard was basically the fallout from the 2016 Trump campaign after the Access Hollywood tape got released. We saw an email that Hope Hicks sent after she received an email from a reporter from the Washington Post saying they had this tape and did the Trump campaign have any comment? And the Washington Post reporter sent a transcript of the tape, so she got to read what the reporter said, the tape showed. What we really saw was how the Trump campaign reacted when they first learned about it. And you can see Hope Hicks sent an email very quickly afterwards about how to respond. And in the email she kind of listed out a two-step process. One was to figure out if this was legitimate, and number two was \"Deny, deny, deny.\"\n\nAnd there's a big reason why it's relevant to the prosecution's case. They want to argue that the hush money deals that happened with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, right before the 2016 election was happening, was related to the release of the Access Hollywood tape, that the Trump campaign was really concerned about Trump's status with women voters after that tape came out, and that gave Trump a motivation to make sure that the hush money was paid to keep the Stormy Daniels allegations quiet.\n\nAnd Trump wants to argue that no, this had to do with something else, if I had anything to do with that payment at all, that it was really about protecting my family or some other reason... Because for the prosecution to prove that he committed felonies, they have to show not only that he falsified records having to do with that payment, but also that he did it to conceal another crime. And what they say is the other crime was a campaign finance violation through the hush money payment. But if he can show that no, the hush money payment was not about the campaign, then maybe he can get out of one of their arguments for why these are felonies.\n\nAnd you talk about Trump, there have been questions over whether we'll hear Trump himself testify. What's the latest there?\n\nYes, we saw an argument at the end of court on Friday about what the prosecution can ask Donald Trump if he testifies. That certainly seems to suggest that the defense is entertaining the idea that Donald Trump may testify, and then on Thursday, at the end of the day, he told reporters he wasn't going to testify and he mentioned the gag order as a reason that he's limited in what he can testify to. That is not true. And on Friday morning the judge made that clear. He said that there may be a misunderstanding about the gag order. It only applies to statements outside of court. You have an absolute right to testify and the gag order doesn't limit your testimony in any way. So it seems like it's still up in the air that he may testify.\n\nSo Aysha, the trial starts back up today. What can we expect this week?\n\nHope Hicks sent in her testimony on Friday, but the prosecution doesn't have to disclose who they're going to call next. Hope Hicks's was the biggest name to testify so far, so that might be an indication that other big names are coming. We know that porn star, Stormy Daniels, could testify. We know that former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, might testify. We know that Michael Cohen is a potential witness and he's been a huge subject in the trial so far. Judge Juan Merchan has already held Trump in criminal contempt for what he deemed were nine violations of his gag order, but prosecutors have brought up four more and the judge still has to issue a decision on that. The judge did warn Trump last time that future violations could mean incarceration, jail time.\n\nAysha Bagchi covers the Justice Department for USA TODAY. Thank you Aysha.\n\nThanks Taylor.\n\nIsrael has called on civilians to evacuate parts of Rafah today in southern Gaza. Three Israeli soldiers were killed and a rocket attack claimed by the Hamas armed wing and at least 19 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire yesterday. Israel's military said 10 projectiles were launched from Rafah towards the area of the crossing, which it said was now closed to aid trucks going into the coastal enclave. Other crossings remained open. Hamas's armed wing said it fired rockets at an Israeli army base by the crossing and its media quoted a source close to the group saying \"The commercial crossing was not the target,\" according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Arab media giant Al Jazeera said yesterday that it would pursue every legal step to continue operations in Israel, hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet voted to shut down the Qatar-based global outlet's offices in Israel until the war in Gaza ends.\n\nNetanyahu, who has long accused Al Jazeera of bias toward Hamas, said the cabinet determined the outlet was a threat to national security. Stateside, University of Southern California officials closed their main campus and brought in police to tear down an encampment yesterday as pro-Palestinian protests continue to sweep across the nation's universities and law enforcement is increasingly called in to disband the demonstrations.\n\nAs we talked about on the show last month, a double brood of cicadas is emerging this spring and the rare event has already been spotted in parts of the south and Midwest. I spoke with USA TODAY National Correspondent, Elizabeth Weiss, about why scientists are greeting the phenomenon with a mix of awe, curiosity, and humor. Hello, Beth.\n\nHey, how's it going?\n\nGood, good. Thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today. So Beth, what's coming this spring, already here in some places, when it comes to this massive emergence of cicadas?\n\nYou'll only get to see them if you live east of the Great Plains states. And we've got brood 13 and brood 14, we are talking up to a trillion insects that are going to dig their way out of the ground, fly around for a while, make a whole lot of noise, mate, and then die.\n\nWhy do they emerge from underground in this way and what decides when they pop out?\n\nFirst off, they spend a long time, 13 or sometimes 17 years underground in this nymph form where they basically suck from the roots of trees and they go through their maturation process. And then, only when the temperature of the soil reaches 64 degrees do they come up. And the only thing they're there for is to mate. And that's where it gets really noisy because all the males start singing, trying to attract females .\n\nAnd Beth, how rare is it for these different cicada broods to overlap? And also, will they interact or reproduce with one another?\n\nOh, boy. There's a lot of grad students who are hoping to write their PhD theses on that, let me tell you. They're called periodic cicadas. They usually don't overlap. These two broods have not overlapped for 221 years. So the last time was 1803. The overlap of where these broods are is really small. It's just a couple of counties in Illinois, so there's not going to be a lot of opportunity to interbreed. Typically in the wild, they don't. You can force them to do it in the lab, but in nature they mostly don't because actually the males sing it a slightly different pitch, and if I'm a 17-year cicada female, maybe I don't like the 13-year Cicada males song. I don't know.\n\nWhen it comes to cicadas relationship with humans, are we hurting them? Can they hurt us? What should folks know here?\n\nOh, they totally can't hurt us. One guy I talked to, he's actually the Smithsonian and he's like, they're just kind of goofy. I mean, they come out, they don't fly that well, they don't eat anything that we care about. They won't eat your garden, they won't eat your flowers. They will nibble a little at trees, but normally speaking, they're not going to hurt anything in your yard. They're not toxic. They're not poisonous. Your dog can eat them, your cats can eat them. So there is nothing about a cicada that can hurt you. But boy, are there things about humans that can hurt cicadas. Imagine being a scientist and you do an experiment and you know that the results of that experiment will not be available for 17 years.\n\nSo like one guy, he was in an area and he looked, okay, here's where the cicadas are coming up, and they only, only come up under trees because they're down under the trees taking nourishment off of the roots. And so he looked to where all they were coming up, and then he watched that space for 17 years. The trees all got cut down and they put down a parking lot. Well, cicadas can do a lot of things, but they cannot dig their way through cement. So he came back 17 years later and no cicadas were able to come up. That whole area of cicadas was just gone. So when we go in and clear cut a forest, when we create a parking lot, when anything that humans do that takes away their natural environment, we do cut into where they can live.\n\nElizabeth Weiss, National Correspondent for USA TODAY. Thank you Beth.\n\nAs always, happy to be here.\n\nIt's Met Gala Monday, formerly called \"The Costume Institute Benefit,\" the event is a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York city's Costume Institute. Last year, the event raised a record more than $22 million, according to Vogue Business, and it's a huge night for fashion. It often brings experimental looks, like Zendaya waving goodbye to her Disney roots in a Cinderella ball gown or Kim Kardashian in Marilyn Monroe's iconic 'Happy birthday, Mr. President' dress.

It also has some unique terminology.\n\nDEFINITION: According to Merriam-Webster, it's money paid so that someone will keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nEXAMPLE: Three payments that prosecutors say were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 that Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a federal campaign violation, among other unrelated crimes. The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., entered into a nonprosecution agreement in exchange for its cooperation with prosecutors. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, declaring that the McDougal deal was a \"prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.\"\n\n'CATCH AND KILL'\n\nDEFINITION: As prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement, \"catch-and-kill\" is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.\" A nondisclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing. But sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he agreed, at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner.\"\n\nPecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same \"catch and kill\" methods, including actor and ex-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and golfer Tiger Woods. Pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help a friend or further his business interests, but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else, like agreeing to an interview or posing for a magazine cover.\n\nFALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS\n\nDEFINITION: This is the criminal charge that's being decided at Trump's New York trial. He is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. It is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee Trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder New York law, a person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes a false entry to be made in a company's business records and does so with an intent to defraud, including intent to commit or hide another crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks. Prosecutors argue Trump's actions were a way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations. His lawyers have said the payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal expenses.\n\nCONSPIRACY\n\nDEFINITION: Trump isn't charged with the crime of conspiracy, but prosecutors at his New York trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his \"eyes and ears\" agreement with Pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement.\" Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Colangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election.\" To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must show that he had intent to commit another crime. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said in court that one of the crimes Trump intended to commit was a violation of a New York election law -- a misdemeanor involving a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nDEFINITION: Any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of a race.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost Trump's chances in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only was the National Enquirer acting as the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed, Pecker testified that the tabloid, at Cohen's behest, printed stories that tarred Trump's opponents. It also published stories that boosted Trump's image.\n\nIt's a different kind of election interference allegation from what Trump is charged with in his Washington and Georgia cases, where he's accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Trump claims that being put on trial while he's campaigning as this year's presumptive Republican nominee is its own form of election interference.\n\nGAG ORDER\n\nDEFINITION: Generally speaking, a gag order is \"a judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case,\" according to Merriam-Webster. In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nEXAMPLE: Judge Juan M. Merchan, acting on a request from prosecutors, imposed a limited gag order on Trump on March 26. It bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case. It also prohibits comments about jurors, prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court's staff, prosecution team or their families.\n\nMerchan expanded the order on April 1, barring Trump from commenting about his family or Bragg's family. The change came after Trump assailed the judge's daughter and made false claims about her on social media.\n\nLast Tuesday, Trump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan lamented that $1,000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing Trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president.\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism, including from witnesses like Cohen and Daniels, and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid a crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sisak at x.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver KDVR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kdvr.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@kdvr.com", "name": "Michael R.

Bove pressed Davison on whether he represented clients to \"extract\" settlements from celebrities; Davidson took issue with the word.\n\n\"We're both lawyers,\" Bove told Davidson. \"I'm not here to play lawyer games with you.\"\n\nDavidson wrangled over words with the prosecution, too. When questioned by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass on how the statements he crafted for Daniels' denying the affair following reports of the payment in 2018 could be \"technically true,\" Davidson said a strict reading would be true.\n\n\"I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that any interactions between she and Mr. [Donald] Trump was romantic,\" Davidson said, keying in on the last word to distinguish it from a \"sexual encounter.\"\n\nOn a similar question about how denying a \"sexual relationship\" was true, Davidson noted it was never alleged that they had a \"relationship.\"\n\nDavidson said he would not use the term \"hush money\" to describe the payment to Daniels and would rather call it \"consideration\" in a civil settlement. Several media outlets have published stories with headlines that continue to refer to the trial as a \"hush money\" case.\n\nAnother key point came when Bove asked Davidson if he recalled saying Daniels had \"settler's remorse\" or ever used the word \"leverage\" in a conversation with Michael Cohen. Davidson was asked to listen to portions of the conversation -- which Cohen had recorded without his knowledge at the time -- after he said he could not recall the details.\n\nA grand jury indicted Trump in March 2023 on 34 felony counts for allegedly falsifying business records related to a payment made to keep Daniels quiet about her claims of a sexual encounter. Prosecutors are seeking to demonstrate Trump falsified the records in service of a broader \"conspiracy\" to interfere with the 2016 election.\n\nBove's questioning of Davidson suggested an alternate explanation to the Daniels payment: Trump was another victim of the attorney's extortion efforts.\n\nIn the course of his testimony, Davidson also managed to cast even greater doubt on the already doubtful trustworthiness of the prosecution's star witness, Cohen, who he said could be a \"very aggressive guy.\" Stories recounted by Davidson made Cohen appear unstable, such as one expletive-laced phone call Davidson says he received from Cohen after the 2016 election airing frustration about not landing a place in the Trump administration.\n\n\"'I've saved that guy's a- so many times, you don't even know,\" Davidson recalled Cohen saying.\n\nCohen had been gunning for a position as high as attorney general, Davidson later said, noting he thought Cohen was \"going to kill himself\" after that call.\n\nAt the end of his cross-examination, Bove pointed to the signatures page of the agreement with Daniels, highlighting the fact that Davidson never saw a version signed by \"David Dennison,\" Trump's pseudonym.\n\nThe 10th day of the trial, which began with another hearing on four new alleged violations of Trump's gag order, concluded with the introduction of a new witness, Douglas Daus, an analyst in the High Technology Analysis Unit at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\n\nDaus, who analyzed two of Cohen's cellphones, took the stand to explain the technicalities of extracting data from Cohen's phone. On cross-examination, Bove aimed his questions at the integrity of the evidence. Daus is expected to resume his testimony on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelynn_richardson@dailysignal.com", "name": "Katelynn Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tila_Tequila", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tila Tequila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Sheen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2024/05/GettyImages-2102446472.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

It also features some unique terminology.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nDefinition: According to Merriam-Webster, it's money paid so that someone will keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nExample: Three payments prosecutors say were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a federal campaign violation, among other unrelated crimes. The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., entered into a non-prosecution agreement in exchange for its co-operation with prosecutors. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, declaring the McDougal deal a \"prohibited corporate in-kind contribution\".\n\nDefinition: As prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement, \"catch and kill\" is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a non-disclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day\". A non-disclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nExample: Tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing. But sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he agreed, at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner\".\n\nPecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same \"catch and kill\" methods, including actor and ex-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and golfer Tiger Woods. Pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help a friend or further his business interests, but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else, like agreeing to an interview or posing for a magazine cover.\n\nDefinition: This is the criminal charge that's being decided at Trump's New York trial. He is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. It is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee Trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder New York law, a person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes a false entry to be made in a company's business records and does so with an intent to defraud, including intent to commit or hide another crime.\n\nExample: Prosecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks. Prosecutors argue Trump's actions were a way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations. His lawyers have said the payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal expenses.\n\nDefinition: Trump isn't charged with the crime of conspiracy, but prosecutors at his New York trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his \"eyes and ears\" agreement with Pecker and the hush-money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement\". Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nExample: Colangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election\". To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must show he had intent to commit another crime. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said in court one of the crimes Trump intended to commit was a violation of a New York election law - a misdemeanor involving a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.\n\nDefinition: Any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of a race.\n\nExample: Prosecutors allege the hush-money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost Trump's chances in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only was the National Enquirer acting as the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed, Pecker testified the tabloid, at Cohen's behest, printed stories that tarred Trump's opponents. It also published stories that boosted Trump's image.\n\nIt's a different kind of election interference allegation from what Trump is charged with in his Washington and Georgia cases, where he's accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to Democrat and current US President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Trump claims being put on trial while he's campaigning as this year's presumptive Republican nominee is its own form of election interference.\n\nDefinition: Generally speaking, a gag order is \"a judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case\", according to Merriam-Webster. In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nExample: Judge Juan M. Merchan, acting on a request from prosecutors, imposed a limited gag order on Trump on March 26. It bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case. It also prohibits comments about jurors, prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court's staff, prosecution team or their families.\n\nMerchan expanded the order on April 1, barring Trump from commenting about his family or Bragg's family. The change came after Trump assailed the judge's daughter and made false claims about her on social media.\n\nLast Tuesday, Trump was assessed a $9000 fine - $1000 for each of nine separate gag order violations the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan lamented that $1000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing Trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president.\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism, including from witnesses like Cohen and Daniels, and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid a crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies Daniels' assertion they had sex.\n\nAfter Mr Davidson testified that, as then-lawyer for Daniels, he arranged the US$130,000 (S$175,000) payment with Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, Mr Bove asked about Mr Davidson's alleged efforts to seek cash from Hulk Hogan in exchange for a sex tape involving the former pro wrestler.\n\nHe also asked Mr Davidson about attempts to trade embarrassing information for cash from celebrities including actor Charlie Sheen and reality TV star Tila Tequila.\n\n\"You were pretty well-versed in getting right up to the line without committing extortion, right?\" Mr Bove asked.\n\nMr Davidson denied ever committing extortion.\n\nTrump's lawyers are likely to take a similar tack with other expected witnesses including Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Mr Cohen, who has served prison time for his role in the payment scheme.\n\nMr Davidson confirmed Daniels signed a non-disclosure agreement with Trump to keep quiet about a 2006 sexual encounter, but said he would not describe the payment as hush money. \"It was consideration in a civil settlement agreement,\" he said.\n\nMr Davidson said the forceful denial he helped Daniels craft when the payment was revealed in 2018 did not amount to a lie because it referred to a \"romantic sexual\" relationship rather than a one-off sexual encounter.\n\n\"You have to go through it word by word, and I think if you did so, it would technically be true with an extremely fine reading,\" Mr Davidson said.\n\nDaniels later disavowed the

When Trump's campaign learned that the Washington Post was going to publish a recording where Trump bragged about groping women and grabbing them \"by the pussy\", Hicks said staffers thought \"this was a crisis\".\n\nAs Trump tried to downplay the remarks as \"locker room talk,\" it was even more imperative that any alleged boorishness remained related to words - not actions - for the sake of his campaign. Allegations about physical impropriety emerged soon thereafter, however, prompting Cohen's scramble to conceal Daniels' account, prosecutors say.\n\nHicks also recalled a conversation with Trump in the wake of a February 2018 New York Times article in which Michael Cohen said that he had paid Daniels before the election but insisted it was not a campaign contribution. The Times article came in the wake of a Wall Street Journal article that uncovered Cohen's payment to Daniels.\n\n\"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story - a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment,\" Hicks recalled Trump saying in response to prosecutor Matthew Colangelo's question.\n\n\"And I think Mr Trump's opinion was [that] it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nHicks' recollection of Trump's commentary on timing was her final statement on direct testimony.\n\nShe started crying right after cross-examination commenced. Hicks said \"um, yes, please\" if she needed a break.

Merchan fined the former president $1,000 and warned that going forward, additional violations could result in jail time. Prosecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nWitness testimony resumed following Merchan's ruling, with former Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney taking the stand -- setting the stage for an even deeper dive into the events and people involved in what prosecutors have said was a scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories about the then-candidate.\n\nThe trial is in its 12th day.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Hope Hicks took the stand last week, recounting how Trump's campaign was turned upside-down following the leak of a video wherein he bragged about grabbing women without their permission.\n\nKeith Davidson, who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Read the judge's ruling on Trump's most recent gag order violation\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: Terms to know in Trump trial\n\n-- What Trump's gag order means in his hush money case\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nMCCONNEY SPEAKS ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN\n\nAs prosecutors in Donald Trump's hush money trial shifted their questions to the subject of Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, Jeffrey McConney, like multiple witnesses before him, didn't seem to be a fan.\n\nAsked if he was familiar with the former Trump fixer, McConney paused briefly, before adding: \"I've had conversations with him by the coffee machine.\"\n\nIn response to a question about Cohen's position within the Trump Organization, McConney responded dryly: \"He said he was a lawyer.\"\n\nFORMER EXEC RECALLS EARLY LESSON FROM TRUMP\n\nIn an anecdote from early in his career, former Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney testified in court about Donald Trump's close attention to his cash and hardball approach to bills.\n\nWhen he went to drop off a report on Trump's desk one day in the late 1980s, he said, the then-real estate mogul looked up while on the phone and said, \"Jeff, you're fired.\"\n\nMcConney was taken aback. Then Trump added, according to the ex-controller: \"You're not fired, but my cash balances went down from last week.\"\n\nMcConney said he explained that various expenses had come up. Trump responded that he should \"focus on my bills, negotiate my bills.\"\n\n\"It was a teaching moment,\" McConney recalled. \"If someone's asking for money, negotiate with them,\" rather than just paying.\n\nFrom the defense table, the former president appeared to enjoy hearing the story, lifting his chin and smiling broadly in McConney's direction.\n\nSTUDENTS WATCH TRIAL FROM OVERFLOW ROOM\n\nPeople watching Donald Trump's hush money trial from the courthouse were joined in the overflow room Monday morning by a group of students from a Manhattan private school, who said they were given the morning off to attend.\n\n\"That's him!\" one of the high schoolers yelped earlier in the morning as Trump appeared on the video monitor. She was promptly shushed by one of her classmates.\n\nFORMER TRUMP ORGANIZATION CONTROLLER TAKES STAND\n\nFormer Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney took the stand Monday morning in Donald Trump's hush money case.\n\nMcConney worked for the company for more than three decades, retiring last year after he was granted immunity in exchange for testifying for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial. During that trial, he admitted breaking the law to help fellow executives avoid taxes on company-paid perks. The company was convicted and is appealing.\n\nMcConney, who left with $500,000 in severance, went on to testify tearfully last fall at the civil fraud trial of Trump, the company and key executives. The ex-controller said he'd been worn out by his entanglement in a litany of Trump-related investigations and legal proceedings.\n\n\"I just wanted to relax and stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I loved working for,\" he said at the time.\n\nTHE COMMENT THAT VIOLATED THE GAG ORDER\n\nThe judge in Donald Trump's hush money case found on Monday that Donald Trump had violated his gag order with comments he gave to a program called \"Just the News No Noise\" on April 22, which is broadcast on Real America's Voice.\n\nOn the program, the former president criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats. \"The jury was picked so fast. 95 percent Democrats. The area's mostly all Democrat,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Juan M. Merchan said the comments \"not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\n\n\"Defendant is hereby put on notice that if appropriate and warranted, future violations of its lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration,\" the judge wrote in the order.\n\nThe gag order bars Trump from making comments about the jurors, key witnesses and some others connected to the criminal trial.\n\nJUDGE FINES TRUMP AGAIN FOR CONTEMPT, THREATENS JAIL TIME\n\nThe judge presiding over former President Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him an additional $1,000 for again violating a gag order barring him from making inflammatory comments about witnesses and jurors.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned on Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time.\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well,\" Merchan said. \"There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. Once the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nProsecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nThe judge had previously fined Trump $9,000 for nine earlier violations in posts on Truth Social and his website.\n\nTRUMP TALKS COLUMBIA COMMENCEMENT CANCELLATION BEFORE COURT\n\nBefore heading into the courtroom Monday morning, Donald Trump spoke to reporters, relaying familiar complaints about the fairness of the trial, the judge and the gag order that stops him commenting on witnesses and jurors.\n\nHe also noted the breaking news that Columbia University canceled its main commencement following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests.\n\n\"That shouldn't happen,\" he said.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan as witness testimony in his hush money trial enters its third week.\n\nWHO'S BEEN ONTHE STAND SO FAR\n\nWitness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial is entering its third week on Monday and it remains to be seen who will take the stand next.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, jurors have heard from a host of different people.\n\nFollowing a weeklong jury selection process that began mid-April, jurors heard first from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who among other things explained his pledge to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nFormer White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks on Friday painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nTHE WITNESS HEARD, BUT NOT YET SEEN\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nTRUMP EXPECTED IN COURT AS TRIAL ENTERS 12TH DAY\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case. A second contempt hearing was held on Thursday over four more prospective violations, but Merchan did not immediately issue a decision.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Davidson, who played an important role in the $130,00 payment to Daniels at the heart of the prosecution's case, failed to deflect much of Bove's line of questioning, appearing dodgy when he said he \"could not recall\" the answers only to be forced to reckon with his own words when instructed to listen to recorded audio of the conversations.\n\nThe day featured the name-dropping of multiple celebrities -- including Charlie Sheen and Tila Tequila -- as Bove endeavored to prove non-disclosure agreements were a routine part of Davidson's work and underscored the witness' questionable ethics. Bove pressed Davison on whether he represented clients to \"extract\" settlements from celebrities; Davidson took issue with the word.\n\n\"We're both lawyers,\" Bove told Davidson. \"I'm not here to play lawyer games with you.\"\n\nDavidson wrangled over words with the prosecution, too. When questioned by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass on how the statements he crafted for Stormy Daniels' denying the affair following reports of the payment in 2018 could be \"technically true,\" Davidson said a strict reading would be true.\n\n\"I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that any interactions between she and Mr. Trump was romantic,\" Davidson said, keying in on the last word to distinguish it from a \"sexual encounter.\"\n\nOn a similar question about how denying a \"sexual relationship\" was true, Davidson noted it was never alleged that they had a \"relationship.\"\n\nDavidson said he would not use the term \"hush money\" to describe the payment to Daniels and would rather call it \"consideration\" in a civil settlement. Several media outlets have published stories with headlines that continue to refer to the trial as a \"hush money\" case.\n\nAnother key point came when Bove asked Davidson if he recalled saying Stormy Daniels had \"settler's remorse\" or ever used the word \"leverage\" in a conversation with Cohen. Davidson was asked to listen to portions of the conversation -- which Cohen had recorded without his knowledge at the time -- after he said he could not recall the details.\n\nA grand jury indicted Trump in March 2023 on 34 felony counts for allegedly falsifying business records related to a payment made to keep Daniels quiet about her claims of a sexual encounter. Prosecutors are seeking to demonstrate Trump falsified the records in service of a broader \"conspiracy\" to interfere with the 2016 election.\n\nBove's questioning of Davidson suggested an alternate explanation to the Daniels' payment: Trump was another victim of the attorney's extortion efforts.\n\nIn the course of his testimony, Davidson also managed to cast even greater doubt on the already doubtful trustworthiness of the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen, who he said could be a \"very aggressive guy.\" Stories recounted by Davidson made Cohen appear unstable, such as one expletive-laced phone call Davidson says he received from Cohen after the 2016 election airing frustration about not landing a place in the Trump administration.\n\n\"'I've saved that guy's ass so many times, you don't even know,\" Davidson recalled Cohen saying.\n\nCohen had been gunning for a position as high as attorney general, Davidson later said, noting he thought Cohen was \"going to kill himself\" after that call.\n\nAt the end of his cross-examination, Bove pointed to the signatures page of the agreement with Daniels, highlighting the fact that Davidson never saw a version signed by \"David Dennison,\" Trump's pseudonym.\n\nThe tenth day of the trial, which began with another hearing on four new alleged violations of Trump's gag order, concluded with the introduction of a new witness, Douglas Daus, an analyst in the High Technology Analysis Unit at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\n\nDaus, who analyzed two of Cohen's cell phones, took the stand to explain the technicalities of extracting data from Cohen's phone. On cross-examination, Bove aimed his questions at the integrity of the evidence. Daus is expected to resume his testimony on Friday.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

The former attorney however received a big setback after learning that he wouldn't be part of the Trump administration. Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniel's attorney testified during the ongoing hush money trial. Davidson also alleged that he was \"concerned\" about Cohen's well-being after the self-described \"fixer\" announced he wasn't selected to be Trump's chief of staff or attorney general over the phone. \"Can you f****** believe I'm not going to Washington after everything I've done for that f****** guy?\", Cohen told Davidson over the recorded call. \"I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's a** so many times you don't even know,\" Cohen said referring to Trump. Davidson confessed that he feared Cohen would \"kill himself\" over the political snub.\n\nAs per The Daily Mail, in addition, Davidson defended Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who alleged to have an affair with Trump. Following the election, Cohen phoned the juror \"fairly frequently,\" according to the defense attorney. Cohen seemed \"very despondent and saddened\" when he called him one Saturday morning in mid-December. Davidson said: \"He was calling me and he told me he was depressed, he used very colorful language about that stage of his life.\" Emil Bove, Trump's attorney, questioned Davidson over his chat with Cohen in December 2016. After Trump's former attorney hung up the phone, Bove inquired as to whether Davidson was \"concerned\" for his well-being. Davidson said: \"I thought he was going to kill himself\".\n\nBove cross-examined Davidson if Cohen believed he would end up leading Trump's staff in the White House? In response, Davidson said that this employment was \"among others.\" Bove questioned whether Cohen ever considered becoming Attorney General. To which Davidson replied: \"That's true.\" As per The Independent, the adult film star's narrative of an alleged affair with Trump was kept out of the news throughout his campaign, according to texts and emails between Davidson and Cohen that were revealed in court between 2016 and the first two years of the Trump administration.\n\nThe former president is accused of 34 counts of manipulating company records, claiming to have reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payments by classifying them as legal expenditures. This transaction is at the core of the criminal case against him. According to messages presented in court, Cohen instructed Davidson to \"write a strong denial\" in January 2018, two days before The Wall Street Journal revealed specifics of the alleged hush money plot involving Daniels. When Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass questioned Davidson about Cohen's meaning of \"denial,\" Davidson replied, \"Everything.\" \"Including the sexual encounter with Donald Trump?\" Steinglass asked. \"Yes,\" Davidson confessed.\n\nDavidson also stated that Cohen threatened to sue him \"many times\" \"He can be a very aggressive guy, aggressive in his pursuits to protect his client, and he would often times make legal threats - 'bankrupt her' and 'rain legal hell on her.' 'Don't f*** with us.' 'You don't know who you're f****** with.' Things like that,\" he said. \"He wanted her to deny her story to protect his client.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Davidson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/691401/uploads/66225290-094a-11ef-b459-afce29d84ed7_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-12-", "textStart": 1480, "textEnd": 1493}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 2598, "textEnd": 2610}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

It also has some unique terminology.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nHUSH MONEY\n\nDEFINITION: According to Merriam-Webster, it's money paid so that someone will keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nEXAMPLE: Three payments that prosecutors say were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 that Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a federal campaign violation, among other unrelated crimes. The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., entered into a nonprosecution agreement in exchange for its cooperation with prosecutors. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, declaring that the McDougal deal was a \"prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.\"\n\n'CATCH AND KILL'\n\nDEFINITION: As prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement, \"catch-and-kill\" is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.\" A nondisclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing. But sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he agreed, at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner.\"\n\nPecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same \"catch and kill\" methods, including actor and ex-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and golfer Tiger Woods. Pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help a friend or further his business interests, but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else, like agreeing to an interview or posing for a magazine cover.\n\nFALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS\n\nDEFINITION: This is the criminal charge that's being decided at Trump's New York trial. He is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. It is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee Trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder New York law, a person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes a false entry to be made in a company's business records and does so with an intent to defraud, including intent to commit or hide another crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks. Prosecutors argue Trump's actions were a way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations. His lawyers have said the payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal expenses.\n\nCONSPIRACY\n\nDEFINITION: Trump isn't charged with the crime of conspiracy, but prosecutors at his New York trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his \"eyes and ears\" agreement with Pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement.\" Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Colangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election.\" To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must show that he had intent to commit another crime. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said in court that one of the crimes Trump intended to commit was a violation of a New York election law -- a misdemeanor involving a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nDEFINITION: Any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of a race.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost Trump's chances in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only was the National Enquirer acting as the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed, Pecker testified that the tabloid, at Cohen's behest, printed stories that tarred Trump's opponents. It also published stories that boosted Trump's image.\n\nIt's a different kind of election interference allegation from what Trump is charged with in his Washington and Georgia cases, where he's accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Trump claims that being put on trial while he's campaigning as this year's presumptive Republican nominee is its own form of election interference.\n\nGAG ORDER\n\nDEFINITION: Generally speaking, a gag order is \"a judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case,\" according to Merriam-Webster. In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nEXAMPLE: Judge Juan M. Merchan, acting on a request from prosecutors, imposed a limited gag order on Trump on March 26. It bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case. It also prohibits comments about jurors, prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court's staff, prosecution team or their families.\n\nMerchan expanded the order on April 1, barring Trump from commenting about his family or Bragg's family. The change came after Trump assailed the judge's daughter and made false claims about her on social media.\n\nLast Tuesday, Trump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan lamented that $1,000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing Trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president.\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism, including from witnesses like Cohen and Daniels, and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid a crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy.\n\nFollow Sisak at x.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips\n\nMore from this section\n\nMore than 2,100 people have been arrested during pro-Palestinian protests on US college campuses Arizona's Democratic governor signs a bill to repeal 1864 ban on most abortions Striking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@kulr8.com", "name": "Michael R.

SISAKMay 5, 2024 at 2:13 PM\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's New York criminal trial is full of terms you don't typically hear in a courtroom.\n\nCentering on allegations Trump falsified his company's records to conceal the nature of hush money reimbursements, it's the first ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial. It also has some unique terminology.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nHUSH MONEY\n\nDEFINITION: According to Merriam-Webster, it's money paid so that someone will keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nEXAMPLE: Three payments that prosecutors say were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 that Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a federal campaign violation, among other unrelated crimes. The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., entered into a nonprosecution agreement in exchange for its cooperation with prosecutors. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, declaring that the McDougal deal was a \"prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.\"\n\n'CATCH AND KILL'\n\nDEFINITION: As prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement, \"catch-and-kill\" is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.\" A nondisclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing. But sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he agreed, at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner.\"\n\nPecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same \"catch and kill\" methods, including actor and ex-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and golfer Tiger Woods. Pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help a friend or further his business interests, but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else, like agreeing to an interview or posing for a magazine cover.\n\nFALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS\n\nDEFINITION: This is the criminal charge that's being decided at Trump's New York trial. He is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. It is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee Trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder New York law, a person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes a false entry to be made in a company's business records and does so with an intent to defraud, including intent to commit or hide another crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks. Prosecutors argue Trump's actions were a way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations. His lawyers have said the payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal expenses.\n\nCONSPIRACY\n\nDEFINITION: Trump isn't charged with the crime of conspiracy, but prosecutors at his New York trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his \"eyes and ears\" agreement with Pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement.\" Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Colangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election.\" To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must show that he had intent to commit another crime. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said in court that one of the crimes Trump intended to commit was a violation of a New York election law -- a misdemeanor involving a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nDEFINITION: Any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of a race.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost Trump's chances in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only was the National Enquirer acting as the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed, Pecker testified that the tabloid, at Cohen's behest, printed stories that tarred Trump's opponents. It also published stories that boosted Trump's image.\n\nIt's a different kind of election interference allegation from what Trump is charged with in his Washington and Georgia cases, where he's accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Trump claims that being put on trial while he's campaigning as this year's presumptive Republican nominee is its own form of election interference.\n\nGAG ORDER\n\nDEFINITION: Generally speaking, a gag order is \"a judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case,\" according to Merriam-Webster. In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nEXAMPLE: Judge Juan M. Merchan, acting on a request from prosecutors, imposed a limited gag order on Trump on March 26. It bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case. It also prohibits comments about jurors, prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court's staff, prosecution team or their families.\n\nMerchan expanded the order on April 1, barring Trump from commenting about his family or Bragg's family. The change came after Trump assailed the judge's daughter and made false claims about her on social media.\n\nLast Tuesday, Trump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan lamented that $1,000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing Trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president.\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism, including from witnesses like Cohen and Daniels, and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid a crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sisak at x.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_r_sisak@aol.com", "name": "Michael R.

These charges are the result of a lengthy investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and are linked to alleged payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to silence her about an alleged extramarital affair with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nProsecutors, led by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, are tasked with convincing the jury that Trump not only falsified business records related to hush money payments but also did so in furtherance of conspiracy to promote or prevent an election. While both falsifying business records and conspiracy charges are misdemeanors on their own, together they form the basis of a significant legal challenge for the defense.\n\nDuring the third week of the trial, the prosecution called several witnesses to the stand, including Keith Davidson, an attorney who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. Davidson's testimony shed light on the nature of the payments made to Daniels and emphasized technicalities surrounding her denial of an affair with Trump.\n\nAdditionally, the jury heard from Doug Daus, a computer forensic analyst for the DA's office, who testified about examining cellphones belonging to Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. An audio recording played during Daus' testimony captured Cohen discussing the transfer of information with another individual, potentially implicating further individuals in the case.\n\nTrump's defense team, led by attorneys Emil Bove and Todd Blanche, has vigorously cross-examined witnesses, attempting to challenge the prosecution's narrative and cast doubt on the evidence presented.\n\nAs the trial enters its next phase, all eyes are on the courtroom in New York City, where the legal battle surrounding one of the most high-profile cases in recent memory continues to unfold.", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportDomesticNews/tagreuters.com2024binary_LYNXNPEK3H0LC-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nOn the witness stand Thursday, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Keith Davidson, told jurors that it was easy to tell when Michael Cohen was recording their phone calls.\n\nCohen would suddenly sound \"very structured.\"\n\n\"Ordinarily, he was sort of all over the place,\" Davidson testified of Donald Trump's fixer-turned-nemesis.\n\nDavidson's surmise -- that Cohen was likely taping him at the time -- makes a pair of newly-released defense tapes all the more compelling and perplexing.\n\nThe tapes are from March of 2018. In them, the lawyer for then-President Trump chats with the former lawyer for a porn star.\n\nThey rehash old times: that hush-money deal they hammered out together days before the 2016 presidential election, a deal now at the center of Trump's ongoing criminal trial.\n\n\"Sometimes people get settler's remorse, you know?\" Davidson says on one tape, in what he hesitatingly admitted on the stand Thursday was a reference to Daniels.\n\n\"And other times, people think that, hey, I need to resolve this case before a date certain, because this is when I have the most\" Davidson says.\n\nIf Davidson really suspected he was being taped, that suspicion did not stop him from creating a record that, six years later, could damage not only his own credibility, but that of his porn star former client, and the prosecution.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has spent two weeks so far presenting a case that describes Trump as the mastermind of an election interference conspiracy.\n\nDaniels, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as signing the hush-money deal in fear for her life.\n\nShe wanted to create a paper trail linking her name to Trump's, she says in last month's documentary, \"so that he could not have me killed.\"\n\nThe tapes show the case, and Daniels, in a different light. They raise the question of whether Daniels' agent and Davidson, eager for cash, \"leveraged\" her story of a tryst with Trump in the crucial waning days of the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's side is already pushing an \"extortion\" theory, using much of their cross-examination of Davidson Thursday to grill him on his past hush-money cases involving celebrities and their scandals.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out and says, you know what, Stormy Daniels, she wanted this money more than you could ever imagine,\" Davidson says on another tape.\n\nDavidson said Thursday that he was talking about an upcoming TV interview, and was describing what he believed would be said during that interview by Anthony Kotzev, the then-boyfriend of Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez.\n\n\"I remember hearing her on the phone,\" Davidson says on tape, referring to Rodriguez.\n\n\"Saying, 'You fucking Keith Davidson. You better settle this goddamn story because if he loses this election -- and he is going to lose -- if he loses this election, we all lose all fucking leverage. This case is worth zero.\"\n\nDavidson was describing someone else's opinion, not necessarily his own. Still, as Davidson's angry words from 2018 played in the courtroom, they may have rang a bell that cannot be unrung in jurors' memories.\n\nUltimately, whether Trump was the victim or mastermind of the hush-money deal may prove immaterial.\n\nProsecutors say that throughout 2017, his first year in office, Trump falsified 34 business records, including nine checks to Cohen he signed personally.\n\nThe falsifications are felonies because they hid an unlawful conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, the District Attorney alleges.\n\nWhether Trump was playing Daniels or she was playing him -- or both, as is also possible -- has no bearing on the lawfulness of the documents themselves, prosecutors have argued.\n\n\"This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors at the start of last week, in the opening assertion of his opening statements.\n\nAnd while Colangelo told jurors that prosecutors will prove Trump \"orchestrated\" an election-influencing hush-money conspiracy, the charges do not require proof of who played whom.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_italiano@businessinsider.com", "name": "Laura Italiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cover-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6635064bec0c69656900d0c6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

As soon as the tape was disclosed in October 2016, Ms. Hicks said, she knew it would be \"a massive story.\"\n\nTaking the stand under a subpoena, Ms. Hicks said she was nervous, and at one point, early in the cross-examination, she broke down in tears.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney has charged Mr. Trump, 77, with falsifying 34 business records to hide a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who says she and Mr. Trump had a tryst in 2006 while he was married. Mr. Trump, the first American president to face criminal prosecution, has denied the charges and says he did not have sex with Ms. Daniels. If convicted, he could face probation or prison time.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's 11th day, and third week, on trial:\n\nMs. Hicks, now a communications consultant, testified to her fast rise in the Trump family orbit, going from working for his daughter Ivanka to press secretary for Mr. Trump's campaign. It was in that role that, in October 2016, she had to confront what she called the \"intense\" fallout from the revelation of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, has said the tape itself cannot be played, but jurors saw a transcript of it on Friday in an email sent to Ms. Hicks by a reporter from The Post.\n\n\"When you're a star, they let you do it,\" Mr. Trump said in the tape about groping women. \"You can do anything.\"\n\nThe need for damage control did not abate, however, as Ms. Hicks was confronted with the story of Karen McDougal and a mention of Ms. Daniels in an article by The Wall Street Journal just days before the 2016 election. The story reported that Ms. McDougal, a former Playboy model, had been paid $150,000 in August 2016 by the parent company of The National Enquirer, which then suppressed her story of an affair with Mr. Trump which he has denied.\n\nMs. Hicks recalled consulting with Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer and fixer, who eventually paid Ms. Daniels to keep quiet. Mr. Cohen denied the stories, drafting a proposed response calling them \"completely untrue,\" and Ms. Hicks told The Journal the same thing.\n\nIndeed, even as the \"Access Hollywood\" tape was coming out, Ms. Hicks said one strategy -- which she documented in an email to other senior Trump aides -- was simple: \"Deny, deny, deny.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, Keith Davidson, a Los Angeles lawyer, testified about deals he negotiated for Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal during the closing months of the 2016 campaign, when Mr. Trump was battling Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe election was a constant topic, with Mr. Davidson pressuring Mr. Cohen for payment as Election Day loomed and Ms. Daniels threatening to blow up the deal as days ticked down.\n\nOn Friday, prosecutors introduced online postings and a video statement by Mr. Trump in which he acknowledged saying \"foolish things\" on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, but also attacking Ms. Clinton. The jury also saw posts made in the weeks before the election in which Mr. Trump blasted women who had accused him of misconduct, calling their accounts phony.\n\n\"Nobody has more respect for women than me,\" he wrote.\n\nProsecutors on Tuesday played video clips of Mr. Trump's denials of sexual assault while on the campaign trail, as well as part of a deposition Mr. Trump gave in a lawsuit in which he was found liable for sexual abuse.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Mr. Trump blasted the criminal case while campaigning, calling Justice Merchan \"crooked\" and \"conflicted.\"\n\nBack in court on Thursday, jurors heard a conversation Mr. Cohen had recorded with Mr. Trump about how to reimburse the publisher of The Enquirer for the purchase of Ms. McDougal's story.\n\nAfter hearing prosecutors' arguments last week over violations of a gag order barring attacks on trial participants, Justice Merchan on Tuesday fined Mr. Trump $9,000 and threatened him with jail if they continue.\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutors presented four more incidents and called Mr. Trump's statements \"corrosive.\" Mr. Trump's legal team argued that he was merely responding to political attacks.\n\nJustice Merchan has not yet ruled, but a decision could come soon, perhaps next week.

Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the 2024 election, has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to all 34 charges against him in the case.\n\nWhile testifying on Thursday, Davidson, who represented Daniels at the time of the alleged payment, explained an email sent to National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard in which he wrote, \"What have we done?\" Prosecutors asked him to elaborate on what he meant in that email.\n\n\"Our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump,\" Davidson responded.\n\nKirschner, a former assistant U.S. attorney and frequent Trump critic, called the testimony \"breathtaking.\"\n\n\"That was a bit of testimony that was pretty breathtaking,\" Kirschner said, \"and it actually undercuts one of the defense assertions that they're trying to use to wiggle out of Trump's criminal responsibility for this.\"\n\n\"What Keith Davidson testified to is that he was engaged in this hush-money payment and covering these things up and then come election night, or the next day when it looks like Donald Trump was going to win the election, Keith Davidson said: 'Oh my God, what did we do?' And the import of that is really twofold. One, they recognized the potentially dramatic damage they had done to the country by engaging in conduct that may have actually facilitated Donald Trump getting elected.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's clear that Keith Davidson and the others involved in this scheme knew that these hush-money payments were being made to impact the election, not to try to conceal information from Melania or Donald Trump's family because they would not have woken up on election morning, the day after the election realized Donald Trump won and said, 'Oh my god, what did we do?' if this was all about Donald Trump not wanting Melania to learn about his dalliances.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dave Aronberg, the state attorney in Florida's Palm Beach County, told Newsweek on Thursday that his testimony is a \"powerful piece of evidence\" because it shows the alleged \"hush-money scheme was intended to help Trump get elected president.\"\n\n\"This is important because a campaign finance violation would elevate the misdemeanor charges of falsification of business records into felonies,\" Aronberg said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors":

She didn't answer. They say they are running story & have a deadline of tonight for her to comment,\" Davidson texted Cohen on January 10, 2018, two days before the story was published, the messages show.\n\nCohen quickly replied: \"Write a strong denial comment for her like you did before.\"\n\n'This is no good'\n\nDays after the hush-money story broke, Cohen messaged Davidson to say he had Daniels -- whose real name is Stephanie Clifford -- scheduled to appear \"tonight\" on Sean Hannity's Fox News show.\n\nDavidson responded that she couldn't do it that day.\n\n\"She is flying to LA tomorrow. I'm trying to get her to commit for tomorrow,\" Davidson texted.\n\nCohen responded, \"It's really important. Why?\" and begged for Davidson to call him.\n\n\"This is no good. We need her as by doing tomorrow you just create another news cycle instead of putting an end to this one,\" Cohen wrote.\n\nMinutes later Cohen texted Davidson, \"Please call me,\" before he again texted, \"Cmon!\"\n\n\"Let's forget tonight. They would rather tomorrow so they can promote the heck out of the show,\" Cohen messaged Davidson about a half-hour later.\n\nMessages show Cohen's 'pants on fire stages'\n\nMore than two hours later, Cohen backtracked, messaging Davidson, \"The wise men all believe the story is dying and don't think it's smart for her to do any interviews. Let her do her thing but no interviews at all with anyone.\"\n\nDavidson then replied, \"100%.\"\n\n\"Thanks pal,\" Cohen messaged back, adding, \"Just no interviews or statements unless through you.\"\n\nIn Davidson's testimony Thursday about the text messages regarding Daniels potentially appearing on Hannity's show, he said, \"This was sort of in one of Michael Cohen's pants on fire' stages, where he was sort of frantically trying to address the fact that Stormy's story had percolated into public consumption and he -- he was frantic.\"\n\n\"I was in a trial and -- which is fairly all-consuming -- and it was just many, many, many phone calls and many, many text messages with little regard for my schedule,\" Davidson told the jury.\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Cohen thought if Daniels went on Hannity's show, it \"would somehow help him and his client.\"\n\n\"I had an understanding that he believed that she would further deny the interaction,\" Davidson told the jury.\n\nDaniels initially denied an affair with Trump, including in written statements issued to the media after the hush-money story broke. But months later, she said she did, in fact, have sex with the then-\"Apprentice\" star in 2006.\n\nProsecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office say Cohen made the election-influencing hush-money payment to Daniels on Trump's behalf to buy her silence about the affair she had with him -- and that Trump lied on documents to cover up his reimbursements to Cohen.\n\nTrump, who faces 34 felony counts alleging falsifying business records, has repeatedly denied having an affair with Daniels.\n\n'Why is she going on Kimmel after the Sotu'\n\nThe text messages between Cohen and Davidson also show the internal chaos that ensued before and after Daniels appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on January 30, 2018, following Trump's State of the Union address.\n\n\"Why is she going on Kimmel after the Sotu,\" Cohen texted Davidson days earlier. Davidson replied, \"Idk I was pissed. She said this is her shot. I'm meeting with her this weekend to prep her and get the statement.\"\n\nDuring Daniels' interview with Jimmy Kimmel, she suggested that her signature under a statement denying she had an affair with Trump had been forged.\n\n\"She just denied the letter,\" Cohen texted Davidson at the time. \"Claiming it's not her signature.\"\n\n\"You said she did it in front of you,\" Cohen added. Davidson responded, \"She did. Impossible - she posted it on her own twitter page.\"\n\nCohen then texted, \"They showed her signature and she claimed it was not hers on Kimmel.\"\n\n\"Wtf,\" Davidson replied.\n\nCohen messaged minutes later, \"The press is already beginning to send me e-mails.\"\n\nShortly after, Cohen texted Davidson to \"please tell\" Daniels' then-manager Gina Rodriguez \"to ensure\" Daniels \"responds the same as your statement tomorrow when she does the view.\"\n\n\"This is not a comedy show!\" Cohen fumed.\n\n\"Gina is ticked off at stormy because stormy made her look like a liar,\" Davidson told Cohen, referring to Daniels' agent. \"Gina says she is going to have a LONG talk with stormy on the plane to NY tomorrow. She assured me this will get handled.\"\n\nDavidson testified Thursday that Daniels signed the widely-circulated statement denying an affair with Trump, but that he wrote the statement himself.\n\nThe lawyer also testified that \"an extremely strict reading of this statement would technically be true.\"\n\n\"I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic,\" Davidson said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors":

Merchan fined the former president $1,000 and warned that going forward, additional violations could result in jail time. Prosecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nWitness testimony resumed following Merchan's ruling, with former Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney taking the stand -- setting the stage for an even deeper dive into the events and people involved in what prosecutors have said was a scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election by buying and burying negative stories about the then-candidate.\n\nThe trial is in its 12th day.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Hope Hicks took the stand last week, recounting how Trump's campaign was turned upside-down following the leak of a video wherein he bragged about grabbing women without their permission.\n\nKeith Davidson, who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. Davidson spent hours detailing his role in securing payouts for Daniels and McDougal in exchange for their silence about previous sexual encounters they said they had with Trump.\n\nOverall, prosecutors are setting the stage for pivotal testimony from Michael Cohen, who paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence before he went to prison for the hush money scheme.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records to cover up hush money payments -- including the payment to Daniels -- recording them instead as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nAs prosecutors in Donald Trump's hush money trial shifted their questions to the subject of Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, Jeffrey McConney, like multiple witnesses before him, didn't seem to be a fan.\n\nAsked if he was familiar with the former Trump fixer, McConney paused briefly, before adding: \"I've had conversations with him by the coffee machine.\"\n\nIn response to a question about Cohen's position within the Trump Organization, McConney responded dryly: \"He said he was a lawyer.\"\n\nFORMER EXEC RECALLS EARLY LESSON FROM TRUMP\n\nIn an anecdote from early in his career, former Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney testified in court about Donald Trump's close attention to his cash and hardball approach to bills.\n\nWhen he went to drop off a report on Trump's desk one day in the late 1980s, he said, the then-real estate mogul looked up while on the phone and said, \"Jeff, you're fired.\"\n\nMcConney was taken aback. Then Trump added, according to the ex-controller: \"You're not fired, but my cash balances went down from last week.\"\n\nMcConney said he explained that various expenses had come up. Trump responded that he should \"focus on my bills, negotiate my bills.\"\n\n\"It was a teaching moment,\" McConney recalled. \"If someone's asking for money, negotiate with them,\" rather than just paying.\n\nFrom the defense table, the former president appeared to enjoy hearing the story, lifting his chin and smiling broadly in McConney's direction.\n\nSTUDENTS WATCH TRIAL FROM OVERFLOW ROOM\n\nPeople watching Donald Trump's hush money trial from the courthouse were joined in the overflow room Monday morning by a group of students from a Manhattan private school, who said they were given the morning off to attend.\n\n\"That's him!\" one of the high schoolers yelped earlier in the morning as Trump appeared on the video monitor. She was promptly shushed by one of her classmates.\n\nFORMER TRUMP ORGANIZATION CONTROLLER TAKES STAND\n\nFormer Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney took the stand Monday morning in Donald Trump's hush money case.\n\nMcConney worked for the company for more than three decades, retiring last year after he was granted immunity in exchange for testifying for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial. During that trial, he admitted breaking the law to help fellow executives avoid taxes on company-paid perks. The company was convicted and is appealing.\n\nMcConney, who left with $500,000 in severance, went on to testify tearfully last fall at the civil fraud trial of Trump, the company and key executives. The ex-controller said he'd been worn out by his entanglement in a litany of Trump-related investigations and legal proceedings.\n\n\"I just wanted to relax and stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I loved working for,\" he said at the time.\n\nTHE COMMENT THAT VIOLATED THE GAG ORDER\n\nThe judge in Donald Trump's hush money case found on Monday that Donald Trump had violated his gag order with comments he gave to a program called \"Just the News No Noise\" on April 22, which is broadcast on Real America's Voice.\n\nOn the program, the former president criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed it was stacked with Democrats. \"The jury was picked so fast. 95 percent Democrats. The area's mostly all Democrat,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Juan M. Merchan said the comments \"not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\n\n\"Defendant is hereby put on notice that if appropriate and warranted, future violations of its lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration,\" the judge wrote in the order.\n\nThe gag order bars Trump from making comments about the jurors, key witnesses and some others connected to the criminal trial.\n\nJUDGE FINES TRUMP AGAIN FOR CONTEMPT, THREATENS JAIL TIME\n\nThe judge presiding over former President Donald Trump's hush money trial has fined him an additional $1,000 for again violating a gag order barring him from making inflammatory comments about witnesses and jurors.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan warned on Monday that additional gag order violations could potentially result in jail time.\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well,\" Merchan said. \"There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. Once the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nProsecutors had accused Trump of four violations, but the judge only concurred with one.\n\nThe judge had previously fined Trump $9,000 for nine earlier violations in posts on Truth Social and his website.\n\nTRUMP TALKS COLUMBIA COMMENCEMENT CANCELLATION BEFORE COURT\n\nBefore heading into the courtroom Monday morning, Donald Trump spoke to reporters, relaying familiar complaints about the fairness of the trial, the judge and the gag order that stops him commenting on witnesses and jurors.\n\nHe also noted the breaking news that Columbia University canceled its main commencement following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the courthouse in lower Manhattan as witness testimony in his hush money trial enters its third week.\n\nWHO'S BEEN ONTHE STAND SO FAR\n\nWitness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial is entering its third week on Monday and it remains to be seen who will take the stand next.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, jurors have heard from a host of different people.\n\nFollowing a weeklong jury selection process that began mid-April, jurors heard first from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who among other things explained his pledge to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations, also took the stand. And jurors heard from others such as a forensic analyst who examined Michael Cohen's phones and a paralegal with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nFormer White House press secretary and ex-Trump adviser Hope Hicks on Friday painted a vivid picture of the chaos that unfolded after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked and the Wall Street Journal ran a story about McDougal's hush money deal.\n\nThe defense cross-examined Hicks for roughly 20 minutes before court adjourned early last Friday.\n\nTHE WITNESS HEARD, BUT NOT YET SEEN\n\nAlthough an ensemble of different people have testified in Donald Trump's hush money case over the past two weeks, one pivotal witness has been frequently heard but not yet seen: Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nJurors last week began hearing Cohen's words on audio recordings as prosecutors worked to directly tie Trump to payments to silence women with damaging claims about him before the 2016 election.\n\nJurors heard, in particular, a potentially crucial piece of evidence: a recording of Trump and Cohen, then his attorney, discussing a plan to pay off an ex-Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump. The former president denies the affair.\n\nThey also heard a few witnesses recount their interactions with Cohen -- some pleasant and others far less so.\n\nIt's unclear when the prosecution's star witness will take the stand.\n\nTRUMP EXPECTED IN COURT AS TRIAL ENTERS 12TH DAY\n\nDonald Trump is expected to return to Manhattan court as his hush money trial enters its 12th day.\n\nLast week's proceedings saw a frenzy of witnesses take the stand, including former Trump adviser Hope Hicks and Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations with Cohen and the National Enquirer.\n\nThe week also saw Trump fined $9,000 by Judge Juan M. Merchan for violating a gag order that bars the former president from speaking publicly about key witnesses, jurors and others in the case. A second contempt hearing was held on Thursday over four more prospective violations, but Merchan did not immediately issue a decision.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news",

No, seriously, this is not a joke. Michael Cohen will soon appear in a Manhattan courtroom in what is sure to be one of the most bizarre moments in legal history.\n\nCohen wraps almost the entire prosecution case against former President Donald Trump under a criminal theory that still leaves many of us perplexed. It's unclear exactly what crime Trump was allegedly trying to cover up by paying hush money to former porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nWhat is clear is that none of the witnesses called in recent weeks have had any direct connection to Trump over the payments.\n\nThe witnesses had a lot to say about Cohen, and most of them weren't good. They described an unprofessional, self-described \"fixer\" who created a shell company to buy Daniels out with his own money. The money was later repaid by Trump after the election, along with other legal fees.\n\nSo Cohen will now argue to the jury that he should put his former client in prison for following his own legal advice.\n\nThis would be difficult even for a competent and ethical lawyer. For Cohen, this is total madness. But Bragg is betting on a New York jury that will look no further than the identity of the defendant to convict.\n\nCohen has an impressive history of lies and exaggerations that may be unprecedented. Just a few weeks ago, another judge exposed him as a serial perjurer who was still gaming the system.\n\nHe's not the accused, mind you, but Alvin Bragg's star witness.\n\nI have been an open critic of Cohen since the days when he still represented Trump. His unethical actions were matched only by his unprofessional behavior.\n\nIn 2015, after Harvard Lampoon students played a harmless prank on Trump, Cohen was quoted by a student Lampoon staff as threatening them with expulsion.\n\nWhen a reporter approached a story that Cohen didn't like, he told him that he should \"use great caution because what I'm going to do to you is going to be really disgusting.\" Do you understand me?\"\n\nIt is not difficult to \"understand\" Cohen. He has long marketed his curious ability to willingly say whatever the highest bidder wants him to say.\n\nHe is a convicted perjurer who appears to lie even when the truth would do. Every time he is caught lying, he pretends to be the sinner who has finally seen the light and is seeking redemption.\n\nWhen he was called before the House to testify against Trump shortly after his plea deal with the Justice Department (for lying), Cohen was again charged with perjury. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Mary.) warned Cohen repeatedly that he had better tell the truth this time. Cohen then testified that Trump wanted him to work in his administration and offered him several jobs, which he declined. He also said: \"I have never asked for, and will never accept, a pardon from President Trump. \"\n\nMultiple sources said Cohen's lawyer requested a pardon from the White House and that Cohen unsuccessfully requested a presidential pardon after FBI searches of his office and residences last year.\n\nEven after being stripped of his law license and sentenced to three years in prison, Cohen continued on this path. In 2019, Cohen failed to appear to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, citing an inability to travel due to surgery. He was later seen partying before the court date with five friends.\n\nEven in prison, Cohen was accused of lying in court, in violation of an early release order due to medical issues. He was returned to custody after being spotted at an upscale restaurant.\n\nBut the most impressive moment came when Cohen was put back on the stand under oath and matter-of-factly asserted that he had lied at his previous hearing, when he pleaded guilty to lying.\n\nDuring his 2018 guilty plea before U.S. District Judge William Henry Pauley III, Cohen admitted to this conduct under oath.\n\nThen, when Trump's lawyer asked Cohen, \"Did you lie to Judge Pauley when you said you were guilty of the charges you said under oath you were guilty of?\" Did you lie to Judge Pauley?\n\nCohen replied, \"Yes.\" He was then asked again: \"So you lied when you told a judge under oath that you had evaded tax; Is that correct?\" He again replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nMost of us then expected the Justice Department to bring new perjury charges. It is rare for a defendant to take the stand and confess to perjury. However, Cohen was helpful again. This time he was ready to deliver Trump. The Justice Department and Manhattan prosecutors were clearly willing to tolerate a little perjury for that price.\n\nCohen's conduct has already played a significant role in legal proceedings in Manhattan. When Keith Davidson took the stand - the lawyer who represented both Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal - he recounted how furious Cohen was about not being offered a job at the White House. This directly contradicts Cohen's congressional testimony. Davidson said Cohen thought he could be named attorney general.\n\nThis account, if true, shows that Cohen is not only unethical, but also delusional. Cohen was found incapable of being a lawyer, much less an attorney general.\n\nAs prosecutors set the table for the official arrival of their star witness, the testimony only got worse. David Pecker, the former owner of the National Enquirer, charitably said that Cohen was \"prone to exaggeration.\"\n\nDavidson described Cohen's profane and unprofessional conduct, stating that \"the moral of the story is that no one wanted to talk to Cohen.\" This is perhaps the first time that the word \"moral\" has been used in the same sense as Cohen.\n\nFormer Trump associate Hope Hicks mocked Cohen on the stand. She said he was constantly trying to insinuate himself into the campaign, without success, and that he \"liked to be called Mister Fix It, but that was only because he broke it first.\"\n\nPlease note, these were his fellow prosecution witnesses, not the defense.\n\nThese witnesses also contradicted the basis of the accusation. Pecker said he killed stories for various celebrities for years and did it for Trump for more than a decade before running for office. Davidson said he did not view the deal as hush money, but simply a \"consideration\" designed to kill bad press.\n\nHicks said she believed Trump wanted to kill the stories largely to protect his family from embarrassment.\n\nCohen couldn't even maintain a consistent position during the trial. Many of us have denounced the silence imposed on Trump, which prevents him from responding to Cohen's incessant attacks in the media. Cohen then promised to cease further commenting. This promise may have set a record for Cohen. He kept it on for about three days before he was accused of trolling dollars on social media by attacking Trump.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bragg will now call this disbarred serial perjurer to make his case against a former president.\n\nUnder New York law, the oath administered by the court is supposed to \"awaken the conscience and impress the mind of the witness in accordance with his religious or ethical convictions.\"\n\nBefore the bailiff administers the oath to Cohen, Judge Juan Merchan may have to warn spectators in the courtroom not to laugh. To anyone who knows Cohen, this will sound like the ultimate punchline to a bad joke.\n\nJonathan Turley is the JB and Maurice C.

They are recordings of 2018 phone calls between the two lawyers who struck the 2016 hush-money deal. They suggest an alternate reality to the DA's -- where Trump is more victim than mastermind.\n\nOn the witness stand Thursday, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Keith Davidson, told jurors that it was easy to tell when Michael Cohen was recording their phone calls.\n\nCohen would suddenly sound \"very structured.\"\n\n\"Ordinarily, he was sort of all over the place,\" Davidson testified of Donald Trump's fixer-turned-nemesis.\n\nDavidson's surmise -- that Cohen was likely taping him at the time -- makes a pair of newly-released defense tapes all the more compelling and perplexing.\n\nThe tapes are from March of 2018. In them, the lawyer for then-President Trump chats with the former lawyer for a porn star.\n\nThey rehash old times: that hush-money deal they hammered out together days before the 2016 presidential election, a deal now at the center of Trump's ongoing criminal trial.\n\n\"Sometimes people get settler's remorse, you know?\" Davidson says on one tape, in what he hesitatingly admitted on the stand Thursday was a reference to Daniels.\n\n\"And other times, people think that, hey, I need to resolve this case before a date certain, because this is when I have the most\" Davidson says.\n\nIf Davidson really suspected he was being taped, that suspicion did not stop him from creating a record that, six years later, could damage not only his own credibility, but that of his porn star former client, and the prosecution.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has spent two weeks so far presenting a case that describes Trump as the mastermind of an election interference conspiracy.\n\nDaniels, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as signing the hush-money deal in fear for her life.\n\nShe wanted to create a paper trail linking her name to Trump's, she says in last month's documentary, \"so that he could not have me killed.\"\n\nThe tapes show the case, and Daniels, in a different light. They raise the question of whether Daniels' agent and Davidson, eager for cash, \"leveraged\" her story of a tryst with Trump in the crucial waning days of the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's side is already pushing an \"extortion\" theory, using much of their cross-examination of Davidson Thursday to grill him on his past hush-money cases involving celebrities and their scandals.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out and says, you know what, Stormy Daniels, she wanted this money more than you could ever imagine,\" Davidson says on another tape.\n\nDavidson said Thursday that he was talking about an upcoming TV interview, and was describing what he believed would be said during that interview by Anthony Kotzev, the then-boyfriend of Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez.\n\n\"I remember hearing her on the phone,\" Davidson says on tape, referring to Rodriguez.\n\n\"Saying, 'You fucking Keith Davidson. You better settle this goddamn story because if he loses this election -- and he is going to lose -- if he loses this election, we all lose all fucking leverage. This case is worth zero.\"\n\nDavidson was describing someone else's opinion, not necessarily his own. Still, as Davidson's angry words from 2018 played in the courtroom, they may have rang a bell that cannot be unrung in jurors' memories.\n\nUltimately, whether Trump was the victim or mastermind of the hush-money deal may prove immaterial.\n\nProsecutors say that throughout 2017, his first year in office, Trump falsified 34 business records, including nine checks to Cohen he signed personally.\n\nThe falsifications are felonies because they hid an unlawful conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, the District Attorney alleges.\n\nWhether Trump was playing Daniels or she was playing him -- or both, as is also possible -- has no bearing on the lawfulness of the documents themselves, prosecutors have argued.\n\n\"This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors at the start of last week, in the opening assertion of his opening statements.\n\nAnd while Colangelo told jurors that prosecutors will prove Trump \"orchestrated\" an election-influencing hush-money conspiracy, the charges do not require proof of who played whom.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri":

No, seriously, this is not a joke. Michael Cohen will soon appear in a Manhattan courtroom in what is sure to be one of the most bizarre moments in legal history.\n\nCohen nearly comprises the prosecution's entire case against former President Donald Trump under a criminal theory that still has many of us baffled. It is not clear what crime Trump was supposedly trying to conceal by making \"hush-money\" payments to former porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nWhat is clear is that none of the witnesses called in recent weeks has had any direct involvement with Trump on the payments.\n\nThe witnesses had a lot to say about Cohen, and most of it was not good. They described an unprofessional, self-proclaimed \"fix-it man\" who created a shell corporation to buy out Daniels with his own money. The money was later paid back by Trump after the election, with other legal expenses.\n\nSo Cohen will now make the pitch to the jury that they should put his former client in jail for following his own legal advice.\n\nThis would be difficult even for a competent and ethical lawyer. For Cohen, it is utter insanity. But Bragg is betting on a New York jury looking no further than the identity of the defendant to convict.\n\nCohen has an impressive history of lies and exaggerations that may be unparalleled. Just weeks ago, another judge denounced him as a serial perjurer who was still gaming the system.\n\nThis is not the defendant, mind you, but Alvin Bragg's star witness.\n\nI have been an outspoken critic of Cohen going back to when he was still representing Trump. His unethical acts were matched only by his unprofessional demeanor.\n\nIn 2015, after students on the Harvard Lampoon played a harmless prank on Trump, Cohen was quoted by a student on the Lampoon staff as threatening them with expulsion.\n\nWhen a journalist pursued a story Cohen did not like, he told the reporter that he should \"tread very f -- ing lightly because what I'm going to do to you is going to be f -- ing disgusting. Do you understand me?\"\n\nIt is not hard to \"understand\" Cohen. He has long marketed his curious skill of voluntarily saying whatever the highest bidder wants him to say.\n\nHe is a convicted perjurer who seems to lie even when the truth would do. Each time he is caught lying, he claims to be the sinner who has finally seen the light, seeking redemption.\n\nWhen he was called before the House to testify against Trump soon after his plea agreement with the Justice Department (for lying), Cohen was again accused of perjury. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), warned Cohen repeatedly that he had better tell the truth this time. Cohen then testified that Trump wanted him to work in his administration and offered him multiple jobs, which he turned down. He also claimed, \"I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump.\"\n\nMultiple sources have said that Cohen's lawyer pressed the White House for a pardon, and that Cohen unsuccessfully sought a presidential pardon after FBI raids on his office and residences last year.\n\nEven after being stripped of his law license and sentenced to three years in prison, Cohen continued the pattern. In 2019, Cohen failed to appear to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, citing an inability to travel due to surgery. He was then seen partying before the hearing date with five friends.\n\nEven while in jail, Cohen was accused of lying to a court, in violation of an order for early release due to medical problems. He was ordered back into custody after being spotted at a high-end restaurant.\n\nBut the most impressive moment came when Cohen was put back on the stand under oath and matter-of-factly claimed that he had lied in his prior hearing, when he pleaded guilty to lying.\n\nIn his 2018 guilty plea before U.S. District Judge William Henry Pauley III, Cohen admitted to this conduct under oath.\n\nThen, when Cohen was asked by Trump's counsel, \"Did you lie to Judge Pauley when you said that you were guilty of the counts that you said under oath that you were guilty of? Did you lie to Judge Pauley?\"\n\nCohen responded, \"Yes.\" He was then again asked \"So you lied when you said that you evaded taxes to a judge under oath; is that correct?\" He again responded, \"Yes.\"\n\nMost of us expected the Justice Department to bring new perjury charges at that point. It is rare that a defendant will actually take the stand and confess to perjury. However, Cohen was now useful again. This time, he was willing to deliver Trump. The Justice Department and Manhattan prosecutors were clearly willing to tolerate a little perjury for that prize.\n\nCohen's conduct has already loomed large in the Manhattan proceedings. When Keith Davidson took the stand -- the attorney who represented both Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal -- he recounted how Cohen was furious about not being offered a job in the White House. That directly contradicts Cohen's congressional testimony. Davidson said that Cohen believed he might be named attorney general.\n\nThe account, if true, shows that Cohen is not only unethical, but also delusional. Cohen was found incapable of being an attorney, let alone an attorney general.\n\nAs prosecutors set the table for the grand arrival of their star witness, the testimony only got worse. David Pecker, the former owner of the National Enquirer, said charitably that Cohen was \"prone to exaggeration.\"\n\nDavidson described Cohen's profane and unprofessional conduct, stating that \"the moral of the story is nobody wanted to talk to Cohen.\" That may be the first time the word \"moral\" was used in the same line with Cohen.\n\nFormer Trump associate Hope Hicks mocked Cohen on the stand. She said that he constantly tried to insinuate himself into the campaign, without success, and that he \"used to like to call himself Mister Fix It, but it was only because he first broke it.\"\n\nMind you, these were his fellow prosecution witnesses, not the defense.\n\nThese witnesses also contradicted the basis for the prosecution. Pecker said that he killed stories for various celebrities for years, and that he did so for Trump for over a decade before he ran for office. Davidson testified that he did not consider the deal to be \"hush money\" but simply \"consideration\" to kill bad press.\n\nHicks testified that she believed Trump wanted to kill the stories in significant part to protect his family from embarrassment.\n\nCohen could not even maintain a consistent position during the trial. Many of us have denounced the gag order on Trump that prevents him from responding to Cohen's unrelenting attacks in the media. Cohen then promised to stop any further comments. That promise may have set a record for Cohen. He kept it for roughly three days before being accused of trolling for dollars on social media by attacking Trump.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bragg will now call this disbarred, serial perjurer to make the case against a former president.\n\nUnder New York law, the oath administered by the court is supposed \"to awaken the conscience and impress the mind of the witness in accordance with that witness's religious or ethical beliefs.\"\n\nBefore the bailiff administers the oath to Cohen, Judge Juan Merchan may have to warn spectators in the courtroom not to laugh. For anyone familiar with Cohen, it will sound like the ultimate punchline to a bad joke.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

She didn't answer. They say they are running story & have a deadline of tonight for her to comment,\" Davidson texted Cohen on January 10, 2018, two days before the story was published, the messages show.\n\nCohen quickly replied: \"Write a strong denial comment for her like you did before.\"\n\n'This is no good'\n\nDays after the hush-money story broke, Cohen messaged Davidson to say he had Daniels -- whose real name is Stephanie Clifford -- scheduled to appear \"tonight\" on Sean Hannity's Fox News show.\n\nDavidson responded that she couldn't do it that day.\n\n\"She is flying to LA tomorrow. I'm trying to get her to commit for tomorrow,\" Davidson texted.\n\nCohen responded, \"It's really important. Why?\" and begged for Davidson to call him.\n\n\"This is no good. We need her as by doing tomorrow you just create another news cycle instead of putting an end to this one,\" Cohen wrote.\n\nMinutes later Cohen texted Davidson, \"Please call me,\" before he again texted, \"Cmon!\"\n\n\"Let's forget tonight. They would rather tomorrow so they can promote the heck out of the show,\" Cohen messaged Davidson about a half-hour later.\n\nMessages show Cohen's 'pants on fire stages'\n\nMore than two hours later, Cohen backtracked, messaging Davidson, \"The wise men all believe the story is dying and don't think it's smart for her to do any interviews. Let her do her thing but no interviews at all with anyone.\"\n\nDavidson then replied, \"100%.\"\n\n\"Thanks pal,\" Cohen messaged back, adding, \"Just no interviews or statements unless through you.\"\n\nIn Davidson's testimony Thursday about the text messages regarding Daniels potentially appearing on Hannity's show, he said, \"This was sort of in one of Michael Cohen's pants on fire' stages, where he was sort of frantically trying to address the fact that Stormy's story had percolated into public consumption and he -- he was frantic.\"\n\n\"I was in a trial and -- which is fairly all-consuming -- and it was just many, many, many phone calls and many, many text messages with little regard for my schedule,\" Davidson told the jury.\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Cohen thought if Daniels went on Hannity's show, it \"would somehow help him and his client.\"\n\n\"I had an understanding that he believed that she would further deny the interaction,\" Davidson told the jury.\n\nDaniels initially denied an affair with Trump, including in written statements issued to the media after the hush-money story broke. But months later, she said she did, in fact, have sex with the then-\"Apprentice\" star in 2006.\n\nProsecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office say Cohen made the election-influencing hush-money payment to Daniels on Trump's behalf to buy her silence about the affair she had with him -- and that Trump lied on documents to cover up his reimbursements to Cohen.\n\nTrump, who faces 34 felony counts alleging falsifying business records, has repeatedly denied having an affair with Daniels.\n\n'Why is she going on Kimmel after the Sotu'\n\nThe text messages between Cohen and Davidson also show the internal chaos that ensued before and after Daniels appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on January 30, 2018, following Trump's State of the Union address.\n\n\"Why is she going on Kimmel after the Sotu,\" Cohen texted Davidson days earlier. Davidson replied, \"Idk I was pissed. She said this is her shot. I'm meeting with her this weekend to prep her and get the statement.\"\n\nDuring Daniels' interview with Jimmy Kimmel, she suggested that her signature under a statement denying she had an affair with Trump had been forged.\n\n\"She just denied the letter,\" Cohen texted Davidson at the time. \"Claiming it's not her signature.\"\n\n\"You said she did it in front of you,\" Cohen added. Davidson responded, \"She did. Impossible - she posted it on her own twitter page.\"\n\nCohen then texted, \"They showed her signature and she claimed it was not hers on Kimmel.\"\n\n\"Wtf,\" Davidson replied.\n\nCohen messaged minutes later, \"The press is already beginning to send me e-mails.\"\n\nShortly after, Cohen texted Davidson to \"please tell\" Daniels' then-manager Gina Rodriguez \"to ensure\" Daniels \"responds the same as your statement tomorrow when she does the view.\"\n\n\"This is not a comedy show!\" Cohen fumed.\n\n\"Gina is ticked off at stormy because stormy made her look like a liar,\" Davidson told Cohen, referring to Daniels' agent. \"Gina says she is going to have a LONG talk with stormy on the plane to NY tomorrow. She assured me this will get handled.\"\n\nDavidson testified Thursday that Daniels signed the widely-circulated statement denying an affair with Trump, but that he wrote the statement himself.\n\nThe lawyer also testified that \"an extremely strict reading of this statement would technically be true.\"\n\n\"I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic,\" Davidson said.", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels",

There's no other way to put it.\n\nFor starters, Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the case, may have made a critical error that could reverse the Trump verdict upon appeal by allowing prosecutors to make certain arguments.\n\nAs I reported earlier, \"Last week, during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends,' GWU law professor Jonathan Turley told Fox News that Merchan made a mistake by allowing Bragg's prosecutorial team, which former Biden administration official Michael Colangelo is leading, to say unequivocally that Trump was involved in federal election law violations.\"\n\n\"That jury has now been told repeatedly that there are federal election crimes here, strongly suggesting that the payment to Stormy Daniels did violate federal election laws,\" Turley explained. \"That's just not true.\"\n\nHe cited the recent overturning of Harvey Weinstein's conviction for similar reasons as precedent.\n\nBut even the actual allegations against Trump are falling apart. Keith Davidson, the lawyer representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels, testified that the $130,000 payment to Daniels should not be construed as \"hush money\" but rather as a legitimate \"consideration\" payment. Davidson also testified that Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was \"despondent\" when he didn't get a White House job after Trump won the presidency in 2016.\n\nAnd then there was the testimony of former Trump aide Hope Hicks. Many in the media tried to paint her testimony as damning for Trump, but even she undermined the allegations against him.\n\nFox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett called Hicks' testimony an \"epic miscalculation\" by the prosecution. \"The moment cross-examination began, their misbegotten case against the former president began to collapse,\" he explained.\n\nHicks, who served as press secretary during the 2016 presidential campaign, explained that Trump's motive for suppressing salacious stories was to protect his wife, Melania. \"Absolutely...I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed about anything on the campaign. He wanted them to be proud of him.\"\n\nAccording to Jarrett, Hicks' account effectively dismantled Bragg's central accusation against Trump regarding the payment to Stormy Daniels. Rather than supporting the notion that Trump sought to unlawfully influence the election by paying for her silence, Hicks' testimony aligns well with federal investigations that found no evidence of criminal activity or violations of campaign finance laws. It underscores the existence of an alternative purpose for the non-disclosure agreement that Daniels signed.\n\nHicks also blasted Bragg's star witness, Michael Cohen.\n\n\"He used to like to call himself Mr. Fix-It, but it was only because he first broke it,\" she testified.\n\n\"It was foolhardy for Bragg's legal team to call Hicks,\" Jarrett observed. \"A rank amateurish mistake.\"\n\nJarrett continued, \"Her testimony was redundant and unnecessary. But under the theory that no dead horse will be left unbeaten, prosecutors seemed determined to have her tell the jury what they already knew.\"\n\nWith Hicks on the stand, prosecutors dwelled interminably on the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape. It has no bearing on the case, mind you, except to smear Trump with irrelevant and prejudicial information. Merchan's ruling to permit it as admissible evidence is a reversible error, just as it proved to be in the recently dismissed sex crimes conviction of Harvey Weinstein.\n\nBetween Merchan's mistakes and the testimony that has completely destroyed Bragg's case, the jury should easily decide in Trump's favor. Of course, this is no ordinary trial.

He faces 34 counts related to \"falsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election.\"\n\nProsecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records with the intent to commit or conceal another crime, but they don't have to prove that Trump committed that crime. The prosecution theory is that the second crime could be in violation of federal and state election laws or state tax laws regarding how the reimbursements to Michael Cohen were handled.\n\nTrump's attorneys have kept their defense close to the vest, but in court filings they've indicated that they plan to attack the credibility of Cohen and Stormy Daniels and paint them as liars who are motivated by grudges and money.\n\nTrump's legal team is led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, two former federal prosecutors from New York, and Susan Necheles, a veteran criminal defense lawyer with deep experience in New York and before Judge Juan Merchan. Necheles represented Trump's business at its tax fraud trial in 2022. The company was convicted.\n\nOutside lawyers who have been following the case closely say Trump is likely to argue that hush money payments are legal and distance the former president from the repayment scheme and bookkeeping handled by his trusted employees. They may also argue the payments were made to prevent embarrassment to Trump's family and not to influence the election. Trump could also testify in his own defense. He has testified in two recent civil trials, after regretting not taking the stand in a prior civil trial, but the stakes are higher in a criminal case.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_del_valle@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Lauren Del Valle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240503094324-01-donald-trump-hush-money-trial-050324-super-tease.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

More like Trump 20-24 years,\" Mr Cohen declared to thousands watching his livestream recently.\n\nAs he awaits his turn to take the stand, Mr Cohen has held almost nightly live streams on the video-sharing app TikTok, discussing Mr Trump and the ongoing \"hush money\" trial.\n\n\"The other day Donald once again... comes out of the courtroom and goes right into that little cage, which is where he belongs, in a f--king cage like an animal,\" he said.\n\nIn 2018, Mr Cohen switched from staunch ally to testifying to some of Mr Trump's most scandalous accusations.\n\nThe list includes his alleged inflation of the Trump Organization's real estate portfolio to garner bank loans, orchestrating \"hush money\" payments during the run-up to the 2016 election to women who claimed to have had affairs with him, and conspiring with Russia.\n\nOne video shared on Mr Cohen's TikTok account showed a cartoon of Mr Trump posting bail. \"Do we take rubles?\" the cartoon Trump asks court payment officials.\n\nCohen claims to have orchestrated payments, on behalf of the former president, to the porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence on her alleged affair with Mr Trump. The claim led Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to indict Mr Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\nCohen's testimony is a crucial part of Mr Bragg's case.\n\nHe told a jury in 2016 that he worked alongside Mr Trump to issue payments to at least two women in 2016 to protect his public image during the presidential campaign.\n\n'A problem of credibility'\n\n\"Cohen's videos and comments are a problem for his credibility as a witness and therefore a problem for the prosecution,\" Professor David Schultz from the University of Minnesota Law School told The Telegraph.\n\n\"His comments will raise questions about his motive to testify and whether his testimony is truthful or profit-motivated, or for other reasons.\"\n\nProf Schulz added: \"Normally a witness would not do this and the prosecution would have asked the individual not to talk about the case.\n\n\"But here questions now can be asked if Cohen is trying impermissibly to impact the case or it contributes to the carnival atmosphere that feeds into the Trump narrative that this is all political. Cohen's behaviour runs the risk of mistrial or grounds for appeal.\"\n\nCohen, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion and violating campaign finance law in 2018, has developed a dedicated anti-Trump fanbase. Almost 300,000 users now follow Cohen on TikTok and viewers can regularly send him donations.\n\nThe nightly \"Michael Cohen Live Show\" is held at 10pm EST, when he invites fans, impressionists and comedians to contribute.\n\nIn the lead-up to Mr Trump's trial, Cohen's nightly streams made him the 25th most popular live streamer on TikTok.\n\nAt least one of these shows - which saw him fluctuate between personal attacks and making heart shapes with his hands - garnered millions of likes.\n\n\"Join me under the big top tonight at 10 PM EDT for the circus you won't want to miss,\" he wrote in text overlaying the video as a computer-generated cowboy hat sat atop his head.\n\nBefore the trial, Cohen also live-streamed with another TikTok user who had generated a following by impersonating Mr Trump.\n\n\"I'm going to go to jail and it's going to be okay,\" the user, known as ZPAC, said. \"And I'm going to do it in your honour, quite frankly.\"\n\nThis week Cohen also delved into how he saw the trial playing out following testimony from David Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher.\n\nMr Pecker testified that in the run-up to the 2016 election, he caught and killed stories that portrayed Mr Trump in a negative light as part of an agreement between him, Mr Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"From everything that I heard from people today, well, David Pecker is basically corroborating what I have been saying for six years,\" Cohen said during a livestream.\n\n\"If I give my testimony and it corroborates his, well there you go, the circle starts closing.\"\n\nAnd on Tuesday night Cohen, dressed in a computer-generated knight's helmet, said: \"I'll go there with my helmet, my spear, and I'll sit my ass in that witness stand and I'll just tell the truth.\"", "source": {"uri":

They say they are running story & have a deadline of tonight for her to comment,\" Davidson texted Cohen on January 10, 2018, two days before the story was published, the messages show.\n\nCohen quickly replied: \"Write a strong denial comment for her like you did before.\"\n\nDays after the hush-money story broke, Cohen messaged Davidson to say he had Daniels -- whose real name is Stephanie Clifford -- scheduled to appear \"tonight\" on Sean Hannity's Fox News show.\n\nDavidson responded that she couldn't do it that day.\n\n\"She is flying to LA tomorrow. I'm trying to get her to commit for tomorrow,\" Davidson texted.\n\nCohen responded, \"It's really important. Why?\" and begged for Davidson to call him.\n\n\"This is no good. We need her as by doing tomorrow you just create another news cycle instead of putting an end to this one,\" Cohen wrote.\n\nMinutes later Cohen texted Davidson, \"Please call me,\" before he again texted, \"Cmon!\"\n\n\"Let's forget tonight. They would rather tomorrow so they can promote the heck out of the show,\" Cohen messaged Davidson about a half-hour later.\n\nMore than two hours later, Cohen backtracked, messaging Davidson, \"The wise men all believe the story is dying and don't think it's smart for her to do any interviews. Let her do her thing but no interviews at all with anyone.\"\n\nDavidson then replied, \"100%.\"\n\n\"Thanks pal,\" Cohen messaged back, adding, \"Just no interviews or statements unless through you.\"\n\nIn Davidson's testimony Thursday about the text messages regarding Daniels potentially appearing on Hannity's show, he said, \"This was sort of in one of Michael Cohen's pants on fire' stages, where he was sort of frantically trying to address the fact that Stormy's story had percolated into public consumption and he -- he was frantic.\"\n\n\"I was in a trial and -- which is fairly all-consuming -- and it was just many, many, many phone calls and many, many text messages with little regard for my schedule,\" Davidson told the jury.\n\nDavidson testified that he believed Cohen thought if Daniels went on Hannity's show, it \"would somehow help him and his client.\"\n\n\"I had an understanding that he believed that she would further deny the interaction,\" Davidson told the jury.\n\nDaniels initially denied an affair with Trump, including in written statements issued to the media after the hush-money story broke. But months later, she said she did, in fact, have sex with the then-\"Apprentice\" star in 2006.\n\nProsecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office say Cohen made the election-influencing hush-money payment to Daniels on Trump's behalf to buy her silence about the affair she had with him -- and that Trump lied on documents to cover up his reimbursements to Cohen.\n\nTrump, who faces 34 felony counts alleging falsifying business records, has repeatedly denied having an affair with Daniels.\n\nThe text messages between Cohen and Davidson also show the internal chaos that ensued before and after Daniels appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on January 30, 2018, following Trump's State of the Union address.\n\n\"Why is she going on Kimmel after the Sotu,\" Cohen texted Davidson days earlier. Davidson replied, \"Idk I was pissed. She said this is her shot. I'm meeting with her this weekend to prep her and get the statement.\"\n\nDuring Daniels' interview with Jimmy Kimmel, she suggested that her signature under a statement denying she had an affair with Trump had been forged.\n\n\"She just denied the letter,\" Cohen texted Davidson at the time. \"Claiming it's not her signature.\"\n\n\"You said she did it in front of you,\" Cohen added. Davidson responded, \"She did. Impossible - she posted it on her own twitter page.\"\n\nCohen then texted, \"They showed her signature and she claimed it was not hers on Kimmel.\"\n\n\"Wtf,\" Davidson replied.\n\nCohen messaged minutes later, \"The press is already beginning to send me e-mails.\"\n\nShortly after, Cohen texted Davidson to \"please tell\" Daniels' then-manager Gina Rodriguez \"to ensure\" Daniels \"responds the same as your statement tomorrow when she does the view.\"\n\n\"This is not a comedy show!\" Cohen fumed.\n\n\"Gina is ticked off at stormy because stormy made her look like a liar,\" Davidson told Cohen, referring to Daniels' agent. \"Gina says she is going to have a LONG talk with stormy on the plane to NY tomorrow. She assured me this will get handled.\"\n\nDavidson testified Thursday that Daniels signed the widely-circulated statement denying an affair with Trump, but that he wrote the statement himself.\n\nThe lawyer also testified that \"an extremely strict reading of this statement would technically be true.\"\n\n\"I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic,\" Davidson said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_musumeci@businessinsider.com", "name": "Natalie Musumeci", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Rodriguez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gina Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663551c210dfcda40966c322?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-10", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 736}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-30", "textStart": 3601, "textEnd": 3617}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 338, "textEnd": 350}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

"Trump lawyer suggests Hollywood attorney who brokered hush money deals was trading in extortion", "body": "MANHATTAN (CN) - One of Donald Trump's defense attorneys on Thursday afternoon accused the Los Angeles lawyer who wrote nondisclosure agreements for two women who say they had extramarital affairs with the former president of walking a fine line between legal settlements and illegal extortion threats.\n\nDuring tense cross-examination on the 10th day of the historic first criminal trial of a U.S. president, Trump's lawyer Emil Bove attempted to paint attorney Keith Davidson, who coordinated hush money payments with 2016 to bury rumors of Trump's trysts during his first presidential run, as a sleazy extortionist.\n\n\"What does the word 'extortion' mean to you,\" Bove asked Davidson.\n\n\"Extortion is the obtaining of property by fear or force,\" Davidson replied.\n\nBove, a former federal prosecutor in the nearby Southern District of New York, asked Davidson if he was careful to avoid \"making overt threats to the 2016 election\" in his carefully worded confidential settlement deals so that he would stay above board regarding extortion laws.\n\nBove asked Davidson if it was his opinion that any legal exposure he might face for extortion is now expired due to the statute of limitations.\n\nDavidson said he had not thought about it and had no opinion.\n\n\"You're a lawyer and you haven't thought of that, prior to your testimony?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"You were making a demand,\" Bove said. \"You were concerned about creating evidence of extortion, correct?\"\n\n\"You were concerned about linking those two issues - payment, election - in written communications,\" Bove prodded.\n\nTrump's lawyer pressed Davidson about a series of tawdry celebrity cases that he had negotiated settlement deals in over the years, including Hulk Hogan's sex tape case, Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, and 2000s reality television personality Tila Tequila.\n\nBove prodded Davidson about the details his work on those negotiations but he refused to disclose any details, citing attorney-client privilege after Bove repeatedly probed if he had \"extracted\" money from Sheen.\n\nBove prompted Davidson to explain that he had made a \"monetary demand\" to Terry Bollea, otherwise known as the wrestler Hulk Hogan, on behalf of clients who were in possession of a sex tape featuring the wrestler and Heather Cole, the former wife of shock jock and the wrestler's then-best friend Bubba \"the Love Sponge\" Clem.\n\n\"You had connections at TMZ at the time,\" Bove asked. \"Correct,\" Davidson responded.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" the witness affirmed after taking a beat to mull it over.\n\nManhattan prosecutors have accused Trump of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up his hush money payments to former pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and to Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal to silence them from going public about their respective affairs with Trump.\n\nDuring direct testimony earlier on Thursday, Davidson recalled receiving a call from a \"very despondent and saddened Michael Cohen\" in December 2016, during a the period of time after Trump had won the election but prior to being sworn in, fuming about how Trump was disregarding his then-loyal fixer/personal attorney while putting together in the incoming administration's cabinet.\n\n\"Jesus fucking Christ, I can't believe I'm not going to Washington,\" Davidson recalled Cohen saying on the call. \"I've saved that guy's ass so many times you don't even know.\"\n\n\"That fucking guy's not even paid me the $130,000 back,\" Davidson continued, recalling Cohen on the call, leading him to believe that Cohen had used his own money to buy Stormy Daniels' silence.\n\nDavidson's witness testimony concluded shortly before 3:30 on Thursday afternoon.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, attended Thursday's hearing, wearing a navy blue suit with marigold yellow-orange tie.\n\nThe next witness called after Davidson was a digital forensic evidence specialist.\n\nIn a separate civil lawsuit, model Karen McDougal sued Fox News in December 2019 for having defamed her a year earlier when the cable network's then-star Tucker Carlson falsely told his 2.8 million viewers that her story about a monthslong affair with President Donald Trump \"sounds like a classic case of extortion.\"\n\nMcDougal's defamation suit was thrown out the following year by U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil, who found Carlson's statements not actionable because Fox News viewers were expecting entertainment and not facts from Carlson.\n\nCarlson and Fox News parted ways in April 2023, shortly after the network agreed to pay $787.5 million to settle a defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the network's false claims in its coverage of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump's criminal trial in New York state court is expected to

SISAK - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's New York criminal trial is full of terms you don't typically hear in a courtroom.\n\nCentering on allegations Trump falsified his company's records to conceal the nature of hush money reimbursements, it's the first ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial. It also has some unique terminology.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nHUSH MONEY\n\nDEFINITION: According to Merriam-Webster, it's money paid so that someone will keep information secret. In other words, money that a person pays someone to hush up something.\n\nEXAMPLE: Three payments that prosecutors say were made on Trump's behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign. They are the National Enquirer's $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and the $130,000 that Trump's then-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen arranged to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nPeople are also reading... Sports anchor-reporter Heather Prusak exiting WIVB Tesla ending Supercharger work based at its Buffalo plant, report says Commission censures Judge Mark Grisanti for shoving Buffalo cop handcuffing his wife Man charged with criminal possession of weapon in connection with Zenner Street double homicide Mike Harrington: For now, Sabres need to forget about titles and get their Andy Dalton moment After fatal shootings, members of Buffalo's Bangladeshi community are angry, afraid Tops acquires five Perna-owned Tops franchise stores Lack of transparency over Bills PSL pricing upsets some season ticket holders Bills sign three free agents, including WR Chase Claypool National analysts weigh in on Buffalo Bills' draft class Fan suffers 'catastrophic' injury in Mohawk Place concert stage-diving incident 7 Sabres who can benefit from Lindy Ruff taking over as the Sabres' head coach Erie County, Buffalo moving forward on plans to spend $23.5M on affordable single-family homes Judge Mark Grisanti's neighbor disappointed his punishment wasn't tougher Uniform flap causes Buffalo wrestler to miss chance for Olympic spot\n\nPaying hush money isn't illegal on its own, but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about Trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a federal campaign violation, among other unrelated crimes. The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., entered into a nonprosecution agreement in exchange for its cooperation with prosecutors. The Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, declaring that the McDougal deal was a \"prohibited corporate in-kind contribution.\"\n\n'CATCH AND KILL'\n\nDEFINITION: As prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement, \"catch-and-kill\" is when a tabloid newspaper such as the National Enquirer \"buys up damaging information about someone, demands that the source sign a nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else, and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.\" A nondisclosure agreement is also known as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nEXAMPLE: Tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing. But sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that he agreed, at a Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Under the arrangement, Pecker said he would notify Cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about Trump so Trump's team could \"take them off the market or kill them in some manner.\"\n\nPecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same \"catch and kill\" methods, including actor and ex-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and golfer Tiger Woods. Pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help a friend or further his business interests, but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else, like agreeing to an interview or posing for a magazine cover.\n\nFALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS\n\nDEFINITION: This is the criminal charge that's being decided at Trump's New York trial. He is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. It is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee Trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder New York law, a person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes a false entry to be made in a company's business records and does so with an intent to defraud, including intent to commit or hide another crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege Trump misrepresented payments to Cohen in Trump's company records as legal fees when they were actually a reimbursement for the $130,000 that Cohen arranged to pay Daniels. The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks. Prosecutors argue Trump's actions were a way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it, including alleged election law violations. Trump denies the allegations. His lawyers have said the payments to Cohen were for legitimate legal expenses.\n\nCONSPIRACY\n\nDEFINITION: Trump isn't charged with the crime of conspiracy, but prosecutors at his New York trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his \"eyes and ears\" agreement with Pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, conspiring involves joining \"in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement.\" Under New York law, a conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit a crime.\n\nEXAMPLE: Colangelo, the prosecutor, said in his opening statement that Trump's trial involves \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election.\" To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must show that he had intent to commit another crime. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said in court that one of the crimes Trump intended to commit was a violation of a New York election law -- a misdemeanor involving a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.\n\nELECTION INTERFERENCE\n\nDEFINITION: Any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means, such as fraud, voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of a race.\n\nEXAMPLE: Prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved a concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost Trump's chances in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only was the National Enquirer acting as the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed, Pecker testified that the tabloid, at Cohen's behest, printed stories that tarred Trump's opponents. It also published stories that boosted Trump's image.\n\nIt's a different kind of election interference allegation from what Trump is charged with in his Washington and Georgia cases, where he's accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Trump claims that being put on trial while he's campaigning as this year's presumptive Republican nominee is its own form of election interference.\n\nGAG ORDER\n\nDEFINITION: Generally speaking, a gag order is \"a judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion (as by the press) of information related to a case,\" according to Merriam-Webster. In Trump's case, it's known as an Order Restricting Extrajudicial Statements, with extrajudicial meaning outside of court.\n\nEXAMPLE: Judge Juan M. Merchan, acting on a request from prosecutors, imposed a limited gag order on Trump on March 26. It bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case. It also prohibits comments about jurors, prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court's staff, prosecution team or their families.\n\nMerchan expanded the order on April 1, barring Trump from commenting about his family or Bragg's family. The change came after Trump assailed the judge's daughter and made false claims about her on social media.\n\nLast Tuesday, Trump was assessed a $9,000 fine -- $1,000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified. Prosecutors later requested an additional $4,000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order.\n\nMerchan lamented that $1,000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing Trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order, an unprecedented outcome for a former American president.\n\nTrump's lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism, including from witnesses like Cohen and Daniels, and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid a crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy.\n\nFollow Sisak at x.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump's own attorneys are reportedly afraid to leave him alone at the defense table or else he'll quickly doze off.\n\nBut on Friday afternoon, while his longtime sidekick Hope Hicks was on the stand spelling out his guilt, Trump wasn't asleep at all. By all accounts he was paying close attention to what she was saying. That doesn't mean he necessarily understood what she was saying or why it mattered or where he was. But he clearly knew who she was, and he presumably has strong feelings toward her, so he paid attention.\n\nOf course Trump's strong feelings toward Hicks are presumably positive, so he behaved. But what happens when someone else takes the stand who evokes just as strong of feelings in Trump, but negative ones?\n\nIn other words, what happens when Trump's former lovers like Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal take the stand? Will he remember that he had to pay these women off? Will he be angry at them? More to the point, what happens when Michael Cohen takes the stand? Trump has spent years publicly seething about how Cohen \"betrayed\" him.\n\nOnce emotionally meaningful witnesses like Cohen do take the stand, Trump will surely pay attention instead of sleeping. And what will Trump do? Will he start muttering things during the testimony? Will his lawyers be able to control him? Will the judge need to throw Trump in a cell while the testimony is playing out?\n\nThere are also people on social media who suspect that Trump keeps dozing off during the trial because his handlers are drugging him in order to make sure he behaves. There's no specific evidence of this. But if Trump is even sleepier during the witnesses he hates most, it would suggest that his handlers are drugging him even more thoroughly to try to prevent him from having confused angry outbursts.\n\nSo this will all be worth watching going forward. As bad as it is for Trump that he's slept through much of his trial so far, it might get even worse for him once we start getting to the witnesses that make him too angry to sleep.", "source": {"uri": "palmerreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palmer Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_palmer@palmerreport.com", "name": "Bill Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.palmerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/donald-trump-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

(Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump's lawyers famously spend a lot of their time placating their client's narcissistic delusions, even at the expense of their purported priority of keeping him out of prison. It's not just the over-the-top belligerence that Trump demands from his lawyers, which runs the risk of angering both the judge and the jury, Trump wants his lawyers to stick to his preposterous claims that he's never done anything wrong. He wants to pretend that he's the most perfect man who ever lived and that anyone who says otherwise has some secret agenda to victimize him.\n\nAs this trial goes on, the defense team has adopted Trump's favored tactic of floating conspiracy theories to explain away the mounting pile of evidence against him. In some cases, they may be trying to convince at least one juror the conspiracy theory is the same as reasonable doubt. But there appears to be another audience they're trying to reach: Trump's MAGA fans.\n\nMAGA has long relied on conspiracy theories to justify their odious political beliefs. For some reason, Trump seems to believe his followers need a story to tell to claim he's innocent of everything said about him during this trial, even though he very obviously isn't. So he's making his lawyers waste their time propagating the narrative instead of focusing their energies solely on the goal of confusing at least one juror to render a hung jury.\n\nBut Trump's supporters don't seem to be biting. MAGA may not love that their leader is on trial, but the conspiracy theories he's floating are so asinine that even his most shameless hype men are shying away from repeating them. It turns out there are conspiracy theories that are too dumb for even the Trump base to embrace. This disconnect also suggests that Trump's self-absorption is causing him to lose sight of what, exactly, his followers want from him.\n\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\n\nThe most obvious and frankly hilarious example: The defense team is sticking by Trump's story that he never had sex with Stormy Daniels. I can hear readers scoffing, but it's true, they're really going that route. Even in his opening statement, defense attorney Todd Blanche argued that Daniels' story is a \"false claim of a sexual encounter\" with Trump, one she made up as part of an extortion scheme.\n\nAs a defense strategy in court, this seems ill-advised. As anyone who has seen Daniels in an interview can attest, she comes across as a credible person. Certainly much more so than Trump, who lies and dissembles every waking moment of the day. But also, it just doesn't make sense. As no other than Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters recently, \"You don't pay someone $130,000 not to have sex with you.\" Plus, Trump's-then attorney (now turned state's witness) Michael Cohen was threatening Daniels to shut up years before the pay-off scheme, which wouldn't have been true if she made it all up to extort a presidential candidate in 2016. Plus, there's the other mistress, Karen McDougal, helping establish that Trump was not averse to adultery.\n\nTelling such an obvious whopper to a jury seems like it will backfire by making them believe the defense attorneys are just liars. Trump's claims of sexual virtue seem more aimed at the outside audience, as if he hopes his supporters will start parroting his ridiculous notions that he's never done anything wrong. There were a couple of half-baked efforts to do this. The far-right network OAN even tried to float the conspiracy theory that it was Cohen, not Trump, who had sex with Daniels -- but they were quickly forced to retract the story and apologize to Cohen. That's highly unusual for the network, which seems to exist primarily to spread right-wing disinformation. Part of this is because Cohen threatened to sue. But OAN didn't even bother to put up a fight. It suggests that even the folks at OAN are a bit embarrassed by this.\n\nTrump's lawyers are leaning into the narrative that he is a perfect angel who just keeps being targeted by vast conspiracies. During the cross-examination of lawyer Keith Davidson, who represented Daniels as Trump and Cohen paid her hush money, Trump attorney Emil Bove kept pushing the \"extortion\" conspiracy theory. He appeared to be arguing that Daniels and Davidson had concocted a shakedown scheme. But it doesn't pass the basic common sense test to argue that Trump would be so threatened by a false story that he'd pay her this much money.\n\nThings got even sillier on Thursday when Bove questioned forensics expert Douglas Daus. Daus was just there to verify that text messages and recordings from Cohen's phone were real. But Bove tore into the guy, repeatedly suggesting the information extracted from the phone was compromised or fabricated in some way as if the texts and recordings were the product of a \"deep state\" conspiracy. It's hard to imagine this is for a jury made up of people who were screened to make sure they aren't QAnon-style nuts. Likelier is the hope that this conspiracy theory will get traction in the right-wing propaganda machine, feeding Trump followers talking points they can use to dismiss it if the jury convicts.\n\nBut what's fascinating is that the MAGA media doesn't seem to be biting. Instead of trying to discredit the allegations against Trump, the right-wing press has gone with a deflect-and-distract strategy. As Media Matters chronicled, Fox News is doing lots of \"look over there!\"-style segments making a big deal out of Trump's press events at bodegas, rather than grappling with what's going on inside the courtroom. The network is also pushing the idea that Trump should get \"immunity\" for all his crimes, which feels like a tacit admission of guilt. Even those who are trying to get conspiracy theories going, like Steve Bannon at War Room, are focused on attacking the prosecutors for having \"political\" motivations. Denying the truth of the allegations is not a priority, because even the MAGA audiences won't buy it.\n\nIn the past, Trump has clearly understood that even his supporters don't buy the idea that he's a good person. If anything, his transgressions, both legal and criminal, are part of his appeal. He's an aspirational figure to people who wish they could also cheat on their wives and commit crimes, all without facing consequences. While they do have an astounding amount of tolerance for his endless whining, his appeal was never his \"woe is me\" victim act, but his impunity.\n\nIt also shows he forgets what his supporters want from him: A figurehead for their fascist movement. They want a Trump who is focused on crushing people they hate and making bold promises to restore conservative white Christians to a place of unearned privilege they feel they've lost. They don't care about his \"I never did it\" conspiracy theories. Most never cared about what he gets up to in his personal life, or even really any crimes committed. The Trumpian conspiracy theories that gain traction are those that validate their culture war grievances. The Big Lie is beloved because it tells them a story where they aren't outnumbered by Americans who disagree with them. But why should they care if Trump breaks the law and cheats on his wife? That was always part of his appeal. That he would deny it at this late date is odd, and suggests he really is becoming unmoored not just from reality, but his own relationship to his base.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType":

The first was strong, deep and creamy, the second was laid back until the money arrived. They were discussing a deal reached during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence a woman who claimed she had an extramarital affair with the Republican candidate.\n\nThe first voice on the recording belonged to Michael D. Cohen, Donald J. Trump's former personal attorney and fixer. The second was the candidate himself, Mr. Trump, who remained silent on Thursday as jurors heard his words.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office used the tape, surreptitiously made by Mr. Cohen, to bring together the trial's two main characters for the first time. The recording vividly shows how Mr. Cohen reported details of a key transaction to his boss at the time.\n\nIn it, Mr. Cohen discusses a secret deal that the National Enquirer's parent company made on Mr. Trump's behalf with former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as well as the question of how to handle the financing, i.e. reimbursement. supermarket tabloid editor David Pecker.\n\nWhat funding? asked Mr. Trump, suddenly snapping to attention. He then ordered Mr. Cohen to pay in cash. (Mr. Pecker, the jurors already know, was never repaid.)\n\nThe existence of the recording, made by Mr. Cohen about two months before the election, was previously known. But it demonstrated to the jury the future president's direct involvement in what prosecutors said was a plot to help him get elected.\n\nIt caps another remarkable day in the first criminal trial of an American president. As the second week of testimony progressed, the proceedings doubled as an autopsy not only of the politics of 2016, but also of the celebrity-obsessed digital media environment into which Mr. Trump entered. to notoriety.\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutors concluded their questioning of Keith Davidson, a Los Angeles lawyer who specialized in representing people with often salacious complaints against celebrities.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Davidson represented Stormy Daniels, a porn star who had threatened to go public with a damaging story about Mr. Trump shortly before that year's election. The 34 charges against Mr. Trump, who faces a sentence of up to four years in prison, stem from this payment, made by Mr. Cohen. Prosecutors say the former president then sought to conceal repayments to his former fixer, which were made after Mr. Trump became president.\n\nOn the stand, Mr. Davidson read aloud a two-word text message he sent in 2016: Funds received.\n\nThose innocuous words marked something momentous: It was the first time jurors had seen direct evidence of the secret payment to Ms. Daniels.\n\nA defense lawyer, Emil Bove, in furious cross-examination, portrayed Mr. Davidson, suddenly red-faced, as a serial extortionist. He accused Mr. Davidson of undermining the Trump campaign, while Mr. Bove said he had other celebrities, including the reality TV star who goes by the name Tila Tequila and the actor Charlie Sheen.\n\nMr Davidson said that during this period he became familiar with extortion law. Mr. Bov\u00e9 asked if he had done so in order to better extract money from his targets while avoiding law enforcement.\n\nYou've done everything you can to get as close to that line as possible without crossing it, right? \" declared Mr. Bov\u00e9.\n\nI did everything I could to ensure that my activities were legal, Mr. Davidson replied.\n\nMr. Davidson began the day by describing his unpleasant relationship with Mr. Cohen, and the former fixers made a feverish effort to keep allegations of Mr. Trump's extramarital affairs out of the public eye. Those efforts included discussions with Mr. Davidson about how Ms. Daniels should respond to an article about the January 2018 deal in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMs. Daniels then said that she had not had any sexual and/or romantic relationship with the president, and on the stand, Mr. Davidson took pains to explain why that was technically true. He said the one-night stand at a Lake Tahoe hotel, which Mr. Trump denies took place, was not romantic.\n\nA prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, asked whether Mr. Davidson intended the statement to be cleverly misleading.\n\nI don't understand the question, Mr. Davidson said, before adding that he would never use the term hush money for the money received. He said he preferred consideration.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bove, Mr. Davidson often sought to turn the scandal into financial gain for himself and his clients. Topics of discussion Thursday included sex tapes from the likes of Tila Tequila and Hulk Hogan, the wrestler. There was talk of actress Lindsay Lohan's stints in rehab and an attempt to shake down Mr. Sheen.\n\nMr. Davidson repeatedly clashed with Mr. Bove, who accused him of obscuring the truth by failing to provide details.\n\nI'm not here to play lawyer games with you, Mr. Bove said. I'm just asking for truthful answers.\n\nYou get truthful answers, sir, Mr. Davidson retorted, putting a sarcastic spin on the last word.\n\nAfter Mr. Davidson left the stand, a forensic analyst who works for the district attorney's office took the stand and quickly presented the recording of Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen kibitzing about the payment to Ms. McDougal.\n\nIn another recording played while Mr. Davidson was on the stand, jurors heard Mr. Cohen say in 2017 that Mr. Trump hated the fact that we did it.\n\nMr. Davidson explained that Mr. Trump was referring to the payment to Ms. Daniels, giving a boost to prosecutors seeking to corroborate Trump's knowledge of and involvement in the deal.\n\nAs he did in his first appearance Tuesday, Mr. Davidson spent much of the day disparaging Mr. Cohen, describing him as aggressive, unpleasant and sometimes unhinged. He testified to Mr. Cohen's discouragement after the 2016 election, when he learned that Mr. Trump had no plans to include him in the administration.\n\nI can't believe I'm not going to Washington, Mr. Davidson recalled telling Mr. Cohen. I thought he was going to kill himself, Mr Davidson said.\n\nMr. Cohen told Congress in 2019 that he had not sought a position in the administration.\n\nThis contradiction and the many unflattering comments about Mr. Cohen could help the defense. But prosecutors may also hope that their release will eliminate their harmful effect, thereby immunizing the jury from damaging information.\n\nThey introduced Mr. Cohen in stages: first, through the remarks of people who know him, then with his voice and his photo. In the coming weeks, Mr. Cohen himself is expected to testify. By then, he might be a well-known figure to jurors, one of whom said he listens to Mr. Cohens' podcast.\n\nMr. Trump himself has continually attacked Mr. Cohen in remarks and online posts that were discussed at two different gag hearings, one of which resulted in a $9,000 contempt of court fine and to a warning of a prison sentence if he persisted. .\n\nOn Thursday morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan heard arguments on four additional statements that prosecutors say violate the order, including remarks in the hallway outside the court, where Mr. Trump took the habit of attacking the affair and the Democrats he believes are behind it. he. The judge did not immediately rule.\n\nMr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, complained vehemently about the lawsuit, saying it took him off the campaign trail and baselessly suggesting that President Biden orchestrated the prosecution. Other targets include Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, who brought the case, and Judge Merchan.\n\nYet Mr. Trump's behavior in Judge Merchan's courtroom was different from that at other recent trials, where he threw tantrums and even stormed out. Mr. Trump was largely subdued, often sitting with his eyes closed as testimony took place. At times he appeared to be dozing.\n\nIn an article on Truth Social on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump denied falling asleep. Sometimes I just close my beautiful blue eyes, listen intently and understand EVERYTHING!!!, he wrote.\n\nIn his questioning of Mr. Davidson on Thursday, Mr. Bove, the defense lawyer, emphasized that the witness had never met or interacted with Mr. Trump.\n\nIn fact, everything you know about President Trump either comes from TV or from Michael Cohen? He asked. Mr Davidson admitted he had no personal interactions with Mr Trump.\n\nBut prosecutors say Mr. Davidson did not need to know Mr. Trump to understand the importance of the secret payment to his White House bid.\n\nProsecutors asked Mr. Davidson to explain a text message exchange just after Election Day in 2016 with Dylan Howard, a top editor at the National Enquirer who helped broker the deal between Mr. Cohen, M. . Davidson and Mrs. Daniels.\n\nWhat have we done? \" Mr. Davidson asked the editor.\n\nMichael Gold, Kate Christobek, Michael Rothfeld, Alan Feuer, Wesley Parnell and Maggie Haberman contributed

During that meeting, they conspired to hide news that could harm Trump and embellish fake stories that disparaged Trump's rivals.\n\nAll was done, Pecker testified, with the express and stated intention of promoting Trump's candidacy for U.S. president.\n\nPecker's testimony made clear that mainstream media's insistence on calling the case a \"hush money\" trial is sloppy. The case is about Trump's conspiracy to violate federal election laws. Paying hush money to a porn star is legal. Falsifying business records to hide illegal campaign contributions is not.\n\nTrump, Pecker and Cohen paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to \"kill\" news that could hurt Trump's campaign, without reporting those payments to the Federal Election Commission as the campaign contributions they were.\n\nALSO READ: 16 worthless things Trump will give you for your money\n\nAs part of the same conspiracy, Trump and Pecker also manufactured fake stories to damage Trump's political rivals. Who can forget Trump's claim that Sen. Ted Cruz's father was involved with the assassination of JFK? During an interview, Trump told Fox News, \"(Cruz's) father was with Lee Harvey Oswald\" just before Oswald was shot.\n\nIt was a complete fabrication hatched by Pecker and Trump, and it made headlines -- as intended.\n\nFederal rules on this question aren't complicated: Under federal campaign finance law, \"anything of value given, loaned or advanced to influence a federal election\" is considered a campaign contribution.\n\nMoney. Office equipment. The purchased silence of an adult film actress.\n\nAll such political contributions to federal candidates' campaign committees are subject to the Federal Election Campaign Act's source prohibitions; they are also legally subject to the Act's amount limitations. Expenditures to purchase media coverage are reported campaign expenses. Expenditures to suppress media coverage are the same.\n\nIn an effort to track illegal contributions, influence and foreign interference, every campaign contribution is tightly monitored, and subject to the Act's recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Individual contributions to politicians' campaign committees are limited to several thousand dollars per person. Nowhere under federal election law can an individual or a candidate advance hundreds of thousands of dollars to directly aid a candidate's campaign without reporting it.\n\nThe crux of Trump's current case -- the first of four separate felony trials he's slated to face -- is Trump's $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to kill her story about their tryst in 2006, just after his wife gave birth to their son, Barron.\n\nTrump similarly conspired to kill a story from Karen McDougal, a Playboy model Trump referred to as \"our girl.\" Pecker's arrangement with McDougal went beyond a simple payment to bury her story about Trump. It also guaranteed McDougal the opportunity to publish her fitness columns with the National Enquirer's parent company, and it included a guarantee of two magazine covers.\n\nPecker testified under oath that the agreement with McDougal was camouflage, intentionally disguised as a \"contract for services\" in an effort to circumvent federal campaign finance laws. Pecker said he feared at the time that what they were doing violated federal law. He said he told Cohen as much at the time, but Cohen was unfazed because, \"Jeff Sessions is the attorney general and Donald Trump has him in his pocket.\"\n\nAnyone hoping Pecker's explosive evidence will dampen the enthusiasm of Trump's supporters will be sorely disappointed, because, thanks to Fox News, they will never know about it.\n\nThe big reveal here isn't the criminality of a defeated ex-president. It isn't that Trump had sex with a porn star. And it isn't that Trump and Cohen, his \"fixer\" -- what kind of presidential candidate has a \"fixer,\" anyway? -- paid to kill stories in order to influence the election.\n\nALSO READ: 'Fraudulent': Trump tormentor Lincoln Project loses big money in cybertheft scheme\n\nThe big story is that, in a trial exposing how Trump used fake news to get elected in 2016, Fox News continues to peddle the same kind of genuinely fake news to its viewers that got it in such massive trouble after Trump's defeat in 2020.\n\nDespite paying nearly $800 million for admittedly lying to viewers about the 2020 election, Fox is up to the same tricks in 2024. Fox continues to falsely portray Trump's trial, while embellishing stories like the \"border invasion\" to harm Trump's political rivals.\n\nDuring voir dire earlier this month, Jesse Watters, a Fox News commentator, announced on Fox: \"They are catching undercover Liberal Activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump Jury,\" painting Trump as a victim of the \"deep state.\" There was, and remains, no evidence of liberal activists trying to get on the jury, and there is no evidence whatsoever that Biden has anything to do with the Manhattan district attorney's charging decisions. Said district attorney is independently elected within New York City\n\nFox also claims that the court requiring Trump to attend his trial, as any criminal defendant is required to do, is \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" On the morning of the first day of Pecker's testimony, instead of discussing what Pecker said, the network platformed Trump's rants against the entire trial, as he fumed outside the courtroom, full throttle, for nearly three full minutes.\n\nOn the night of Pecker's shocking testimony, which made headlines across nearly all mainstream outlets, Foxnews.com didn't cover it in any meaningful way. The only trial-related news Fox ran called the trial an \"historic mistake,\" based on an editorial that was written prior to Pecker's testimony.\n\nWith the headline, \"Law professor roasts Manhattan DA's case against Trump in NY Times guest essay,\" Fox buried all pertinent facts about Pecker's testimony, substituting real news with fake news and spin just as Pecker, Cohen and Trump did in 2016.\n\nAs the 2016 election and January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol proved, fake news is powerful. The resulting damage to our country, the election process, public discourse and democratic norms is incalculable.\n\nThis week, former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who served on the U.S. House's J6 select committee, described Fox News' \"line-up of flame-throwing commentators\" who, every night, shout \"alarms about the so-called communists and socialists -- read: liberals -- who supposedly threatened America's very existence.\"\n\nNoting how Rush Limbaugh, then Tucker Carlson, and now Jesse Watters have all \"served the same function -- twisting facts and making their followers' blood boil\" in service to the party of Trump, Kinzinger concluded that, \"these [GOP adjacent] media figures have done more to divide America than another single factor ...\"\n\nALSO READ: A criminologist explains why Trump's Manhattan trial is the biggest threat to his freedom\n\nIt is also widely suspected that Russian propaganda has \"infected a good chunk of\" the GOP base, because Fox News constantly repeats Putin talking points in service to Trump.\n\nWriting for the Washington Post, Robert Kagan wryly observed that, \"A healthy republic would not be debating whether Trump and his followers seek the overthrow of the Founders' system of liberal democracy. What more do people need to see (other than Trump's) well-documented attempt to prevent the peaceful transfer of power...?\"\n\nKagan is not wrong, but he assumes the MAGA base has seen evidence of Trump's well-documented criminality. They have not. Fox News-watching MAGA voters haven't seen, heard or read about Trump's crimes, because Fox News consistently lies about them, just as it is continuing to lie about Trump's separate election interference case.\n\nFox has convinced roughly 40 percent of Americans that a dangerous demagogue is qualified to have the nuclear codes once again. Just as Hitler's supporters eventually learned that his power was based on manufactured propaganda, Trump's supporters will, gradually and eventually, learn the same. As long as their belief system remains unchallenged by their main source of information, Fox News, they can delay their own moment of reckoning.\n\nPerhaps their reckoning will begin when Fox next appears in court to face the staggering damages they have caused through their destructive brand of fake news.\n\nA massive, adverse court ruling kind of accountability that hurts -- and one that can't be hushed up -- would be an excellent start.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Campaign_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Campaign Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Prosecutors Say He Was Hiding Other Crimes.", "body": "Donald J. Trump faces 34 felony counts in his Manhattan trial, but none involve the other misconduct that prosecutors say he engaged in.\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, all stemming from accusations that he covered up a $130,000 hush-money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to suppress her story of a sexual liaison with him.\n\nWhy are they felony charges? Here are the basics.\n\nWhat is a felony?\n\nA felony is a crime of greater seriousness than a misdemeanor, and conviction of a felony carries the possible penalty of a year or more in prison.\n\nFalsifying business records in New York State can be a misdemeanor, but prosecutors can bring the charge as a felony if they believe the records were falsified to conceal another crime.\n\nManhattan district attorney Alvin L. Bragg had suggested that Mr. Trump concealed three potential crimes, although he has not charged him with any of those.\n\nProsecutors do not need to prove such crimes were committed -- only that there was \"the intent to commit or conceal\" an additional crime.\n\nWhat do the business records show?\n\nThe $130,000 payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, in the final days of the 2016 campaign. Mr. Cohen said he had done so at Mr. Trump's direction.\n\nWhile \"hush money\" payments are not necessarily illegal, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen during his presidency. In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the repayment to Mr. Cohen as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Prosecutors say there were no such expenses or retainer agreement.\n\nThe records related to the reimbursement underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 counts involve the checks issued to Mr. Cohen, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company, and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust.\n\nWhat crimes do prosecutors believe Trump was trying to conceal?\n\nProsecutors have suggested three possible crimes since filing the charges against Mr. Trump last year: a federal campaign finance violation, tax fraud and a state election-law crime. But since the start of the trial, they have largely focused on the state election-law crime: conspiracy to promote or prevent election.\n\nProsecutors have framed the falsified documents as concealing a broader conspiracy to protect Mr. Trump's campaign. They allege that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen coordinated with the former publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to bury stories that could damage Mr. Trump's campaign and promote others that would harm his political rivals.\n\nMr. Pecker testified about how the tabloid purchased the story of a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who said she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump, and about how he declined to buy Ms. Daniels's story and suggested that Mr. Cohen buy it instead.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retainer_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retainer agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_ledger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General ledger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/26/multimedia/26trump-trial-felony-qlwb/26trump-trial-felony-qlwb-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Then, he lamented not being able to celebrate his wife Melania's birthday with her, saying nothing of the fact that she could have jetted to see him (\"I wish I could be with my lovely wife on her birthday, but instead, a CROOKED prosecutor has me STUCK IN A COURTROOM!\" that solicitation read.) And then, as the doting grandfather, Trump posted to Truth Social a photo of him with his grandchildren next to a golf cart, all of them dressed in white.\n\n\"With Donald, everything is transactional, including his family relationships,\" said David Cay Johnston, the Trump biographer and investigative journalist. \"Lots of people have had their spouses who know they're going to be humiliated show up in court. But not Donald.\"\n\nPresidential candidates and their advisers have always used their families, when it suits them, as campaign props. None have attempted to do so amid the backdrop of a pornstar hush money trial -- especially when his wife, daughter Ivanka and other close family members have shunned joining the former president at his New York trial.\n\n\"If there's anything that the whole Trump family understands, it's optics,\" said Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former press secretary who resigned on Jan. 6, 2021. \"And the moment people started to notice no family around, Eric showed up to the last court date. It's all for show.\"\n\nInto this absence of familial support strode Trump's son, the first family member to attend the trial and who listened to testimony in-person during the day. Father and son spoke, separated by a wooden barrier.\n\nHe heard testimony from Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, about brokering the women's deals to sell their stories.\n\nOne witness for the prosecution, however, portrayed Trump and his connections to his family in a much more positive light. The former president's longtime confidante, Hope Hicks, on Friday took the stand and testified under oath for about three hours.\n\nDuring her emotional testimony, Hicks recounted how Trump didn't want Melania to learn about his alleged affairs and went so far as to prevent newspapers being delivered to their residence on the day the Wall Street Journal in 2016 published a story on the hush money payment to McDougal.\n\n\"President Trump really values Mrs. Trump's opinion, and she doesn't weigh in all the time, but when she does, it's really meaningful to him,\" Hicks said. \"And, you know, he really, really respects what she has to say. So I think he was just concerned about what her perception of this would be.\"\n\nShe later added: \"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign.\"\n\nTrump's campaign said the former president's family speak to him daily and are helping him run his campaign and business.\n\n\"This story is another disgusting attempt to paint a completely false picture of President Trump's family,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump's campaign spokesperson, said in a statement. \"President Trump's family has courageously withstood years of brazen attacks, unfair investigations, and outright lies, and they continue to stand 100% with him as he fights Crooked Joe Biden's sham trial in court.\"\n\nFor Melania, who was said to be angered by initial reports in 2018 that her husband paid off a pornstar, the trial also presents a thorny marital matter. The alleged affair with Daniels took place in 2006, the year after Trump and Melania's wedding, an event the prosecution's first witness, the former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker attended.\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me she's not at the trial -- I wouldn't imagine she would be at any trial, that's just not her scene,\" Grisham said.\n\nAnd she has not fully receded from public view amid the trial, appearing on the fundraising circuit five days into the trial at an event for the Log Cabin Republicans on April 20 at Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida, club where the family lives.\n\nTrump's direct familial appeals, said the former president's chronicler, have not always been deft.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a performance artist, and he wants people watching this trial to believe he's a dedicated family man and father, even though his own personal history, and the facts that are in play in this case, undermine both of those claims,\" said Tim O'Brien, the Trump biographer and critic. \"So it's cartoonish of him to talk about family and his inability to go to his son's graduation or celebrate his wife's birthday with his wife when he was very willing in the past to visit indignities upon them.\"\n\nFar from the courtroom, talk of the trial is news of the day, and impossible to avoid with cable television in earshot. \"I think everybody has made their own assessment of President Trump's character, and so far as I know you don't pay someone $130,000 not to have sex with you,\" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told CNN.\n\nIt's unclear whether other members of Trump's family will make an appearance as he presses on through the rest of the trial.\n\nTrump, though, seems to be keenly aware of how crucial his family -- and being seen with them -- are at this legally perilous moment.\n\nJohnston said, \"He uses his family as props when he thinks it's helpful.\"", "source": {"uri":

It's not just the over-the-top belligerence that Trump demands from his lawyers, which runs the risk of angering both the judge and the jury, Trump wants his lawyers to stick to his preposterous claims that he's never done anything wrong. He wants to pretend that he's the most perfect man who ever lived and that anyone who says otherwise has some secret agenda to victimize him.\n\nAs this trial goes on, the defense team has adopted Trump's favored tactic of floating conspiracy theories to explain away the mounting pile of evidence against him. In some cases, they may be trying to convince at least one juror the conspiracy theory is the same as reasonable doubt. But there appears to be another audience they're trying to reach: Trump's MAGA fans.\n\nMAGA has long relied on conspiracy theories to justify their odious political beliefs. For some reason, Trump seems to believe his followers need a story to tell to claim he's innocent of everything said about him during this trial, even though he very obviously isn't. So he's making his lawyers waste their time propagating the narrative instead of focusing their energies solely on the goal of confusing at least one juror to render a hung jury.\n\nBut Trump's supporters don't seem to be biting. MAGA may not love that their leader is on trial, but the conspiracy theories he's floating are so asinine that even his most shameless hype men are shying away from repeating them. It turns out there are conspiracy theories that are too dumb for even the Trump base to embrace. This disconnect also suggests that Trump's self-absorption is causing him to lose sight of what, exactly, his followers want from him.\n\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\n\nThe most obvious and frankly hilarious example: The defense team is sticking by Trump's story that he never had sex with Stormy Daniels. I can hear readers scoffing, but it's true, they're really going that route. Even in his opening statement, defense attorney Todd Blanche argued that Daniels' story is a \"false claim of a sexual encounter\" with Trump, one she made up as part of an extortion scheme.\n\nAs a defense strategy in court, this seems ill-advised. As anyone who has seen Daniels in an interview can attest, she comes across as a credible person. Certainly much more so than Trump, who lies and dissembles every waking moment of the day. But also, it just doesn't make sense. As no other than Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters recently, \"You don't pay someone $130,000 not to have sex with you.\" Plus, Trump's-then attorney (now turned state's witness) Michael Cohen was threatening Daniels to shut up years before the pay-off scheme, which wouldn't have been true if she made it all up to extort a presidential candidate in 2016. Plus, there's the other mistress, Karen McDougal, helping establish that Trump was not averse to adultery.\n\nTelling such an obvious whopper to a jury seems like it will backfire by making them believe the defense attorneys are just liars. Trump's claims of sexual virtue seem more aimed at the outside audience, as if he hopes his supporters will start parroting his ridiculous notions that he's never done anything wrong. There were a couple of half-baked efforts to do this. The far-right network OAN even tried to float the conspiracy theory that it was Cohen, not Trump, who had sex with Daniels -- but they were quickly forced to retract the story and apologize to Cohen. That's highly unusual for the network, which seems to exist primarily to spread right-wing disinformation. Part of this is because Cohen threatened to sue. But OAN didn't even bother to put up a fight. It suggests that even the folks at OAN are a bit embarrassed by this.\n\nTrump's lawyers are leaning into the narrative that he is a perfect angel who just keeps being targeted by vast conspiracies. During the cross-examination of lawyer Keith Davidson, who represented Daniels as Trump and Cohen paid her hush money, Trump attorney Emil Bove kept pushing the \"extortion\" conspiracy theory. He appeared to be arguing that Daniels and Davidson had concocted a shakedown scheme. But it doesn't pass the basic common sense test to argue that Trump would be so threatened by a false story that he'd pay her this much money.\n\nThings got even sillier on Thursday when Bove questioned forensics expert Douglas Daus. Daus was just there to verify that text messages and recordings from Cohen's phone were real. But Bove tore into the guy, repeatedly suggesting the information extracted from the phone was compromised or fabricated in some way as if the texts and recordings were the product of a \"deep state\" conspiracy. It's hard to imagine this is for a jury made up of people who were screened to make sure they aren't QAnon-style nuts. Likelier is the hope that this conspiracy theory will get traction in the right-wing propaganda machine, feeding Trump followers talking points they can use to dismiss it if the jury convicts.\n\nBut what's fascinating is that the MAGA media doesn't seem to be biting. Instead of trying to discredit the allegations against Trump, the right-wing press has gone with a deflect-and-distract strategy. As Media Matters chronicled, Fox News is doing lots of \"look over there!\"-style segments making a big deal out of Trump's press events at bodegas, rather than grappling with what's going on inside the courtroom. The network is also pushing the idea that Trump should get \"immunity\" for all his crimes, which feels like a tacit admission of guilt. Even those who are trying to get conspiracy theories going, like Steve Bannon at War Room, are focused on attacking the prosecutors for having \"political\" motivations. Denying the truth of the allegations is not a priority, because even the MAGA audiences won't buy it.\n\nIn the past, Trump has clearly understood that even his supporters don't buy the idea that he's a good person. If anything, his transgressions, both legal and criminal, are part of his appeal. He's an aspirational figure to people who wish they could also cheat on their wives and commit crimes, all without facing consequences. While they do have an astounding amount of tolerance for his endless whining, his appeal was never his \"woe is me\" victim act, but his impunity.\n\nIt also shows he forgets what his supporters want from him: A figurehead for their fascist movement. They want a Trump who is focused on crushing people they hate and making bold promises to restore conservative white Christians to a place of unearned privilege they feel they've lost. They don't care about his \"I never did it\" conspiracy theories. Most never cared about what he gets up to in his personal life, or even really any crimes committed. The Trumpian conspiracy theories that gain traction are those that validate their culture war grievances.

Cohen, his former personal lawyer and fixer, as \"legal expenses.\" Mr. Cohen made the payment to Ms. Daniels in the last days of the 2016 campaign.\n\nMr. McConney got involved the following February, according to a statement of facts filed by prosecutors that identified him only as the \"TO Controller,\" using the abbreviation for Mr. Trump's company. That month, prosecutors say, Mr. Cohen emailed an invoice to Mr. McConney for $35,000 worth of legal expenses in January 2017 and the same for February 2017.\n\nProsecutors say that the company's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, approved the payments, and then Mr. McConney asked another accounting division employee to issue them and to register them as \"legal expenses.\" The payments continued through 2017.\n\nMr. McConney testified for several days last November in a civil fraud case against Mr. Trump that was brought by the New York State attorney general's office. Mr. McConney was also a defendant in the case.\n\nAfter 35 years at the Trump Organization, he said on the stand that he could no longer handle working there amid its legal challenges.\n\n\"I just wanted to relax and stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I loved working for,\" he said in November.\n\nThe judge who ruled in the civil fraud case, Arthur F.

But not Donald.\"\n\nPresidential candidates and their advisers have always used their families, when it suits them, as campaign props. None have attempted to do so amid the backdrop of a pornstar hush money trial -- especially when his wife, daughter Ivanka and other close family members have shunned joining the former president at his New York trial.\n\n\"If there's anything that the whole Trump family understands, it's optics,\" said Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former press secretary who resigned on Jan. 6, 2021. \"And the moment people started to notice no family around, Eric showed up to the last court date. It's all for show.\"\n\nInto this absence of familial support strode Trump's son, the first family member to attend the trial and who listened to testimony in-person during the day. Father and son spoke, separated by a wooden barrier.\n\nHe heard testimony from Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, about brokering the women's deals to sell their stories.\n\nOne witness for the prosecution, however, portrayed Trump and his connections to his family in a much more positive light. The former president's longtime confidante, Hope Hicks, on Friday took the stand and testified under oath for about three hours.\n\nDuring her emotional testimony, Hicks recounted how Trump didn't want Melania to learn about his alleged affairs and went so far as to prevent newspapers being delivered to their residence on the day the Wall Street Journal in 2016 published a story on the hush money payment to McDougal.\n\n\"President Trump really values Mrs. Trump's opinion, and she doesn't weigh in all the time, but when she does, it's really meaningful to him,\" Hicks said. \"And, you know, he really, really respects what she has to say. So I think he was just concerned about what her perception of this would be.\"\n\nShe later added: \"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign.\"\n\nTrump's campaign said the former president's family speak to him daily and are helping him run his campaign and business.\n\n\"This story is another disgusting attempt to paint a completely false picture of President Trump's family,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump's campaign spokesperson, said in a statement. \"President Trump's family has courageously withstood years of brazen attacks, unfair investigations, and outright lies, and they continue to stand 100% with him as he fights Crooked Joe Biden's sham trial in court.\"\n\nFor Melania, who was said to be angered by initial reports in 2018 that her husband paid off a pornstar, the trial also presents a thorny marital matter. The alleged affair with Daniels took place in 2006, the year after Trump and Melania's wedding, an event the prosecution's first witness, the former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker attended.\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me she's not at the trial -- I wouldn't imagine she would be at any trial, that's just not her scene,\" Grisham said.\n\nAnd she has not fully receded from public view amid the trial, appearing on the fundraising circuit five days into the trial at an event for the Log Cabin Republicans on April 20 at Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida, club where the family lives.\n\nTrump's direct familial appeals, said the former president's chronicler, have not always been deft.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a performance artist, and he wants people watching this trial to believe he's a dedicated family man and father, even though his own personal history, and the facts that are in play in this case, undermine both of those claims,\" said Tim O'Brien, the Trump biographer and critic. \"So it's cartoonish of him to talk about family and his inability to go to his son's graduation or celebrate his wife's birthday with his wife when he was very willing in the past to visit indignities upon them.\"\n\nFar from the courtroom, talk of the trial is news of the day, and impossible to avoid with cable television in earshot. \"I think everybody has made their own assessment of President Trump's character, and so far as I know you don't pay someone $130,000 not to have sex with you,\" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told CNN.\n\nIt's unclear whether other members of Trump's family will make an appearance as he presses on through the rest of the trial.\n\nTrump, though, seems to be keenly aware of how crucial his family -- and being seen with them -- are at this legally perilous moment.\n\nJohnston said, \"He uses his family as props when he thinks it's helpful.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Grisham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephanie Grisham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cay_Johnston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Cay Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_Cabin_Republicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Log Cabin Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Reunions", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Reunions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/991fd95/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x800%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F9f%2F51%2F81147bb44684bce04b71d4506b83%2Ftrump-hush-money-90162.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 3430, "textEnd": 3438}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

There are, of course, occasional fireworks, but those are few and far between. For the most part, trials are long sessions of boring questions with people reading from documents. (That explains, in part, why Trump is sleeping through parts of his trial. Trials are dull.)\n\nPress reports, unlike trials, cannot be tedious. If press reports were boring, then no one would read (or listen to) them. Thus, by definition, what you hear in the press is a condensed, and much more interesting, version of the trial than is actually occurring. Moreover, the press reports are focusing on what the reporter thinks is interesting. You have no idea whether that's what any particular juror thought was interesting.\n\nSecond, as a general matter, you always think that your side is winning at trial. Through four decades as a litigator, I've sat through an awful lot of trials in my life. (Admittedly, those have all been civil cases; perhaps criminal cases are different.) During all of those trials, the team on my side of the \"v\" has always thought that we were winning. That's perfectly natural, and it happens for two reasons. The first reason is that you've been studying your side of the case for years. You know the answers to everything the other side says. You've come to believe that your side is right.\n\nThe second reason has to do with groupthink. Suppose your side has a terrible day at trial. Your witness was destroyed on cross-examination. Your team assembles for dinner. Everyone is despondent. Somebody says that one aspect of the day actually was okay for your side. Another person latches on to that point. A third person notes something else that went well that day. By the end of dinner, you've all convinced yourself that things were not so grim; the day pretty much played to a draw. And you should see how dinner sounds on trial days that actually went well for you. People don't want to focus on the negative, so they convince themselves that they're doing better than they are.\n\nSo, too, with television coverage of trials. MSNBC and Fox News each have slanted coverage to begin with. Their viewers don't want to be burdened with hearing that their side is losing. Independent of that, each station's panels of pundits are filled with folks who hold similar political views. The one defense lawyer on an MSNBC panel is quickly shouted down by the six other panelists convinced that Trump is being destroyed at trial. On Fox News, it's exactly the opposite.\n\nThus, Fox News viewers are hearing, more or less, that, \"The judge today threatened to put Donald Trump, a leading candidate for the presidency, in jail. Just for speaking!\" On MSNBC, exactly the same events are cast, more or less, as, \"Donald Trump once again took to social media to intimidate witnesses. If Trump were a typical defendant, he'd already be in jail. It's unbelievable that the judge hasn't yet locked him up!\"\n\nOn MSNBC, Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels' former lawyer, testified about the seedy underside of the publishing industry and the money that changed hands to conceal stories about Trump's affairs. Trump was engaged in filthy business. On Fox, you'll hear that Davidson wanted to get paid before the election because he had more leverage then. \"See? Leverage! It was all just a matter of extorting money from Trump.\"\n\nOn Fox, Hope Hicks testified that Trump wanted to prevent newspaper reports about Stormy Daniels from reaching the White House residence, so Melania wouldn't be enraged by the reporting. \"See? It's all about Melania! This had nothing to do with the election! Trump was concerned only that his wife would be upset by the Stormy Daniels news.\" On MSNBC, Hicks conceded that Trump was concerned about how the Stormy Daniels story would affect the election, so the payment of hush money was election interference. Trump worried about his wife's reaction, too, but that really doesn't matter: If a payment served two purposes, one related to an election and one not, it's still a crime to conceal that payment.\n\nLiberals and conservatives live in two different universes on the best of days. But those two universes have been pulled even further apart by coverage of the ongoing trial.\n\nWhich means one thing: At the end of the trial, one side or the other is going to be startled, and dismayed, to learn that their side lost.", "source": {"uri": "abovethelaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Above the Law"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_herrmann@abovethelaw.com", "name": "Mark Herrmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groupthink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2147830087-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Celebrity rehab! Trump hush-money trial goes full National Enquirer as Hulk Hogan, Lindsay Lohan, Charlie Sheen are name-dropped.", "body": "Trump's hush-money trial went full National Enquirer during a heated cross-examination on Thursday. Stormy Daniels rep Keith Davidson was grilled by Trump's lawyer on his salacious previous cases. Charlie Sheen, Hulk Hogan, Lindsay Lohan, and Tila Tequila were all name-dropped.\n\nDonald Trump's hush-money trial has always had the National Enquirer as its flashy backdrop.\n\nBut Thursday's testimony was so chock-a-block with talk of C-list celebrity sex tapes and rehab scoops, it was as if the supermarket tabloid had somehow engulfed the proceeding.\n\nCharlie Sheen, Hulk Hogan, Lindsay Lohan, Floyd Mayweather, Tila Tequila -- all were name-dropped in morning testimony.\n\nWhat explains their cameo appearances on week two of testimony in the only-ever criminal trial of a current or former president?\n\nTurns out each has had a run-in with attorney Keith Davidson, a key prosecution witness who repped both former Playboy Bunny Karen McDougal and porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nManhattan prosecutors say that Trump falsified 34 business records in order to hide an illegal, election-influencing, 2016 hush-money payment to Daniels.\n\nOn direct, Davidson told jurors how both women pursued catch-and-kill cash from the Enquirer for their tales of sex with Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump attorney Emil Bove went on the attack.\n\nBove appeared to have one main mission in cross-examining Davidson -- to create distance between Trump and his campaign on one side, and the lawyer's wheeling and dealing on the other.\n\n\"You've never met President Trump, correct?\" Bove asked Davidson, as his very first question.\n\n\"Never,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"And Tuesday was the first time that you've been in the same room as him, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"That's true,\" the witness answered.\n\n\"You've never spoken to President Trump?\"\n\n\"Never,\" he answered.\n\nScandals and money\n\nThen Bove amped up his attack, with a series of questions suggesting that Davidson, who was a top source of stories for the Enquirer's editor, had made a career of shakedowns and scandal-mongering,\n\nTrump was a victim, not an instigator, in any hush-money schemes, the line of questioning implied.\n\n\"What does the word 'extortion' mean to you?\" Bove asked Davidson.\n\n\"Extortion is the -- \" Davidson fumbled. \"It's the obtaining of property by threat of fear or force,\" he said.\n\n\"When you were negotiating on behalf of Ms. McDougal and on behalf of Stormy Daniels, one of your concerns was staying on the right side of the line with respect to extortion, correct?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I suppose,\" Davidson answered, hesitantly.\n\nAt another point, Bove asked, \"In 2016, you were well-versed in getting right up to the line, without committing extortion, right?\"\n\n\"I don't understand the question,\" Davidson answered after a pause.\n\nAnd in this context came Thursday's onslaught of C-lister cameos.\n\nFirst, Hulk Hogan\n\n\"Isn't it a fact that in connection with events in 2012, you were investigated by state and federal authorities for committing extortion against Terry Bollea -- Hulk Hogan,\" Bove asked.\n\nBollea is Hogan's given name.\n\n\"That's true,\" Davidson answered.\n\nThen Davidson was asked about the infamous Hogan sex tape. It was he who pursued Hogan for cash to purchase, and bury, the tape, Davidson conceded.\n\n\"At some point in 2012, you reached out to Hulk Hogan's representatives, right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Davidson .\n\n\"You made a monetary demand to Hulk Hogan's representative in order to not publish these tapes, correct?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"No,\" Davidson answered.\n\nMoments later, as Bove's cross-examination continued, Davidson backpedaled.\n\n\"Did you ask for money?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"There was a monetary demand made,\" Davidson answered, vaguely.\n\n\"Was it for purchase, so that Hulk Hogan could purchase the tapes? The rights to the tapes?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson admitted.\n\nThen, Lindsay Lohan\n\nDavidson said he also represented an employee at the Betty Ford rehab clinic in 2010.\n\nAnd she \"leaked information about the treatment of Lindsay Lohan at a rehab facility, correct?\" Bove asked.\n\nDavidson spent a very long pause, taking a sip of water.\n\n\"It was reported that that's what she did,\" the witness answered cautiously.\n\nBove noted that the story ran in TMZ, and asked \"and you had connections at TMZ at the time, right?\"\n\n\"True,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"You still do, right?\"\n\n\"No. Well, perhaps,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Bove responded, skeptically.\n\nYou helped the former rehab employee get paid in connection with the Lohan leak, Bove then demanded.\n\n\"I don't recall,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"You don't recall that TMZ paid $10,000 around this time?\n\n\"I don't recall,\" Davidson answered again.\n\nNext up: Tila Tequila\n\n\"Do you know who Tila Tequila is?\" Bove then asked, suddenly, of the reality TV personality.\n\n\"I do,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"And in 2010, you took steps to broker a deal of a sex tape involving her, correct?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" Davidson answered.\n\nDavidson was asked if he worked on that \"engagement\" with someone named Kevin Blatt -- \"sort of known as a sex tape broker, is that right?\"\n\n\"I think that's fair,\" Davidson answered cautiously.\n\nBove asked Davidson if he recalled that \"Ms. Tequila\" was threatened by a man who said if she didn't pay $75,000, the sex tape would be published.\n\n\"I don't recall that,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"You don't recall at the time of that transaction, you were on a 90-day bar suspension?\" Bove pressed.\n\n\"I don't recall that,\" came Davidson's answer, once again.\n\nAnd finally ... Charlie Sheen\n\nThe topic of the cross-examination then veered without warning to Charlie Sheen.\n\n\"You know who Charlie Sheen is, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I do,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"And you've represented some clients who you helped get paid by Charlie Sheen, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I've represented several clients who had claims against Charlie Sheen,\" Davidson answered carefully.\n\n\"And who you extracted sums of money from Charlie Sheen on behalf of, correct?\" the Trump lawyer pushed.\n\nDavidson smiled.\n\n\"There was no extraction,\" he answered, adding, \"we asserted that there was tortious activity committed and valid settlements that were executed.\"\n\nBove asked Davidson to talk about his representation of one Sheen accuser he said \"was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time,\" in 2011.\n\n\"You don't recall she was barely completing sentences when you got her to sign the letter\" agreeing to Davidson's representation, Bove asked.\n\n\"No, I don't recall that,\" Davidson answered.\n\nDavidson testified he did remember that the woman had been referred to him by Blatt, the so-called sex-tape broker. But he didn't remember if Sheen paid the woman $2 million.\n\n\"Is it fair to say that your memory seems a little fuzzy around some of these issues?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I've had 1,500 clients in my career,\" Davidson protested. \"You're asking me about events that took place many, many years ago.\"\n\n\"A $2 million payment is a typical payment for you on one of these cases? So much so that you don't remember it? Is that your testimony?\" Bove asked, his voice rising in pitch.\n\n\"I don't remember a settlement from 13 years ago,\" Davidson answered.\n\nAt another point in the Sheen portion of Thursday's testimony, Bove asked Davidson if he remembered \"extracting another settlement from Mr. Sheen\" while representing Capri Anderson.\n\n\"Again, it was no extraction,\" Davidson responded.\n\n\"You got Mr. Sheen to pay, correct?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"Assuming arguendo that he did pay and that there was a settlement agreement, that settlement would be confidential,\" Davidson snapped. \"And I would not discuss it here.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Bove shot back. \"We're both lawyers. I'm not here to play lawyer games with you. I'm just here to ask questions and get straight answers.\"\n\nThe judge sustained an objection to this non-question from the prosecution.\n\nDavidson then invoked attorney-client privilege in declining to say if there was a settlement between Anderson and Sheen.\n\nTestimony continues Friday.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl",

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nDonald Trump's hush-money trial has always had the National Enquirer as its flashy backdrop.\n\nBut Thursday's testimony was so chock-a-block with talk of C-list celebrity sex tapes and rehab scoops, it was as if the supermarket tabloid had somehow engulfed the proceeding.\n\nCharlie Sheen, Hulk Hogan, Lindsay Lohan, Floyd Mayweather, Tila Tequila -- all were name-dropped in morning testimony.\n\nWhat explains their cameo appearances on week two of testimony in the only-ever criminal trial of a current or former president?\n\nTurns out each has had a run-in with attorney Keith Davidson, a key prosecution witness who repped both former Playboy Bunny Karen McDougal and porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nManhattan prosecutors say that Trump falsified 34 business records in order to hide an illegal, election-influencing, 2016 hush-money payment to Daniels.\n\nOn direct, Davidson told jurors how both women pursued catch-and-kill cash from the Enquirer for their tales of sex with Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump attorney Emil Bove went on the attack.\n\nBove appeared to have one main mission in cross-examining Davidson -- to create distance between Trump and his campaign on one side, and the lawyer's wheeling and dealing on the other.\n\n\"You've never met President Trump, correct?\" Bove asked Davidson, as his very first question.\n\n\"Never,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"And Tuesday was the first time that you've been in the same room as him, right?\" Bove asked.\n\nThen Bove amped up his attack, with a series of questions suggesting that Davidson, who was a top source of stories for the Enquirer's editor, had made a career of shakedowns and scandal-mongering,\n\nTrump was a victim, not an instigator, in any hush-money schemes, the line of questioning implied.\n\n\"What does the word 'extortion' mean to you?\" Bove asked Davidson.\n\n\"Extortion is the -- \" Davidson fumbled. \"It's the obtaining of property by threat of fear or force,\" he said.\n\n\"When you were negotiating on behalf of Ms. McDougal and behalf of Stormy Daniels, one of your concerns was on staying on the right side of the line with respect to extortion, correct?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I suppose,\" Davidson answered, hesitantly.\n\nAt another point, Bove asked, \"In 2016, you were well-versed in getting right up to the line, without committing extortion, right?\"\n\n\"I don't understand the question,\" Davidson answered after a pause.\n\nAnd in this context came Thursday's onslaught of C-lister cameos.\n\n\"Isn't it a fact that in connection with events in 2012, you were investigated by state and federal authorities for committing extortion against Terry Bollea -- Hulk Hogan,\" Bove asked.\n\nDavidson was asked about the infamous Hogan sex tape. It was Davidson who asked Hogan for cash to purchase, and bury, the tape, the witness conceded.\n\n\"At some point in 2012, you reached out to Hulk Hogan's representatives, right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Davidson .\n\n\"You made a monetary demand to Hulk Hogan's representative in order to not publish these tapes, correct?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"No,\" Davidson answered.\n\nMoments later, as Bove's cross-examination continued, Davidson backpedaled.\n\n\"Did you ask for money?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"There was a monetary demand made,\" Davidson answered, vaguely.\n\n\"Was it for purchase, so that Hulk Hogan could purchase the tapes? The rights to the tapes?\" Bove asked.\n\nDavidson took a very long pause, during which he took a sip of water.\n\n\"It was reported that that's what she did,\" the witness answered cautiously.\n\nBove noted that the story ran in TMZ, and asked \"and you had connections at TMZ at the time, right?\"\n\n\"You helped Ms. Holland get paid in connection with what I just described, didn't you?\" Bove then demanded.\n\n\"I don't recall,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"You don't recall that TMZ paid Ms. Holland $10,000 around this time?\n\n\"I don't recall,\" Davidson answered again.\n\n\"Do you know who Tila Tequila is?\" Bove then asked suddenly of the reality TV personality.\n\n\"I do,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"And in 2010, you took steps to broker a deal of a sex tape involving her, correct?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" Davidson answered.\n\nDavidson was asked if he worked on that \"engagement\" with someone named Kevin Blatt -- \"sort of known as a sex tape broker, is that right?\"\n\n\"I think that's fair,\" Davidson answered cautiously.\n\nBove asked Davidson if he recalled that \"Ms. Tequila\" was threatened by a man who said if she didn't pay $75,000 the sex tape would be published.\n\n\"I don't recall that,\" Davidson answered.\n\n\"You don't recall at the time of that transaction, you were on a 90-day bar suspension?\" Bove pressed.\n\n\"I don't recall that,\" came Davidson's answer, once again.\n\nThe topic of the cross-examination then veered without warning to Charlie Sheen.\n\n\"And you've represented some clients who you helped get paid by Charlie Sheen, right?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I've represented several clients who had claims against Charlie Sheen,\" Davidson answered carefully.\n\n\"And who you extracted sums of money from Charlie Sheen on behalf of, correct?\" the Trump lawyer pushed.\n\nDavidson smiled.\n\n\"There was no extraction,\" he answered, adding, \"we asserted that there was tortious activity committed and valid settlements that were executed.\"\n\nBove asked Davidson to talk about his representation of one Sheen accuser he said \"was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time,\" in 2011.\n\n\"You don't recall she was barely completing sentences when you got her to sign the letter\" agreeing to Davidson's representation, Bove asked.\n\n\"No, I don't recall that,\" Davidson answered.\n\nDavidson testified he did remember that the woman had been referred to him by Blatt, the so-called sex-tape broker. But he didn't remember if Sheen paid the woman $2 million.\n\n\"Is it fair to say that your memory seems a little fuzzy around some of these issues?\" Bove asked.\n\n\"I've had 1,500 clients in my career,\" Davidson protested. \"You're asking me about events that took place many, many years ago.\"\n\n\"A $2 million payment is a typical payment for you on one of these cases? So much so that you don't remember it? Is that your testimony?\" Bove asked, his voice rising in pitch.\n\n\"I don't remember a settlement from 13 years ago,\" Davidson answered.\n\nAt another point in the Sheen portion of Thursday's testimony, Bove asked Davidson if he remembered \"extracting another settlement from Mr. Sheen\" while representing Capri Anderson.\n\n\"Assuming arguendo that he did pay and that there was a settlement agreement, that settlement would be confidential,\" Davidson snapped. \"And I would not discuss it here.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Bove shot back. \"We're both lawyers. I'm not here to play lawyer games with you. I'm just here to ask questions and get straight answers.\"\n\nThe judge sustained an objection to this non-question from the prosecution.\n\nDavidson then invoked attorney-client privilege in declining to say if there was a settlement between Anderson and Sheen.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Maybe you've even had clients who paint a false or misleading picture of their financial activities.\n\nGary Farro, a former senior managing director at First Republic Bank, recently found himself under a spotlight because of one such challenging client. On Tuesday, he finished testifying at the first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history.\n\nFarro's problematic client was Michael Cohen, the former Trump Organization lawyer who paid $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nManhattan prosecutors have charged former President Donald Trump with falsifying business records in connection with payments that he later made to Cohen, allegedly to reimburse the attorney for his effort to cover up a Trump sexual affair.\n\nCohen, who to various criminal charges, including campaign finance violations and making false statements to a federally insured bank, has morphed into a prominent nemesis of the former president. He is expected to testify later in the trial.\n\nBut first, the jury heard from Farro, a New Jersey resident who last year joined Flagstar Bank, a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorp, after . He was called as a prosecution witness, and he said that he was testifying voluntarily.\n\nFarro's was both mundane and extraordinary. It focused on the kind of back-office work that banks do all the time in an effort to know who their customers are, but It also came in the midst of a presidential campaign in which the defendant is the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nFrom the witness stand, Farro recalled being assigned Cohen as a client in 2015.\n\n\"I can only tell you what I was told,\" he explained. \"I was selected because of my knowledge and my ability to handle, um, individuals that may be a little challenging.\"\n\n\"Every time Michael Cohen spoke to me, he gave a sense of urgency,\" Farro said, according to official transcripts of his testimony, which occurred over parts of two days. \"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly.\"\n\nThe events that landed Farro in the witness seat started with a phone call from Cohen on Oct. 26, 2016. That was 19 days after the emergence of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which then-candidate Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing and groping women, and 13 days before the election.\n\nCohen wanted to set up a bank account for a limited liability company -- Essential Consultants LLC -- that he had established nine days earlier. And he wanted to do so quickly.\n\n\"When Mr. Cohen called me, I was on a golf course, I know that's very cliche for a banker,\" Farro testified. \"But I was on a golf course on a day off.\"\n\nOf course, Cohen had to provide various pieces of information so that the bank could do its due diligence before the account could be opened.\n\nThe bank's know-your-customer form stated the following, based on the information that Cohen provided to First Republic: \"Michael Cohen is opening Essential Consultants as a real estate consulting company to collect fees for investment consulting work he does in real estate deals.\"\n\nThat assertion turned out to be false. The paperwork did not say anything about the true purpose of the bank account.\n\nIf Cohen had given any indication of the adult entertainment angle, \"Well, we would certainly ask additional questions,\" Farro said. \"It's not our money to determine where it goes. However, it is an industry that we do not work with.\"\n\nThe paperwork also did not include any suggestion that the account would be used to help a political candidate. If there had been such a disclosure, Farro said, \"There would be additional scrutiny.\"\n\nIt took only five or six hours to get the Essential Consultants account approved and ready to fund. \"Moving in and opening an account in a singular day is considered very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nJust four minutes before the 3 p.m. cutoff for wire transfers, Cohen moved $131,000 from a home equity line of credit that he already had at First Republic to the newly established Essential Consultants account.\n\nThe next morning, on Oct, 27, 2016, Cohen authorized a $130,000 wire transfer from the Essential Consultants account to an account for clients of Daniels' attorney, Keith Davidson. The purpose of the payment was characterized in paperwork as a \"retainer.\"\n\nDuring Farro's testimony on Tuesday, Assistant District Attorney Rebecca Mangold asked: \"Would the bank's process for approving the wire be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the wire transfer was a payment to an adult film star?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Farro responded. \"There would definitely be enhanced due diligence on that.\"\n\nFarro also testified that it's not atypical for a real estate transaction to be completed in a compressed period of time. Between Cohen's initial call to Farro on the golf course and the wire transfer to Daniels' attorney, only about 24 hours elapsed.\n\nWhen it was Trump attorney Todd Blanche's turn to question Farro, he asked whether First Republic may have failed to do appropriate due diligence. \"I don't know if that's a fair statement,\" Farro replied.\n\nIn January 2018, that Cohen used Essential Consultants to pay $130,000 to Daniels.\n\nFirst Republic ultimately decided to close certain accounts controlled by Cohen, Farro testified. \"We chose not to be attached to what we consider to be negative press,\" he said.\n\nHe also testified that media coverage was what alerted the San Francisco-based bank to the true nature of the transactions Cohen had made back in October 2016.\n\n\"Well, once the client does not be completely honest with us, we choose not to do business with them going forward,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nationalmortgagenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National

(Oh, and he's running for president.) To make it easier to follow along, each Monday we'll be looking back at all the Trump trial-related developments you might have missed the previous week.\n\nOn Monday, a New York Supreme Court justice found that Trump has once again violated his gag order and warned he could be jailed if this keeps up. Last week, the hush money trial attracted some big names in Trump's orbit who listened in on the historic proceedings. Meanwhile, the defense is pursuing a new delay tactic in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case.\n\nKicking the week off strong, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan ruled Monday morning that Trump had violated his gag order for the 10 time since the hush money trial began three weeks ago. He also threatened to hold Trump in jail if he keeps the violations going.\n\nMerchan's gag order prevents Trump from publicly speaking about jurors, witnesses, or family members of prosecutors and the judge himself in a way that could reasonably lead to threats. Yet, last week, as he walked out of a separate court hearing for another set of gag order violations, Trump gave a TV interview in which he insulted his former lawyer Michael Cohen, a critical witness in the ongoing hush money trial. \"Michael Cohen is a convicted liar, and he's got no credibility whatsoever,\" he ranted.\n\nThat interview, along with other comments Trump made about Cohen to reporters, led prosecutors to ask for further contempt charges against the former president. Merchan ultimately ruled that calling Cohen a \"convicted liar\" was protected political speech but fined Trump an additional $1,000 on Monday after the previous $9,000 for comments he made \"targeting the jury as 95 percent Democrats.\"\n\nIn court Monday, Merchan warned Trump directly, in the harshest terms yet, that continued violations could result in much more severe punishment. \"The magnitude of a such a decision is not lost on me, but at the end of the day I have a job to do, and part of that job is to protect the dignity of the judicial system,\" Merchan said. \"So, much as I do not want to impose a sanction [of jail] and I have done everything I can to avoid doing so, ... I will if necessary.\"\n\nTrump's behavior here isn't all that surprising -- he also violated the gag order in his civil fraud case multiple times, earning $15,000 in fines. A former White House lawyer for the Trump administration told Politico that this is a targeted strategy to delegitimize the legal battles Trump faces.\n\nWhen FBI agents raided Mar-a-Lago two years ago, they seized 33 boxes containing 11,000 documents. And as prosecutors sifted through all that paper for special counsel Jack Smith's classified documents investigation, some of those documents got shuffled out of their original order.\n\nSmith's team said as much in a court filing last week, after a lawyer for Walt Nauta -- a co-defendant in the classified documents indictment -- asked for a delay in the case because he could not find the documents prosecutors were referring to. That's because when FBI agents came across any classified documents during their raid at Mar-a-Lago, they replaced them with a \"classified cover sheet.\" However, they found so many classified documents that they quickly ran out of cover sheets and instead used blank sheets of paper on which they hand-wrote each document's classification level.\n\nMost of the handwritten cover sheets were replaced, but some were left in the seized boxes, complicating efforts to link placeholders with their corresponding classified document. However, Smith's team also digitally scanned each classified document that it seized and created an FBI index code linking each scanned document to the box from which it had been retrieved. \"Nauta, therefore, has had access to this information, as well as the physical boxes, for nearly ten months,\" wrote Smith.\n\nAlthough the special counsel argued that the shuffling of seized classified documents did not merit a delay in Nauta's case, Trump believes otherwise. In a post to his Truth Social account, Trump called Smith's court filing an admittance of \"blatant Evidence Tampering by mishandling the very Boxes they used as a pretext to bring this Fake Case.\" And, unsurprisingly, Trump asserted that this mishap mandates \"that this whole Witch Hunt be DROPPED IMMEDIATELY.\"\n\nHicks, the former White House communications director for the Trump administration, took the witness stand last week. When she discussed her time working for the former president, she became visibly overwhelmed.\n\nHicks' testimony added to the chorus of people close to Trump who have confirmed that in the run-up to the 2016 election, Cohen paid adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair. Her testimony also shed light on how Cohen is viewed within the former president's inner circle. \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks testified. He's \"the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nWhen the defense started to cross-examine Hicks, she began to cry, prompting the court to take a 10-minute break. It's not clear what precisely brought on the tears, as Slate's Jeremy Stahl noted in a dispatch of the day's court proceedings. When she resumed her testimony, she confirmed that she had had a conversation with Trump the day after the New York Times reported that Cohen confessed to making a hush money payment to Daniels. \"President Trump was saying that he had spoken to Michael and that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him and that's what he was doing.\"\n\nKeith Davidson, a former attorney of Daniels' who represented her in the early days of the hush money scandal, also testified for the defense last week. And in the courtroom, some familiar faces showed up to the proceedings, including Trump's adult son Eric, Trump nemesis George Conway, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. (Eric returned to the courtroom Monday.)", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shirin_ali@slate.com", "name": "Shirin Ali", "type":

Trump's Monday began with a grave warning from Juan M. Merchan, the judge presiding over the former president's criminal trial, threatening to imprison him if he continued to flout a gag order.\n\nJustice Merchan said that the fines levied against Mr. Trump -- $10,000 so far -- \"are not serving as a deterrent.\"\n\nThe judge said that \"therefore, going forward, this court will have to consider jail.\"\n\nThat warning preceded a desert-dry description of a $130,000 payment made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to a porn star to buy her silence about her story of a one-night stand in 2006. That testimony was elicited from two employees, one current and one retired, of the Trump Organization.\n\nThe former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up that $130,000 payment. Mr. Trump, 77, the first American president to face criminal prosecution, has denied the charges and says he did not have sex with the woman, Stormy Daniels. If convicted, he could face prison time or probation.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's 12th day on trial:\n\nTrump's comments continue to bring him trouble.\n\nJustice Merchan once again found Mr. Trump in contempt for violating his gag order that prohibited attacks on jurors, witnesses, court staff and others. It was Mr. Trump's 10th violation, and resulted from an April 22 interview in which he said the jury was from \"a purely Democrat area,\" calling those circumstances \"very unfair.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/06/multimedia/06trump-trial-takeaways-bwql/06trump-trial-takeaways-bwql-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540922", "eventUri": "eng-9540922", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 1458, "textEnd": 1466}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 452726658, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 229, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 229}}}

goalless draw against Preston North End.\n\nLeeds struggled to break down a very well organised Preston side for the first hour and a goalkeeper in good form then denied them after the visitors had been reduced to ten-men.\n\nPreston chased and harried Leeds into making mistakes for the first hour as the home side struggled to test Chris Maxwell in the Preston goal.\n\nPreston midfielder Ben Pearson was the influence for the visitors, as he snapped into every tackle, winning the battle in midfield, but the game changed when he was sent off just after the hour.\n\nThe sending off changed the game in Leeds favour with Preston now sitting back and trying to frustrate the home side and a mixture of great goalkeeping from Maxwell and gamesmanship from the Preston side, who took every opportunity to wind down the clock, left Leeds frustrated and Christiansen admitted it was a tough game.\n\n\"The result was a little bit like the performance, we could have done better and if we had, we would surely have taken the three points,\" Christiansen told the Leeds United official website.\n\n\"In the end, we kept a clean sheet which is important and took a point, we played against a very good team who were organised and last week took three points from Sheffield Wednesday.\n\n\"It wasn't easy, we needed to move the ball faster, we didn't have the rhythm in the game to break Preston down.\n\n\"Preston were really compact and if you don't move them, you don't create the spaces, we needed to be quick and without it, it is difficult to open anybody in this division.\n\n\"All of the games in this league are very tough, you can't be a favourite before the game, you have to prove it on the pitch.\n\n\"I would have liked to have secured the three points, but we have to take the one and of course we didn't lose.\"\n\nChris Wood had Leeds best chance to win the game. The New Zealand international striker, found himself one-on-one with Maxwell after a sublime ball from Pablo Hernandez but the Preston goalkeeper denied the striker his second goal of the season.\n\nSubstitute Samu Saiz, who scored a hat-trick in midweek, was then found by a sublime cross but his weak header was easy for Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell then produced a great double save to deny Stuart Dallas and then Hernandez from the rebound.\n\nWith Leeds going all out for the win, they were almost caught out in injury time but they were relieved to see Josh Harrop's effort come back off the crossbar.\n\nVital Leeds are the proud sponsors of the Thames Valley Whites Regional Supporters club\n\nThe fastest growing Leeds United supporters club in the South of England, with over 200 members since its formation in April 2009, travel to all games home and away.\n\nThe branch has pick up points at Reading, Didcot, Abingdon, Oxford, Bicester and Banbury and will consider other pick up points on request.\n\nVital Leeds is now available on both facebook and twitter, so if you are that way inclined and more importantly understand all this new fangled dangled stuff, feel free to watch us, poke us or whatever else you are meant to do there!\n\nVital Leeds on:\n\nVital Leeds on:\n\nJoin Vital Leeds\n\nIt's easy to REGISTER HERE, simply click the link and enjoy getting involved!", "timeCrawl": "08:09:00", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2009-04-", "textStart": 2781, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2791}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8888579", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I felt the defenders were afraid to pass the ball back to him in the first half and they kept playing themselves into trouble by trying to take the ball out of defence.\n\nAyling 7\n\nA typical Ayling performance. He was very strong in the first half in a tough battle down the Leeds right. He tried to give Leeds an attacking outlet at every opportunity in the second half following the sending off.\n\nJansson 5\n\nHe looked a yard off the pace having not featured in the opening two games. He got very lucky on a couple of occasions with poor decisions.\n\nCooper 7\n\nAnother strong defensive performance from Cooper. Some of his distribution was poor though and he got very lucky on one occasion with one poor ball out of defence.\n\nBorthwick-Jackson 7 Star Man\n\nI thought he had a very good game both defensively and in the attack. He put in two or three excellent crosses that deserved to have someone on the end of them.\n\nPhillips 6\n\nHe struggled to get a grip on the game in midfield but he kept battling hard.\n\nO'Kane 6\n\nLike his central midfield partner, he struggled to get a grip of the midfield battle and we were second best until the sending off.\n\nHernandez 6\n\nHe struggled to make any impression on the game until the sending off.\n\nRoofe 5\n\nHe was starved of the ball for most of the game and he was eventually replaced. I was not sure why they switched him and Alioski halfway through the first half.\n\nWood 6\n\nHe had a great chance to win the game for Leeds but the Preston keeper thwarted him. One of those afternoons where he was just missing getting on the end of some good crosses.\n\nAlioski 6\n\nHe was our bright spark in the first half and he had one good run that saw him drag a shot wide. He was frustrating towards the end of the game when he tried to go down the line when he would have been better cutting in on his left foot.\n\nSubs\n\nVieira 7\n\nHe made a big difference after coming on and it would have been interesting to see how he had done against Pearson.\n\nSaiz 7\n\nHe was heavily involved after coming on and he was at the heart of most things Leeds did. He had one great chance with a header late on but could only make a weak contact. I would start him in midweek.\n\nDallas 6\n\nHe came on for the final ten-minutes and he offered an outlet down the left. He came close to scoring when Maxwell denied his headed effort.\n\nSummary\n\nA frustrating afternoon for Leeds. Preston look very organised under Alex Neil and they will be a hard team to beat this season. Ben Pearson dictated the game in the Preston midfield until his sending off. He could quite easily have had three yellow cards and a straight red before eventually being sent off. He was the main architect in frustrating Leeds.\n\nHis sending off was a major turning point. Leeds really should have gone on to win the game following his dismissal. Preston keeper Chris Maxwell made a number of good saves and as the game wore on, we became guilty of trying to walk the ball into the net. Preston took every opportunity to wind down the clock. They were bad enough before the sending off. They came with a plan and it worked well. Teams are going to come to Elland Road this season to frustrate us so we have to work a way of breaking them down. They snapped into every challenge whilst we had no pace and no invention to work a way of breaking them down.\n\nI would have taken four points from two games in the first week of the season.

Borthwick-Jackson urged Leeds United to see a 0-0 draw with Preston North End as a small step towards the play-offs as attention at Elland Road turned to Tuesday night's clash with Fulham.\n\nLeeds failed to take advantage of a 60th-minute red card shown to Preston midfielder Ben Pearson and were rescued by the crossbar in the dying moments of a goalless encounter on Saturday.\n\nThe result at Elland Road maintained United's unbeaten start to the season but Borthwick-Jackson, who made his league debut after a loan move from Manchester United last week, described the draw against 10-man Preston as \"frustrating\".\n\nChris Wood failed to convert a golden second-half chance after being played clean through by Pablo Hernandez and Hernandez saw a late effort saved by goalkeeper Chris Maxwell but Leeds rode their luck in injury-time when a shot from North End substitute Josh Harrop cannoned off the bar.\n\nBorthwick Jackson said: \"We should have got three points but a point is valuable as the season goes on. A point can be crucial to picking up play-off (places) and a point is better than nothing.\n\n\"You get these frustrating games and they were out for a draw towards the end as we pushed for the win. You have to take advantage (of Preston being down to 10 men) but as the game went on they had their game plan and it worked for them.\"\n\nLeeds will contest the third of three home matches in a week - the first a League Cup win over Port Vale last Wednesday - when Fulham come to Elland Road.\n\nThe West London club, who dramatically beat United to a Championship play-off position in the final month of last season, have opened their campaign with back-to-back draws and will be without suspended defender Tomas Kalas after he was sent off in the first minute of their visit to Reading on Saturday.\n\n\"Everyone is frustrated but we have to bounce back Tuesday and pick up three points,\" Borthwick-Jackson said. \"I think this is a promotion-winning squad here and that's what the aim is for this season.\n\n\"Everyone has gelled well, training's competitive and everyone's trying to make everyone else better players.\"\n\nBorthwick-Jackson arrived from Old Trafford a week ago, taking up the second loan of his fledgling career after a spell with Wolverhampton Wanderers last season.\n\nThe 20-year-old started against Preston after first-choice left-back Gaetano Berardi was lost to a dislocated shoulder in a 3-2 win over Bolton Wanderers on the first weekend of the new term.\n\nBorthwick-Jackson, who revealed he had picked up a minor injury towards full-time, was influential in the closing stages, spraying in crosses from the left wing as Leeds attempted to break down Preston's rigid defence.\n\n\"I grew into the game as it went on and it was frustrating to get a little niggle towards the end,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel I can bring more to the team and I'm 110 per cent dedicated to Leeds for the season. I'll do all I can.\n\n\"Obviously there's a rivalry between the clubs (Leeds and Manchester United) but I'm a Leeds player and I am going to work as hard as I can to get this team where they should be.", "timeCrawl": "17:02:00", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8943989", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "id": 714, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

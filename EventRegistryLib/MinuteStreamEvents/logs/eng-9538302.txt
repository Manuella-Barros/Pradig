He's been in party mode ever since winning his third Super Bowl ring, and the party continued in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tight end hit up Sports Illustrated's Revel at the Races bash at the Ice House on Friday ahead of the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby. Kelce was there to see his friends, The Chainsmokers, and he spent the evening dancing with his group at an exclusive table for the majority of the night.\n\nThe star-studded event also included A-list attendees like New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and his former Green Bay Packers teammates -- Davante Adams, A.J. Hawk, Jimmy Graham and David Bakhtiari.\n\nThe entire bunch are likely to attend Saturday's big race at Churchill Downs. No sign of Kelce's teammate, Patrick Mahomes, in Louisville. Then again, Mahomes has already gone on the record to say he can't keep up with the Kelce brothers when it comes to painting the town red.\n\n\"No, I cannot [keep up with the Kelce brothers]. I used to, I think, and then I had kids,\" Patrick quipped during an appearance on Logan Paul's Impaulsive podcast.\n\nTravis' trip to the Derby City comes not long after he and his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, visited Las Vegas for a fundraising gala for Patrick and Brittany Mahomes' 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. Kelce auctioned off a set of four tickets for Swift's Eras Tour. The surprise contribution raised a whopping $80,000 for charity.\n\nAn eyewitness previously told ET that Swift and Kelce walked in to the gala \"holding hands and were affectionate all night.\" The event goer adds that throughout the night, there was \"lots of kissing and just overall happiness between them. The support is there for one another.\"\n\nKelce has a lot to celebrate these days.

He's been in party mode ever since winning his third Super Bowl ring, and the party continued in Louisville, Kentucky, where he celebrated hitting his first bet at the famed racetrack.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby's official Instagram account on Saturday shared video of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end celebrating after winning his first bet at Churchill Downs for the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby. You can see he's dripping in style with an off-white, pinned stripe, double-breasted suit. He finished the look with a fedora hat.\n\nThe night prior, Kelce hit up Sports Illustrated's Revel at the Races bash at the Ice House. He was there to see his friends, The Chainsmokers, and he spent the evening dancing with his group at an exclusive table for the majority of the night.\n\nThe star-studded event also included A-list attendees like New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and his former Green Bay Packers teammates -- Davante Adams, A.J. Hawk, Jimmy Graham and David Bakhtiari.\n\nThe entire bunch are likely to attend Saturday's big race at Churchill Downs. No sign of Kelce's teammate, Patrick Mahomes, in Louisville. Then again, Mahomes has already gone on the record to say he can't keep up with the Kelce brothers when it comes to painting the town red.\n\n\"No, I cannot [keep up with the Kelce brothers]. I used to, I think, and then I had kids,\" Patrick quipped during an appearance on Logan Paul's Impaulsive podcast.\n\nTravis' trip to the Derby City comes not long after he and his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, visited Las Vegas for a fundraising gala for Patrick and Brittany Mahomes' 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. Kelce auctioned off a set of four tickets for Swift's Eras Tour. The surprise contribution raised a whopping $80,000 for charity.\n\nAn eyewitness previously told ET that Swift and Kelce walked in to the gala \"holding hands and were affectionate all night.\" The event goer adds that throughout the night, there was \"lots of kissing and just overall happiness between them. The support is there for one another.\"\n\nKelce has a lot to celebrate these days. Not only is he dating the world's biggest pop star but he also recently signed a record-breaking contract extension with the Chiefs that'll pay him $17 million fully guaranteed. The two-year deal is worth $34.25 million, making him the highest-paid tight end in the league.

Taylor Swift\n\nIn footage shared on the Kentucky Derby's official Instagram account, the 34-year-old can be seen jumping up and down and celebrating after sweeping up an early windfall.\n\nThe video included the captions: 'When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits' and '@killatrav off to a hot start at the Kentucky Derby'.\n\nKelce was celebrating his winning wager in an owners suite at Club Sports Illustrated at Churchill Downs, having also attended SI's pre-Derby party the night before.\n\nTravis wasn't the only NFL-related figure in attendance, nevertheless, with

hearing them play his girlfriend's song, before singing along and pumping his fists in the air.\n\nHe also changed the lyrics in the song to 'are you in love with me?' before Swift was later heard

He looked fittingly dapper for the iconic horse racing event in a white pinstriped double-breasted suit with a blue dress shirt and a dark colored tie. He accessorized with a feather-trimmed hat.\n\nIn a clip posted on the official Kentucky Derby Instagram account, Kelce could be seen clapping and jumping up and down as he took in the action on the race track. It seems he had a big reason to be so excited, as text over the video read, \"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits.\"\n\nThe post was captioned: \"@killatrav off to a hot start at the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nAhead of the equestrian event, Kelce hung out with The Chainsmokers in what appeared to be a backstage area at the musicians' Kentucky Derby gig at the Ice House on Friday, May 3. The performance was part of the Sports Illustrated Revel at the Races concert.\n\nIn a photo posted on Alex Pall's Instagram Stories, the athlete posed with a friend, who appeared to be retired NBA star Chandler Parsons. Kelce was also photographed inside the venue, mingling and laughing with other guests.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby, established in 1875 and run annually on the first Saturday in May, is now nearly 150 years old. The event always draws a large crowd, with nearly 150,000 attending last year's races -- more than the 2024 Super Bowl, which Kelce and the Chiefs won this year.\n\nKelce certainly knows how to party -- and according to his friend and Kansas City Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes, it's almost impossible to keep up with him nowadays.\n\nDuring an interview on Logan Paul's Impaulsive podcast, Mahomes, 28, told Paul about how much harder it has been to keep up with the Kelce bros when they party now that he is a father of two.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nMahomes said, \"No, I cannot [keep up with the Kelce brothers]. I used to, I think, and then I had kids. You hear my voice now and I left early every night [when they were in Las Vegas for his charity golf tournament and gala]. ... You gotta pick and choose these days.\"\n\nNotably absent from the Kentucky Derby was Kelce's girlfriend, Taylor Swift. Swift, also 34, is currently gearing up for the international leg of her blockbuster Eras Tour in Paris.\n\nPEOPLE recently confirmed that the \"Anti-Hero\" singer will also not attend the Met Gala on Monday, May 6. Instead, she'll focus on rehearsals and tour prep ahead of her upcoming Eras Tour dates.

They were there to watch Alex Pall and Andrew Taggart, better known as the Chainsmokers, perform as part of the Revel at the Races concert organised by Sports Illustrated.\n\nAfter the Chainsmokers' set, Kelce made sure to catch up with Pall, who later shared a photo of them together on his Instagram story.\n\nThis isn't the first time Kelce has been seen having fun with the Chainsmokers. When the Kansas City Chiefs clinched Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas, Kelce and the Chiefs were spotted celebrating with Pall and Swift.\n\nREAD MORE: Aaron Rodgers makes incredible offer to New York Jets rookie after NFL Draft\n\nREAD MORE: San Francisco 49ers claim they won't trade Brandon Aiyuk to anyone in blow for rivals\n\nWhile in Sin City, the crowd was delighted when Kelce heartily sang along to Taylor Swift's smash hit \"You Belong With Me,\" cheekily altering the lyrics to \"Are you in love with me? \" This gesture melted Swift, who told a reporter it was \"the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me,\" according to the Daily Mail.\n\nPost his shenanigans at Kentucky Derby, the NFL superstar is headed to Miami for the hotly-anticipated Miami Grand Prix where he is expected to link up with Swift again. Here he'll join fellow Alpine F1 Team celebrity owners such as quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, pro golfer Rory McIlroy and Hollywood A-lister Ryan Reynolds.\n\nWith celebrities like Kelce, Mahomes and more present to cheer, Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon will have a lot to prove following the NFL stars' investments. The two have had a slow season start this 2023-24, with their best ranks being only 13th and 11th respectively.\n\nTravis Kelce was spotted enjoying himself at the 150th Kentucky Derby before heading to Miami to watch F1\n\nMoreover, team Alpine hasn't managed to bag any points in the Constructors' Championship so far, sharing bottom places with Williams and Kick Sauber. In stark contrast, supremacy continues to be conferred upon Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez of Team Red Bull. After just five races, they've accumulated an impressive tally of 209 points.\n\nVerstappen's flawless start to the season hit a snag at the Australian Grand Prix, where he failed to finish. Instead, Ferrari's dynamic duo Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc clinched first and second place, with McLaren's Lando Norris taking a respectable third.\n\nFor Kelce, the Miami event marks another highlight in an already thrilling off-season.

The Kentucky Derby was this weekend and saw a number of celebs in their true Derby best. It was big hats galore, bringing a fun, southern charm to the horse race. The true talk of the event though was Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who showed up to the event solo and in his best suit. The look was a blast from the past, igniting some fun takes from fans on his dapper appearance.\n\nLately, Travis Kelce has seemingly been everywhere, embarking on outings with girlfriend Taylor Swift. Kelce and Swift even attended Coachella together and were recently spotted together at a fundraising event for Patrick Mahomes. However, this weekend, Kelce made a statement on his own while attending the Kentucky Derby. He totally understood the assignment, showing up in a pinstripe, double breasted white suit and a fedora. You can see a video of his look from the official Kentucky Derby TikTok below:\n\nOf course, fans on X had some hilarious takes on the outfit, with one suggesting Travis Kelce should get into the horse racing game himself and give it a name that reflects his podcast with brother Jason Kelce:\n\nAnother X user thought the NFL player looked great, and his enthusiasm for the event made the whole thing even better:\n\nWhile the race was the main event, the Super Bowl winner certainly made an entrance with the look and the police escort. Taylor Swift fans certainly approved of the fashion moment, with one using the handle @corneliastagain saying:\n\nThe references to Kelce's famous significant other were rampant, with one joking that the football player was wearing Swift's \"22\" hat from the eras tour, which she usually gives away to a fan each concert. They said on X:\n\nFans were definitely excited to see the footballer rocking this fit, but many missed seeing Swift by his side. Another Swiftie, @thisisvertrying, said\n\nFor context, the Eras tour is starting up again in Paris next week following Taylor Swift's hiatus from touring for a few months. Gearing back up for an epic tour like Eras is no easy feat and, while the \"Love Story\" singer likely would've loved to accompany her boyfriend to a fun event like The Kentucky Derby, she is hard at work. I couldn't help but notice the athlete's suit is the same color scheme as Swift's latest album that dropped two weeks ago, The Tortured Poets Department, which garnered reactions from various fans. This could be a coincidence, but Swift loves an Easter egg, and I wouldn't be surprised if her boyfriend also wanted to get in on the fun.\n\nIt's nice to see Travis Kelce is enjoying his own time off, as the NFL season doesn't start up again until August.

Kelce was spotted in the Bluegrass State on Friday. Accompanied by former NBA star Chandler Parsons, Kelce appeared in a photo shared on Alex Pall's Instagram Stories, with Pall being one half of the Chainsmokers. Pall also disclosed their attendance at Sports Illustrated's Revel and the Races party through a separate post.\n\nThe following day, Kelce was photographed at the Kentucky Derby, exuding sophistication in a tan suit paired with a light blue dress shirt, a navy blue fedora, and a matching tie. As he made his way through Churchill Downs in Louisville, he was flanked by bodyguards and police, creating quite a stir captured on social media.\n\nKelce's renowned girlfriend, Taylor Swift, was notably absent from the event, with reports suggesting her private plane jetted off to Paris. Swift's Eras Tour is poised to resume on May 9 in the romantic City of Love.\n\nSpeculation had been rife recently about whether the high-profile couple would attend the 150th annual horse race or opt for the Miami Grand Prix in Florida over the weekend.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, in a recent segment, drew parallels between Swift, also 34, and the Kentucky Derby, marveling at the success of her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, which has broken records.\n\n\"I feel like Taylor Swift, at this point, if she wanted to, could win the Kentucky Derby,\" the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" host had jokingly said in his April 30 monologue.\n\nWhile Swift and Kelce have not attended the event in previous years, Swifties were \"manifesting\" an appearance on X.\n\n\"taylor and travis showing up to the kentucky derby would be a fever dream,\" one social media user tweeted.\n\nKelce and Swift's relationship traces back to the summer of 2023, with their romance taking off during a Kansas City Chiefs game they attended together in September of that year. Swift continued to stand by Kelce's side, even joining him on the field for a celebratory Super Bowl kiss in February.\n\nThroughout Swift's Eras Tour, Kelce reciprocated the support by making multiple appearances. During their respective offseasons and breaks from touring, the couple garnered attention with affectionate outings in various locales, including the Bahamas and California.\n\nTheir most recent public display of affection occurred during Patrick Mahomes' charity event in Las Vegas, where eyewitnesses observed the couple being affectionate. Not only did they appear deeply in love at the gala on April 28, but Swift's fans speculate she also cheered Kelce on at a golf tournament earlier that same day.", "source": {"uri": "screenbox.in",

It's about being able to contribute to a sport that demands precision, teamwork and relentless pursuit of success,\" Kelce added. \"I am looking forward to this new chapter and can't wait to see what we achieve together.\"\n\nThough Swift was not in attendance, she recently sparked fan theories that she made a reference to Formula 1 in her song \"imgonnagetyouback,\" which was released as part of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, in April.\n\nAll the Famous Names Taylor Swift Drops on 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\n\"Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did,\" Swift sang on the second verse of the track. \"I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch / Then ran and hid.\"\n\nSome fans believed Swift was alluding to her rumored 2023 romance with Formula 1's Fernando Alonso, who has been driving for Team Aston Martin since last year. Alonso, 42, subsequently reacted to the lyrics in a TikTok video, holding a finger over his lips as Swift sang the Aston Martin line.

She has been on hiatus from the international leg of her Eras Tour since March and will return to the stage in Paris on Thursday, May 9, while Kelce has been in the NFL offseason since the Kansas City Chiefs' February Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn March, the pair took a romantic vacation to The Bahamas, and in April, they were spotted at the 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California. Later in the month, Swift and Kelce reunited with Patrick and Brittany, 28, at a charity auction for the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation in Las Vegas, where Swift donated tickets to the Eras Tour that

He arrived in a crisp white pinstriped suit with a white-collared light blue shirt underneath. He paired it with dark designer tie and topped it with a dark grey hat. It was a perfect fit and befitting someone who is a reigning Super Bowl champion.\n\nHe was accompanied by security as he made his way among the crowd as others tried to get a peek. Thankfully, you don't have to stand on your tiptoes to see how Travis Kelce looked as we have the photos right here.\n\nIs Taylor Swift also at the Churchill Downs joining Travis Kelce for the Kentucky Derby?\n\nTravis Kelce was spotted alone with no information about his partner, Taylor Swift. She is expected to be busy preparing for The Eras Tour, which returns with a performance in Paris next week.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that the Super Bowl-winning tight end did not rub shoulders with some music royalty at the Kentucky Derby. Prior to arriving at the Churchill Downs, Travis Kelce rubbed shoulders with 'The Chainsmokers', who also performed at the Chiefs' Las Vegas party after they lifted the Lombardi Trophy this past February. Alex Pall, one half of the duo, posted a picture of the NFL star on Instagram.\n\nThese are the last few days he can enjoy before he gets back to the grind of professional football. Even during this weekend, while he enjoys the Kentucky Derby at the Churchill Downs, some rookies are expected to be at their three-day minicamps, which happens either May 3 - 6 or May 10 - 13.\n\nThe Chiefs are looking for an unprecedented third title in a row and know it will be harder than ever before. Last season, even without a stellar cast of receivers, they managed to crack the code to winning and much of their success was owed to the veteran tight end.\n\nKansas City does have a new speedy receiver in Xavier Worthy and he has already invited comparisons to former Chiefs wideout, Tyreek Hill. But there is no certainty with a rookie and Patrick Mahomes might have to depend on his trusted tight end once again.\n\nAnd with all the pressure on Travis Kelce, it is only fitting that he enjoys the offseason just as he was doing today at Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rit_nanda@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Rit Nanda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vince Lombardi Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chainsmokers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Chainsmokers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreek_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyreek Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller_Skating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller Skating", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/97859-17148572236910-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "dateEnd": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1554, "textEnd": 1563}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "dateEnd": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 1567, "textEnd": 1578}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The caption read, \"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits,\" signaling a victorious start to Kelce's Derby experience.\n\nThe celebration for Kelce began even before the main event, as he attended Sports Illustrated's Revel at the Races concert featuring The Chainsmokers at the Ice House on May 3.\n\nKelce, who has been in a celebratory mood since clinching his third Super Bowl ring, mingled with guests and was photographed enjoying the night. The event was buzzing with famous faces, including retired NBA star Chandler Parsons and noteworthy attendees such as Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams, among others.\n\nNotably absent from Kelce's side was his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, who is currently preparing for the international leg of her Eras Tour in Paris. Despite Swift's absence, Kelce's weekend in Louisville was anything but solitary, filled with festivities, friendships, and, of course, fashion.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby continues to be an event where sports and entertainment intersect, drawing nearly 150,000 attendees.

A Kelce social media fan page shared a video of his event 'fit on X, formerly Twitter, after the Kansas City Chiefs tight end's arrival.\n\nIn the video, Kelce kept his gaze focused ahead of him as he walked into the event space. He struck a casual look by wearing a Kelly green button-down patterned T-shirt and matching shorts. He also wore a black baseball cap with white lettering backward on his head, relying on his dark sunglasses to keep the glare out of his eyes.\n\nThough it was rumored that the NFL player would attend the event with Taylor Swift, his pop star girlfriend was nowhere in sight when he arrived.\n\nAnother clip shared via Instagram by the BWT Alpine F1 Team showed Kelce enjoying a snack at the Miami Grand Prix while pointing to his hat and interacting with the camera.\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\nKelce's attendance at the Formula 1 event continued a weekend of sports outside of football for the three-time Super Bowl champion. On Saturday, Kelce was spotted in the crowd at Churchill Downs as more than 156,000 people gathered to watch the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nLike the Miami Grand Prix, Kelce attended the Derby without Swift, who is preparing to resume her international Eras Tour later this week. The European leg of her hit tour kicks off on May 9 in Paris.\n\nDespite fans' disappointment that Swift wasn't on Kelce's arm for his fun weekend of visits to Kentucky and Florida, many were still excited to see Kelce's fashion picks for the events-especially the white pinstripe suit he wore to watch the Running of the Roses.\n\nThe smitten couple has enjoyed quite a few date nights lately, including a PDA-packed night at Coachella and, more recently, a glamorous appearance at fellow Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes' charity event in Las Vegas last weekend. Swift and Kelce have seemingly squeezed in as much time off together as possible before the Grammy winner's return to the stage.\n\nNext: Taylor Swift Sends Strong Message to Fans Before Returning to Eras Tour\n\nCopyright 2024 The Arena Group, Inc.

The-34 year-old was spotted in a striking white suit and dark fedora, taking in the sights without his superstar girlfriend, Taylor Swift.\n\nReports suggest that Kelce was partying with ex-NBA player Chandler Parsons at the Ice House on Friday night. They were there to watch Alex Pall and Andrew Taggart, better known as the Chainsmokers, perform as part of the Revel at the Races concert organised by Sports Illustrated.\n\nAfter the Chainsmokers' set, Kelce made sure to catch up with Pall, who later shared a photo of them together on his Instagram story.\n\nThis isn't the first time Kelce has been seen having fun with the Chainsmokers. When the Kansas City Chiefs clinched Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas, Kelce and the Chiefs were spotted celebrating with Pall and Swift.\n\nREAD MORE: Aaron Rodgers makes incredible offer to New York Jets rookie after NFL Draft\n\nREAD MORE: San Francisco 49ers claim they won't trade Brandon Aiyuk to anyone in blow for rivals\n\nWhile in Sin City, the crowd was delighted when Kelce heartily sang along to Taylor Swift's smash hit \"You Belong With Me,\" cheekily altering the lyrics to \"Are you in love with me? \" This gesture melted Swift, who told a reporter it was \"the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me,\" according to the Daily Mail.\n\nPost his shenanigans at Kentucky Derby, the NFL superstar is headed to Miami for the hotly-anticipated Miami Grand Prix where he is expected to link up with Swift again. Here he'll join fellow Alpine F1 Team celebrity owners such as quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, pro golfer Rory McIlroy and Hollywood A-lister Ryan Reynolds.\n\nWith celebrities like Kelce, Mahomes and more present to cheer, Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon will have a lot to prove following the NFL stars' investments. The two have had a slow season start this 2023-24, with their best ranks being only 13th and 11th respectively.\n\nMoreover, team Alpine hasn't managed to bag any points in the Constructors' Championship so far, sharing bottom places with Williams and Kick Sauber. In stark contrast, supremacy continues to be conferred upon Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez of Team Red Bull. After just five races, they've accumulated an impressive tally of 209 points.\n\nVerstappen's flawless start to the season hit a snag at the Australian Grand Prix, where he failed to finish. Instead, Ferrari's dynamic duo Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc clinched first and second place, with McLaren's Lando Norris taking a respectable third.\n\nFor Kelce, the Miami event marks another highlight in an already thrilling off-season. It could also be the last time he joins Swift - should she attend - at a public event for a while. The pop superstar is set to kick off the European leg of her \"Eras Tour\" on May 9 in France.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Despite claims that the 'Shake It Off' singer would grace the event, she was nowhere to be seen in south Florida.\n\nKelce joined his Kansas City Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes, who was spotted soaking up the atmosphere in the paddock on Saturday with wife Brittany. The couples had reportedly planned to enjoy some quality time together in Miami.\n\nUSWeekly had claimed on Tuesday that Swift would be seen at the Miami race, taking another step in her budding friendship with Brittany. But as it turned out, Swift gave the race a miss, leaving Kelce to attend on his own.\n\n\"Brittany is thrilled to be building a genuine friendship with Taylor,\" USWeekly revealed back in October 2023. \"They've hung out a couple of times and have grown fairly close in a short period of time. Brittany thinks Taylor is so sweet and down to earth and they get along really great.\"\n\nFollowing a private getaway to the Bahamas and a trip to Coachella, where Swift and Kelce enjoyed some alone time, the two power couples reunited on Tuesday at Mahomes' '15 and Mahomies Foundation Golf Classic. ' Despite Kelce's clear affection, a body language expert told The Mirror exclusively that the couple seemed 'out of sync'.\n\nA jam-packed weekend for the two star-studded couples saw Kelce flying solo to the prestigious Kentucky Derby, donning a dapper blue fedora and an off-white sport coat, mingling with former NBA celebrity Chandler Parsons and the famed pop duo the Chainsmokers. Over in Miami, the Mahomes were spotted getting cosy at the swanky Sexy Fish restaurant after a day watching the Sprint race and qualifying, with insiders dishing to Page Six that \"they were seen canoodling at the table, kissing and hugging\".\n\nWhile Kelce was making waves at the Grand Prix on Sunday, Taylor Swift's private jet touched down in France the previous night, as the chart-topping singer gears up to continue her Eras Tour in Paris come May 9. Despite being apart, the Chiefs tight end was all smiles, sharing a business venture with Mahomes that includes big names like Ryan Reynolds and Rory McIlroy as fellow investors in the Alpine F1 Team.\n\nHowever, sources whisper that Swift is finding the distance from Kelce tough to handle. \"It makes the prospect of her tour more challenging. She'll be sad,\" confided an insider to USWeekly in late April.\n\n\"They deepened their bond [during] all the time they've spent together recently. They support and respect [each other]. They have busy careers, so they understand those commitments, as difficult as it is.\"\n\nFollowing a brief break from her gruelling tour, Swift is set to hit the road again with 16 gigs lined up within a month starting May 9. This relentless schedule will continue until her performance at London's Wembley Stadium on August 20th.\n\nBy then, her beau Kelce and his teammate Mahomes will have already started their Chiefs training camp on July 23, as they aim for a third consecutive Super Bowl win.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While he was walking, a passerby handed him the bracelets, which are worn by Taylor Swift fans and exchanged during her Eras Tour.\n\n\"You're too kind. Thank you very much,\" Kelce said as he accepted the bracelets. \"I wish had one to give back,\" he added.\n\nAnother fan approached Kelce to get a photo clicked, but he politely declined, saying, \"It's nice to meet you though, brother,\" and gave the fan a friendly fist bump.\n\nKelce attended the race in Miami on Sunday without Swift. According to the reports, Swift had returned to Europe over the weekend ahead of her Eras Tour, which kicks off in Paris on May 9.\n\nKelce looked dapper in a casual green ensemble. He finished the look by opting for Alpine Racing hat and sunglasses. Kelce had a busy weekend, starting with his arrival in Kentucky on Friday night to attend the derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville on Saturday.\n\nKelce sported a different look from his Sunday appearance. He donned a stylish tan suit paired with a light blue dress shirt, a navy blue fedora, and a matching tie.\n\nLast weekend saw Swift and Kelce jetting off to Las Vegas, where they enjoyed time with friends Patrick and Brittany Mahomes.

But as it turned out, Swift gave the race a miss, leaving Kelce to attend on his own.\n\n\"Brittany is thrilled to be building a genuine friendship with Taylor,\" USWeekly revealed back in October 2023. \"They've hung out a couple of times and have grown fairly close in a short period of time. Brittany thinks Taylor is so sweet and down to earth and they get along really great.\"\n\nFollowing a private getaway to the Bahamas and a trip to Coachella, where Swift and Kelce enjoyed some alone time, the two power couples reunited on Tuesday at Mahomes' '15 and Mahomies Foundation Golf Classic.

Over in Miami, the Mahomes were spotted getting cosy at the swanky Sexy Fish restaurant after a day watching the Sprint race and qualifying, with insiders dishing to Page Six that \"they were seen canoodling at the table, kissing and hugging\".\n\nPatrick Mahomes and wife Brittany were also in Miami with Alpine Travis Kelce was filmed in the Alpine F1 team area before the Miami Grand Prix\n\nWhile Kelce was making waves at the Grand Prix on Sunday, Taylor Swift's private jet touched down in France the previous night, as the chart-topping singer gears up to continue her Eras Tour in Paris come May 9. Despite being apart, the Chiefs tight end was all smiles, sharing a business venture with Mahomes that includes big names like Ryan Reynolds and Rory McIlroy as fellow investors in the Alpine F1 Team.\n\nHowever, sources whisper that Swift is finding the distance from Kelce tough to handle. \"It makes the prospect of her tour more challenging. She'll be sad,\" confided an insider to USWeekly in late April.\n\n\"They deepened their bond [during] all the time they've spent together recently. They support and respect [each other]. They have busy careers, so they understand those commitments, as difficult as it is.\"\n\nFollowing a brief break from her gruelling tour, Swift is set to hit the road again with 16 gigs lined up within a month starting May 9. This relentless schedule will continue until her performance at London's Wembley Stadium on August 20th.\n\nBy then, her beau Kelce and his teammate Mahomes will have already started their Chiefs

I wish I had one to give back.\"\n\nKelce's teammate, Patrick Mahomes, and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, were also in attendance at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nAlthough not photographed together, their appearance at the high-profile event is presumably related to their recent investment in Alpine Racing, a Formula One racing team.\n\nSunday's event comes on the heels of Kelce's stylish appearance at the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday.\n\nKelce looked appropriately chic in a pinstripe, double-breasted suit and a stylish charcoal fedora.\n\nHe also won big on his first bet of the day, as seen in a video posted by the Kentucky Derby's Instagram account.\n\nKelce's trip to the Derby City comes not long after he and his girlfriend visited Las Vegas for a fundraising gala for Patrick and Brittany's 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. Kelce auctioned off a set of four tickets for Swift's Eras Tour. The surprise contribution raised a whopping $80,000 for charity.\n\nAn eyewitness previously told ET that Swift and Kelce walked in to the gala \"holding hands and were affectionate all night.\" The event goer added that throughout the night, there was \"lots of kissing and just overall happiness between them. The support is there for one another.\"\n\nKelce's appearances at the Kentucky Derby and the Miami Grand Prix also comes after he recently signed a record-breaking contract extension with the Chiefs that'll pay him $17 million fully guaranteed. The two-year deal is worth $34.25 million, making him the highest-paid tight end in the league.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_bracelet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Friendship bracelet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Autodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Autodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fedora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-05/Travis_Kelce_GettyImages-2071884643_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He wore a platinum watch and earrings and topped off the look with a dark fedora that held a light blue feather on the side.\n\nAfter walking the red carpet, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end made it to his seat to watch the jockeys take their places on the starting line. Per a video shared by the official Kentucky Derby Instagram account, Kelce got excited when his first race bet came to fruition.\n\nKelce enthusiastically jumped up and down screaming when he saw how his horse did on Saturday. \"That's how we do it,\" he added. \"Woo!\"\n\nKelce's Derby celebrations kicked off one day earlier when he hit up Sports Illustrated's \"Revel at the Races\" Louisville party on Friday, May 3. He donned a mint button-down with white embroidery, mingling with fellow attendees including The Chainsmokers singer Alex Pall.\n\nBoth Friday and Saturday outfits further solidify Kelce's style prowess.\n\n\"Travis has a clear vision for his personal aesthetic and definitely styles himself,\" his stylist, Danielle Salzedo, exclusively told Us Weekly in November 2023. \"I know what he likes, and I find him options with brands we know are his vibe -- while also looking for new ones yet to be discovered.\"\n\n\"He dedicates time to buying online, so he knows what's out there and what's new,\" Salzedo told Us. \"He spends a significant amount of time on different retail and designer sites looking for new pieces and shopping. He's bought pieces before we can even contact the brand to secure the items.\"\n\nKelce puts the same level of emphasis into his style for game days -- he is the star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs -- or on the red carpet.\n\nWhile Kelce appeared at the Kentucky Derby solo, he's recently been enjoying quality time with girlfriend Taylor Swift during his NFL offseason.

Notably absent was his renowned girlfriend, Taylor Swift.\n\nAccording to reports, Kelce was seen reveling alongside former NBA player Chandler Parsons at the Ice House on Friday evening.\n\nThe duo attended the Revel at the Races concert, headlined by the electronic music duo known as the Chainsmokers, as part of the weekend's celebrations organized by Sports Illustrated.\n\nFollowing the electrifying performance by the Chainsmokers, Kelce ensured to catch up with Alex Pall, one-half of the duo, as they shared a moment captured and shared on Pall's Instagram story.\n\nTravis Kelce's camaraderie with the Chainsmokers is well-documented. During the Kansas City Chiefs' triumphant Super Bowl LVIII victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas, Kelce and his team were seen reveling in the celebration alongside Alex Pall of the Chainsmokers and his partner, Taylor Swift.\n\nDuring their time in Sin City, Travis Kelce delighted the crowd by passionately singing along to Taylor Swift's chart-topper \"You Belong With Me,\" playfully tweaking the lyrics to \"Are you in love with me?\"\n\nSwift, touched by the gesture, reportedly confided to a reporter that it was \"the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me,\" as detailed.\n\nFollowing his Kentucky Derby escapades, the NFL sensation is set to make his way to Miami for the highly-anticipated Miami Grand Prix, where he is anticipated to reunite with Swift once more.\n\nThere, he will join other notable celebrity owners of the Alpine F1 Team, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his spouse Brittany, professional golfer Rory McIlroy, and Hollywood luminary Ryan Reynolds.\n\nWith high-profile celebrities such as Kelce and Mahomes in attendance to show their support, Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon will undoubtedly feel the pressure to deliver following the significant investments from these NFL stars.\n\nThe duo has experienced a sluggish start to the 2023-24 season, with Gasly's best finish placing him 13th and Ocon achieving only an 11th place, highlighting the need for improvement as they strive to elevate their performance on the track.\n\nMoreover, team Alpine hasn't managed to bag any points in the Constructors' Championship so far, sharing bottom places with Williams and Kick Sauber.\n\nIn stark contrast, supremacy continues to be conferred upon Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez of Team Red Bull. After just five races, they've accumulated an impressive tally of 209 points.\n\nVerstappen's flawless start to the season hit a snag at the Australian Grand Prix, where he failed to finish. Instead, Ferrari's dynamic duo Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc clinched first and second place, with McLaren's Lando Norris taking a respectable third.\n\nFor Kelce, the Miami event marks another highlight in an already thrilling off-season. It could also be the last time he joins Swift - should she attend - at a public event for a while. The pop superstar is set to kick off the European leg of her \"Eras Tour\" on May 9 in France.", "source": {"uri": "otakukart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OtakuKart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl champ and his girlfriend Taylor Swift both know how to have fun. Whether they're together or apart, they always appear to be enjoying life. Recently, the duo hit Las Vegas together and appeared to have a blast. However, later, the NFL star ditched his world-famous leading lady in order to head out to the club and live it up. Now, Kelce is leaving Swift behind again as he parties at the Kentucky Derby.\n\nKelce was spotted in Kentucky for the big horse race. He also dressed to the nines for the event. TMZ reports that the athlete sported a white pin-strip suit with black tie, hat, and pocket square. However, he showed up to the festivities alone. Swift was noticeably absent from the fun. It's not unthinkable that the singer would want some downtime before heading back out on her Eras tour later this month. She did just get back from Vegas with her man. However, recent reports suggest something could be off between the duo.\n\nDuring Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's appearance at the Patrick Mahomes charity gala in Las Vegas, their body language was concerning. Expert Judi James tells The Mirror that the pair seemed to be out of sync during their trip to Sin City.\n\n\"Travis and Taylor look rather out of sync in this moment, James said. \"She's in a formal evening gown complete with clutch bag and she is talking to someone else at the event. This is not Super Bowl Taylor clutching a beer and acting like a fan. It looks like a more formal, elegant, and polite Taylor who is still arriving or 'doing the room,'\" she continued.\n\nIt's unclear if Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are having relationship issues. However, fans are hoping that the singer just stayed home to rest up before her career takes her away from the United States and her boyfriend yet again.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodnewsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood News Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-40.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Updates on if star couple is at Churchill Downs", "body": "There is no sporting event quite like the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe annual race at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky brings out all the stops en route to delivering what has been dubbed as the greatest two minutes in sport. From extravagant hats to unique alcoholic beverages, the Kentucky Derby never fails to deliver.\n\nWith the event being so high profile, it's not shocking to see there are a number of A-list celebrities confirmed to be attending the race. Among those VIPs are popular sporting figures such Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Raiders wide receiver Davante Adams.\n\nHowever, when you are talking about the most popular celebrities, we would be remiss not to mention arguably the most notable couple in 2023/2024 -- Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The international singer-songwriter and the Chiefs star tight end have been populating headlines dating back to September, and there is a chance they find themselves the talk of the town yet again this weekend.\n\nWill Kelce and Swift be at Churchill Downs for the 2024 Kentucky Derby? The Sporting News has the latest reports and updates on their status.\n\nMORE: Horses, odds, expert picks & more for 2024 Kentucky Derby\n\nThere have been no reports about a potential appearance from Swift or Kelce at the 2024 Kentucky Derby.\n\nWhile the race at Churchill Downs may be considered the premier spectacle on the weekend, it is not the only high-profile sporting event. The F1 season continues on, with the series shifting to the United States for Saturday and Sunday with the Miami Grand Prix scheduled.\n\nThere have been reports that Kelce and Swift could be in South Beach to attend the race. The Chiefs tight end is an investor in the Alpine F1 team, along with his teammate Patrick Mahomes, PGA golfer Rory McIlroy and actor Ryan Reynolds.\n\nThe NFL offseason is in full swing, so Kelce has plenty of time on his hands to watch motor racing. For Swift, she has a break in her Eras Tour schedule, which picks back up again on May 9 over in Europe, with the next leg of her concerts set to be held in France.\n\nWhile plenty of A-list celebrities have attended the Kentucky Derby, there is no evidence that Swift has ventured to Churchill Downs to watch the greatest two minutes in sports.\n\nSimilarly to Swift, there is no evidence that Kelce has watched the Kentucky Derby in person before.\n\nLast year was arguably the best chance for the Chiefs tight end to catch the action at Churchill Downs. Mahomes was selected as the 2023 \"Riders Up\" caller, an honor that the race track instituted in 2012 for a special celebrity.\n\nMahomes was at the 149th edition of the event with his wife, Brittany, but his partner-in-crime on the field was nowhere to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davante_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davante Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Beach", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Beach"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-02/Untitled%20design%20-%202024-02-07T113459.364.png?itok=WDbf3zfq", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1987, "textEnd": 1992}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It was quite a different look from the pinstripe suit and fedora he wore one day prior at the Kentucky Derby in Louisville.\n\nNews broke in October 2023 that Kelce and Patrick, 28, joined the investment group supporting the Alpine Racing Formula 1 team, with Kelce noting in a statement at the time that he was \"thrilled\" about the opportunity.\n\n\"Our shared passion for excellence and innovation forms the cornerstone of this partnership. It's about being able to contribute to a sport that demands precision, teamwork and relentless pursuit of success,\" Kelce added. \"I am looking forward to this new chapter and can't wait to see what we achieve together.\"\n\nThough Swift was not in attendance, she recently sparked fan theories that she made a reference to Formula 1 in her song \"imgonnagetyouback,\" which was released as part of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, in April.\n\n\"Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did,\" Swift sang on the second verse of the track. \"I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch / Then ran and hid.\"\n\nSome fans believed Swift was alluding to her rumored 2023 romance with Formula 1's Fernando Alonso, who has been driving for Team Aston Martin since last year. Alonso, 42, subsequently reacted to the lyrics in a TikTok video, holding a finger over his lips as Swift sang the Aston Martin line. Swifties on social media were quick to note hat Kelce was wearing Aston Martin green on Sunday.\n\nAmid the hype surrounding The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has been enjoying time off with Kelce. She has been on hiatus from the international leg of her Eras Tour since March and will return to the stage in Paris on Thursday, May 9, while Kelce has been in the NFL offseason since the Kansas City Chiefs' February Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn March, the pair took a romantic vacation to The Bahamas, and in April, they were spotted at the 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California. Later in the month, Swift and Kelce reunited with Patrick and Brittany, 28, at a charity auction for the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation in Las Vegas, where Swift donated tickets to the Eras Tour that raked in $80,000.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_crabtree@usmagazine.com", "name": "Erin Crabtree", "type": "author",

They have won three Super Bowls together and been through heartbreaking defeats. Recently, Mahomes had to defend his teammate and friend from his own girlfriend, Taylor Swift. Swift has just released a new album titled The Tortured Poets Department. Although most songs are about her ex-boyfriends Matty Healy and Joe Alwyn, there are a few that may be about Travis Kelce.\n\nAccording to Page Six, in Taylor's song \"So High School,\" the singer says, \"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle.\" Many fans of Travis could see this as a backhanded compliment by Swift. However, that is where Mahomes comes into play. Patrick was quick to defend his friend by saying that he is actually very intelligent.\n\n\"He puts on this persona, I'm partying, drinking, whatever, but he's really super intelligent,\" Mahomes, 28, said.\n\nMahomes admits that Kelce is a huge party boy and that he can no longer keep up with him. However, he still knows his teammate is a smart man. Other than just being athletic, Kelce is a football genius. It is a huge reason why the Kansas City Chiefs have dominated season after season.\n\nOn the other hand, another song from Taylor Swift's newest album praises Travis Kelce's ability to be one of the best tight ends in the game. \"These blokes warm the benches. We've been on a winning streak,\" sings Taylor on \"The Alchemy.\"\n\nEveryone knows how good Travis Kelce is on the field. Patrick Mahomes knows that all too well. However, Kelce is still capable of having intelligent conversations. Travis is not just some dumb jock. Taylor and Travis are still thriving, though. The couple are spending every second together before their careers call them away from each other once again.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trevor_swerlein@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Trevor Swerlein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alwyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Alwyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Travis-Kelce-New-Heights-Patrick-Mahomes-Jimmy-Kimmel-Live.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

He was not accompanied by Taylor Swift, despite rumors she would be his date for the evening at the racetrack. He was seen in photos taken by TMZ with the fellas from the Chainsmokers and in a photo with the Houston Rockets' player Chandler Parsons. Late night host Jimmy Fallon shared a clip of them chatting on Instagram as well.\n\nHe was later seen in more casual wear at the Sports Illustrated Revel at the Races party at Ice House.\n\nIt's not too surprising that Swift wasn't at the Derby. The couple also turned down an invite for the Met Gala on Monday, because Swift's Eras Tour resumes in Paris on May 9 and she was planning to travel. She is most likely already on her way to Europe in preparation for her first concert or getting ready at home.\n\nThe official Kentucky Derby Instagram account shared a clip showing Kelce celebrating after winning a bet on a race, which they captioned, \"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Kentucky Derby (@kentuckyderby)\n\nWhen asked if he'd be attending any European tour dates, Kelce told Entertainment Tonight, \"You know I gotta go support.\"\n\nHe went on, \"We're both very career driven, we both love what we do, and so any chance that I can show my support to her and knowing that she's shown me all the support in the world throughout the season, it's just been an amazing experience getting to know Tay...She's so amazing at what she does, and to find that creativity, to see where she likes to pull things from and really just how she listens to music, is really very eye opening for me.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nThe 15 Best Organic And Clean Shampoos For Any And All Hair Types\n\n100 Gifts That Are $50 Or Under (And Look Way More Expensive Than They Actually Are)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aimee_lutkin@aol.com", "name": "Aim\u00e9e Lutkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chainsmokers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Chainsmokers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Fallon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tallinn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tallinn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hair"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller_Skating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller Skating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_elle_846/374dc5a16eed0bae9d6aefe9d90b2bc9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 876, "textEnd": 881}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

According to fans, the look appeared to mimic the ensemble that Swift, also 34, had worn several months earlier at the Grammys.\n\nSwift kicked off her Tortured Poets Department era at the February awards show, rocking the red carpet in a white, strapless Schiaparelli gown with matching black gloves and a choker necklace. (After winning big at the Grammys, Swift announced LP TTPD, which has a moody academic vibe. The album dropped on April 19.)\n\nSocial media fans immediately flocked to X to note the similarities between the two outfits.\n\n\"Is that Travis Kelce? Are you going to be on the next Taylor Swift album? LMAO,\" one social media user wrote as another joked that Kelce was wearing Swift's \"22\" hat from her Eras Tour.\n\nA third fan posted a side-by-side of the two outfits, jokingly writing, \"They look like they're about to set sail on the Titanic.\"\n\nSwift appeared at the Grammys solo as Kelce was gearing up for the Super Bowl one week later. However, he was still able to watch her victory moment -- and red carpet strut -- on television. (Swift and Kelce have been dating since summer 2023.)\n\n\"It was fresh,\" Kelce told reporters of her red carpet outfit at his pre-Super Bowl press conference. \"It's all about accessories when you go to an awards show like that. She killed it.\"\n\nKelce similarly rolled up unattached to the Kentucky Derby. Swift is currently getting ready to travel to Paris for the next leg of concerts on her Eras Tour.\n\nSwift kicked off her live tour -- her first in four years -- in March 2023.

In October 2023, he and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes became investors in the Formula 1 team Alpine Racing, who are competing in the Grand Prix.\n\nThe two teammates, through Kelce's management company A&A Management, became the lead investors in an ownership group -- which also includes four-time golf champion Rory McIlroy and Olympic boxing gold medalist Anthony Joshua -- that secured a $218 million investment in Alpine Racing, venture capital group Otro Capital announced at the time.\n\nIn a statement, Kelce said the partnership with his friend Mahomes, 28, and the \"world-class\" private equity firm is a \"dream come true.\"\n\nRelated: Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes Invest in F1 Alpine Racing Team: 'Dream Come True'\n\n\"We are embracing this opportunity to be a part of something extraordinary, and we look forward to contributing our passion and commitment to this incredible team,\" Kelce said.\n\n\"As athletes, we understand the importance of teamwork, dedication and the pursuit of excellence,\" Mahomes added at the time. \"We see these same qualities in Alpine Racing and are excited to be a part of their journey to further success.\"\n\nMahomes also attended the Grand Prix with his wife, Brittany Mahomes, who wore a summery pink-and-white gingham minidress for the occasion.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nKelce's appearance at the Grand Prix comes just days after NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported that the tight end had agreed to extend his contract with the Chiefs for two more years.\n\nThe extension is worth more than $17 million a year, making Kelce the highest-paid tight end in the league. Kelce's longtime agent, Mike Simon, negotiated the deal, the financial details of which were not immediately disclosed.\n\nPatrick took a moment to congratulate Kelce on his record-breaking contract extension, writing in a post on X (formerly Twitter): \"I told yall I'll never let him leave!!

Since her Eros Tour went on hiatus and the NFL is in the off-season, the couple are taking a much-deserved break from their work and have enjoyed a vacation to the Bahamas, time spent in Swift's Los Angeles mansion, and a pop-in at Coachella.\n\nMost recently, the power couple was spotted in a Las Vegas nightclub with Kelce's teammate Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, during a weekend golf fundraiser for Mahomes' foundation. A gift of four tickets to Swift's massively profitable Eras Tour raised $80,000 for 15 and the Mahomes Foundation, which supports improving the lives of children.\n\nIn 2023, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes were guests of Patricia Barnstable Brown at her illustrious Kentucky Derby Eve Gala. The following afternoon on Saturday, Mahomes announced \"Riders Up\" on the NBC Sports broadcast moments before the start of the 149th Kentucky Derby. It's possible the Mahomes passed along how much fun he had on Kentucky Derby weekend in Louisville and inspired his friends to book a trip.\n\nIt's worth noting that the 2024 Met Gala is scheduled for Monday, May 6 and Swift has her next international Eras Tour performance in Paris on May 9.\n\nSo, will we see the power couple?

record producer Steve Stoute, chef Mario Carbone, NBA star Jordan Clarkson and BMX athlete Nigel Sylvestre.\n\nA number of other celebrities were at the party, according to Page Six.\n\n\"Mahomes caught up with LeBron [James], Kevin Durant and a few others and he was very playful,\" a source told the publication.\n\n\"He was truly having a great time and people naturally gravitated towards him.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Kelce attended the Miami GP as a guest of the Alpine F1 team, which he is an investor in.\n\nKelce wore a green shirt-and-shorts set, sunglasses, a black baseball cap and black sneakers.\n\nFans were most pumped to see Travis at the event though, and shared their excitement on social media.\n\n\"He looks ready to both of his team's cars fall backwards all race,\" a third fan said.\n\n\"A matching set and a backwards hat, my two favorite Travis things,\" a fourth fan said.\n\nMahomes and Kelce invested in Alpine late last year as part of a new investment group.\n\n\"I think everybody can see the appeal,\" Mahomes said.\n\n\"I've been able to get to a couple races now, seeing the environment, and then obviously watching the (Formula 1:) Drive to Survive on Netflix you see how competitive it is.\n\n\"Any time you get an opportunity to get in on that, I mean I'm as competitive as anyone can get, so hopefully it can open up to some great opportunities and we are able to go to some of those races and have a little stake in the game.\"\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday, Kelce attended the 150th Kentucky Derby wearing a stylish pinstripe suit and fedora.\n\nPictures of Kelce showed him being escorted by bodyguards and police through Churchill Downs in Louisville.\n\nNFL fans were impressed with the eight-time Pro Bowler and his attire

So why didn't Taylor Swift go?", "body": "You need a flight tracker to keep up with these two.\n\nWe're of course referring to Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift who have logged more miles in the air than some professional pilots.\n\nSince their relationship started about seven months ago, they have gone literally to the ends of the earth to see each other and put in the work.\n\nThat's what made it so surprising to see Kelce go stag to two major events this past weekend.\n\nThe \"New Heights\" star was seen having a blast at the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday. The next day the NFL star, who's currently in his off season, was seen 1,000 miles away in Miami Gardens, whooping it up trackside at the Miami Grand Prix. And later that night, we heard the baller, who co-owns a racing team, was hobnobbing at the $3,000 a head Carbone Beach pop-up dinner.\n\nSo what's the deal? There were rumblings that Kelce and Swift, both 34, would attend F1 together. The pop star still has a few days left until resuming her Eras tour in Paris on Thursday. Maybe since the \"Love Story\" singer is a human being, she needs to rest, and we totally get that since these type of all day/all night festivities can be exhausting for some folks.\n\nKelce just has a passion for partying. A few days after attending Coachella with his famous girlfriend, he admitted to his brother Jason Kelce on their podcast that he basically craves fun.\n\n\"I really enjoy any event. I just like going to events, going where people are, seeing talents ... like, I just like to experience that type of s--t.\"\n\nWe do know that Swift had to be on his mind, though. In a video posted to ESPN's NFL Instagram page, a woman in the F1 crowd was seen handing him a friendship bracelet, which he graciously accepted.\n\n\"You're too kind. Thank you very much,\" said Kelce, who offered Swift such a trinket with his number on it in order to meet her back in the day. \"I wish I had one to give back.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeleine_marr@miamiherald.com", "name": "Madeleine Marr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Gardens,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coachella (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.kentucky.com/latest-news/tphub5/picture288314340/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/LEX_240504Kelce20.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The NFL player also changed the lyrics in the chorus as he sang, \"Are you in love with me?\" instead of singing, \"You belong with me.\"\n\nAccording to the caption in the video, band frontman Andrew Taggert had said to Kelce, \"I didn't know if I should play it or not.\" Kelce was then seen singing to a person off-camera, \"Are you in love with me?\"\n\nWhile it was not known if the person was his girlfriend, Swift, the singer was seen in another video from the moment shared by BFF Keleigh Teller on TikTok, pointing at Kelce, while singing along as the track played.\n\nIn another video

Fans were thrilled by Kelce's outfit choice for the event, which included a white pinstripe suit and a navy fedora that had a small blue feather stuck in its brim.\n\nThe NFL player arrived at the track in time to watch several horse races before the Run for the Roses Saturday evening. In a video that the Kentucky Derby's official Instagram account shared with fans, Kelce stood in the stands watching one race unfold, growing more and more excited as the horses neared the finish line.\n\nKelce started jumping up and down in excitement and turned around in a half-circle, seemingly pleased with the race's final result. He had a huge smile on his face as he celebrated the win.\n\nThe Derby's Instagram account added a text overlay to the video that read, \"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits.\" The video's caption tagged Kelce's account as it noted he was \"off to a hot start at the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nFans who reposted the video on social media shared their own reactions to the football star's excitement. One person explained on X, formerly Twitter, that Kelce was \"jumping up and down cause his first bet hit\" and added, \"that's a golden retriever lol.\"\n\n\"Excitement like a little kid. He and Taylor really are similar,\" another fan tweeted, referring to Kelce's pop star girlfriend, Taylor Swift.\n\nThough some fans were hopeful that the \"Cruel Summer\" singer would join Kelce at the Derby, he appeared to be there with friends. The Kentucky Derby, which is the first of three jewels in horse racing's Triple Crown, is taking place this year just days before Swift's international Eras Tour is due to resume in Europe.

Recently, Mahomes made waves in the racing world with his appearance at the Miami Grand Prix, accompanied by his wife Brittany. However, there was one face missing from the hospitality suite- Travis Kelce.\n\nLast year, Mahomes and his teammate Travis Kelce ventured into the world of Formula One, making a staggering $218 million investment in the Alpine F1 Team. As the racers suited up, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes graced the event in support of Alpine F1. The star quarterback wore a blue hoodie and shorts to flaunt the colors of his team, while Brittany showed up beside him in an orange mini-dress.\n\nLater, the ruling SB champion even reshared a video of the couple's appearance at Miami GP, with a caption with said,\n\n\"QUALI DONE, BACK TO HOSPITALITY.\"\n\nHowever, while Mahomes' support for his team elated many, Travis Kelce's absence had fans raising questions about his role in the venture. In fact, some even resorted to reacting on Alpine F1's official X post.\n\nWith fans anticipating another double date between the Mahomes and TNT, Travis Kelce's absence on race day did break a few hearts. Nevertheless, the younger Kelce brother has been making good use of his offseason and even made a lone appearance at the Kentucky Derby.\n\nTravis Kelce may have missed out on the Alpine F1 show, but he made a splash at the Kentucky Derby alongside Aaron Rodgers. As the iconic Churchill Downs set the stage for the Kentucky Derby, sports stars Travis Kelce and Aaron Rodgers infused the event with their charisma and style.\n\nTravis Kelce, the NFL standout known for his prowess on the football field, traded his jersey for a white dapper suit and a black derby hat, embodying elegance with his on-point choices. In a video that soon went viral on social media, Trav was seen celebrating his successful wager candidly amidst the Derby's glamorous atmosphere.\n\nInterestingly, Kelce was without his usual companion Taylor Swift, and instead allowed his infectious smile to make headlines. Alongside him, Rodgers cut a striking figure in sleek black attire, drawing attention and admiration from onlookers.\n\nWhile Kelce's absence from the Alpine F1 show may have surprised some, his participation in the Derby showcased the Tight End's magnetic energy and zest for life. Despite the absence of Swift, Kelce's charming demeanor stole hearts. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes stole the show at Miami GP with fans anticipating more of the NFL star power at future races.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anushree_gupta@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Anushree Gupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/b76bce0d-untitled-design.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, a photo shows Kelce amid a sea of attendees.\n\nThere has been speculation for months over whether the \"Shake It Off\" singer and her boyfriend would saddle up and attend the \"Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports.\"\n\nIt's no secret this A-list super couple doesn't shy away from having a good time so why not a trip to Churchill Downs for the annual \"Run for the Roses?\"\n\nWhen it comes to having a good time, Kelce and Swift are all in. Since her Eras Tour went on hiatus and the NFL is in the off-season, the couple are taking a much-deserved break from their work and have enjoyed a vacation to the Bahamas, time spent in Swift's Los Angeles mansion, and a pop-in at Coachella.\n\nMost recently, the power couple was spotted in a Las Vegas nightclub with Kelce's teammate Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, during a weekend golf fundraiser for Mahomes' foundation. A gift of four tickets to Swift's massively profitable Eras Tour raised $80,000 for 15 and the Mahomes Foundation, which supports improving the lives of children.\n\nIn 2023, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes were guests of Patricia Barnstable Brown at her illustrious Kentucky Derby Eve Gala. The following afternoon on Saturday, Mahomes announced \"Riders Up\" on the NBC Sports broadcast moments before the start of the 149th Kentucky Derby. It's possible the Mahomes passed along how much fun he had on Kentucky Derby weekend in Louisville and inspired his friends to book a trip.\n\nIt's worth noting that the 2024 Met Gala is scheduled for Monday, May 6, and Swift has her next international Eras Tour performance in Paris on May 9.\n\nSo, will we see the power couple together?

The two are enjoying some quality time together before the songwriter heads back out on her Eras Tour. Swift and Kelce were seen all around Vegas, thanks to Patrick Mahomes hosting his charity gala there. While in Vegas, Swifties gushed at the fact that Swift's bodyguard could relax when Travis arrived. The guard was even confident enough to pull out his phone.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, while leaving a highly acclaimed steakhouse, Travis was seen in \"protective mode.\" The images were studied by a body language expert who had come to that conclusion.\n\n\"After all his recent neck/shoulder-nuzzling and his graduation beer-swilling, Travis appears to be on his best behavior here for yet another date night with Taylor. He walks upright and in step beside her, smiling politely as she turns to talk,\" behavior expert Judi James said. \"Their hand-hold involves his on top encasing hers, suggesting he's still in protective mode, while that cardigan suggests he's trying to look like the boy you can take home to meet your parents rather than a Super Bowl wild man,\" she added.\n\nFans are all happy over how Travis Kelce always has Taylor Swift's safety as his top priority. Of course, they both still have security ready to intervene in any kind of issue. However, Travis Kelce seems to have things under control.\n\nThere was a moment recently that had fans scared when Travis went clubbing in Las Vegas alone, but it seems like Taylor was just at the hotel getting some rest. The couple is thriving as they continue to spend all of their time together.\n\nUnfortunately for them, Taylor Swift will have to head back out on tour soon, and Travis Kelce is also heading back to Kansas City for training camp. However, for now, the two are just focused on each other.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trevor_swerlein@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Trevor Swerlein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce-New-Heights-Anti-Hero.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

What time is Netflix's Tom Brady Roast and who might be in attendance?\n\nTravis Kelce was without Taylor Swift at the 2024 Kentucky Derby but he marked the 150th running of the famous horse race by staking a winning bet as the Kansas City Chiefs star continues to collect victories after winning Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe 34-year-old rocked up to the event in a smart white pinstripe suit coupled with a fedora that definitely flexed his wealth and looked good as he did so, and he actually left the event a little richer than when he arrived as he backed a horse for the win.\n\n\"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits, the official account of the race posted to Instagram. \"@killatrav off to a hot start at the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nThe Kentucky Derby is the first leg of the American Triple Crown series, followed by the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. The quest for the Triple Crown, which has only been achieved by a handful of horses, adds to the event's allure and excitement.\n\nKelce, despite the absence of his girlfriend, did find his friends though as he was seen hanging out with Jimmy Fallon, Chandler Parsons and The Chainsmokers in a small handful of the 150,000 crowd.\n\nThe NFL star certainly has a flair for the fun of life as he continues his sports career whilst pushing into television and now he's making sure he also catches some of the biggest events in the world.\n\nWith the Kentucky Derby now checked off his bucket list, Kelce might find himself jetting off to Florida to attend the 2024 Miami Grand Prix to watch Formula 1 cars carefully thread themselves through the street circuit at the Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nIt's far from unusual to see Swift and Kelce apart from each other as they both chase their high-demanding careers on their respective battlegrounds and it's this reason that Swift didn't attend the race.\n\nThe 34-year-old is preparing to resume her Eras Tour, which now heads to the European leg of its journey as she will perform in France on May 9 which is just a few days away.\n\nNo cause for concern, just someone who is remarkably dedicated to her craft.

Pity the poor woman he gently rebuffed, more than a couple of times, when she tried to snuggle close for a selfie.\n\nHe wore a custom suit by Sloan and Bennett, founded by former NBA player James \"Patrick\" Christopher and named after the two cross streets near his childhood home in Compton, California.\n\nThe luxury outerwear line combines \"1960s tailoring and 1990s athletics\" for garments made from Italian and French textiles, according to its website. Garments are lined with purple silk.\n\nOn Sunday, he joined the Mahomeses at the Miami Grand Prix where, the couple had already kicked off the weekend partying Friday with a familiar entourage of friends that included former Chiefs backup quarterback (now a Buffalo Bill) Shane Buechele and his wife, Paige Buechele.\n\nKelce and Patrick Mahomes attended as new co-owners of a Formula One team, Alpine Racing, which, by the way, did not win.\n\nWearing a white Dior T-shirt and Dior sneakers, Mahomes posed for photos with LeBron James on Saturday, delighting fans who loved seeing the two sports greats together.\n\nFor the race Sunday, Kelce ditched the formality of a double-breasted suit for his customary colorful casual wear.\n\nHe stood out in the celebrity-filled crowd wearing emerald green.\n\nAccording to the Instagram account Style by Kelce, he wore a Givenchy Hawaii shirt ($890) and matching shorts ($890) with Bottega Veneta sunglasses ($635) and \"Black Phantom\" Air Jordan 1 Low OGs, a Nike and Travis Scott collaboration that's sold out.\n\nInstead of a fedora, he wore a black Alpine F1 Team cap. The cap keeps selling out, which his fans discovered when he wore one during a \"New Heights\" podcast in February. The \"BWT Alpine F1 Team 2024 New Era Black Cap\" is $49.57 on Alpine's online store.\n\nBrittany stayed cool, and looking cool, during the race in a pink gingham Versace corset top ($1,790) and miniskirt ($1,290).\n\nPartying after the race, Kelce wore all white again in a Patchwork shirt ($235) and matching Patchwork trousers ($230) by KidSuper. He turns heads in this label.\n\nChiefs fans might recall the long, colorful, faux fur \"Fell in Love With the Dancer\" coat Kelce wore before a game in February 2022.\n\nBut Swifties will remember KidSuper's \"Bedroom Painting\" blue-and-white denim set Kelce wore when the Chiefs played at home against the Chicago Bears in September -- because it was the first game she attended.\n\nThat was a winning day for KidSuper's rising star designer Colm Dillane, too.\n\n\"The image of Mr. Kelce and Ms. Swift together quickly went viral and sparked immediate interest in Mr. Kelce's outfit,\" noted The New York Times.\n\nSwift's fans hoped to see her and Kelce on the red carpet Monday at the Met Gala in New York City. But by most accounts she is already in Paris, where she resumes her Eras Tour on Thursday.\n\nThere is no word yet, however, on whether the Mahomeses will follow up their Met Gala debut last year with

The Kansas City Chiefs tight end was spotted at the 2024 Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, May 4, as he jumped up and down in a crowd of people after winning a bet.\n\nThe clip shared by the official Kentucky Derby Instagram page showed Travis, 34, celebrating at Churchill Downs. Words on the clip read, \"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits.\"\n\nThe account captioned the post, \"@killatrav off to a hot start at the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs' official Instagram account commented on the clip and wrote, \"Winning at life tbh.\"\n\nThe NFL pro was dressed to the nines in a pinstripe suit and dark navy blue fedora for horse racing's biggest event of the year. While some fans hoped that girlfriend Taylor Swift would accompany Travis to the track, she was absent from the event.\n\nAnother photo of Travis at the event was shared on X. Several people on social media swooned at Travis' ensemble for the day with one X user comparing his look to that of Humphrey Bogart \"or maybe Indiana Jones.\"\n\n\"Put this man on the cover of GQ,\" read one comment, while another person added, \"I just love how he dresses! Not stuck in one style.\"\n\nTravis was also seen on Friday, May 3, as he mingled with guests and partied with The Chainsmokers after their performance at the Sports Illustrated Revel at the Races concert at the Ice House. A photo posted to The Chainsmokers' Alex Pall's Instagram Story showed Travis posing back to back with the DJ.\n\nThe Super Bowl Winner's arrival at the Kentucky Derby was a surprise for some as it was previously reported that Travis and Taylor, 34, would be spending time in Miami, Florida, at the F1 Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday, May 5. Many believed the couple might make a weekend trip of the event which wouldn't have left much time for a quick jaunt to Kentucky.\n\nHowever, multiple outlets reported that Taylor and Travis would be joining Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and wife Brittany for the Formula 1 event. Travis and his Kansas City Chiefs teammate became investors in the Alpine F1 racing team in 2023.\n\nIf Taylor does attend the F1 Miami Grand Prix, it will likely be her last public event before she resumes her Eras tour in Europe. The \"Cruel Summer\" songstress is set to return to the stage on May 9 in Paris, France.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The whole thing began when Kelce expressed disappointment that he couldn't give Swift a bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour.\n\nSwift and Kelce's romance blossomed and by September 2023, the singer was seen cheering on Kelce at NFL games. She avidly supported him throughout the 2023-2024 season, even attending Super Bowl LVIII where the Chiefs took home the championship.\n\nIn a December 2023 interview with TIME magazine, Swift revealed, \"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_bracelet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Friendship bracelet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Travis-Kelce1714977266-0/Travis-Kelce1714977266-0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

They've earned three Super Bowl rings together and have been in each other's lives as they go through personal milestones, such as Mahomes becoming a father and Kelce's high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift.\n\nSince Kelce became a household name thanks in large part to his relationship, he's garnered -- perhaps somewhat unfairly -- a reputation of not being bright. His unearthed misspelled tweets and apparent party boy personality have contributed to this image. But having seen Kelce in all kinds of settings, Mahomes defended Kelce's intellect and insisted that what fans see isn't the whole story.\n\n\"He puts on this persona -- I'm partying, drinking, whatever, but he's really super intelligent,\" Mahomes said in a May 2 interview on Logan Paul's Impaulsive podcast. Mahomes is 28 and Kelce is 34, but just because Kelce is older doesn't mean his partying days are behind him. When the Super Bowl MVP was asked if he can keep up with Kelce's partying, he simply stated \"No.\"\n\n\"I used to, I think, and then I had kids,\" he explained. He's a father to three-year-old daughter Sterling and one-year-old son Bronze with wife Brittany Mahomes.\n\nBecoming a father can certainly have an effect on a man's stamina.

Dan Patrick Delivers Candid Thoughts - The SportsRush", "body": "Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes. Picture Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn the wake of Travis Kelce's record-breaking contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs, valued at $34.25 million, the debate over his status as the team's primary figure has intensified. While many celebrate Kelce's well-deserved payday, sports radio luminary Dan Patrick offers a much different perspective.\n\nDuring a recent segment of his podcast on NBC Sports, Dan boldly posited that a new franchise face is on the rise in Kansas City. The spotlight on a team typically shines brightest on the quarterback, especially after multiple Super Bowl victories. However, Dan Patrick suggested that the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce, is stealing the limelight this time around.\n\n\"Has Travis Kelce become the face of the Kansas City Chiefs? And I would say yes because of everything off the field. Hosting Saturday Night Live, now dating Taylor Swift, he's got a personality. Got the number one podcast along with his brother and it feels like the tight end is the face of the franchise as opposed to the quarterback.\" Dan Patrick added.\n\nDan Patrick outlined several compelling reasons why Travis Kelce has emerged as the new face of the Kansas City Chiefs franchise. Firstly, Patrick notes that Kelce's high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift has elevated his personal brand, adding a charismatic personality to the team.\n\nMoreover, Kelce's off-field endeavors, including his widely famous podcast with Jason Kelce and recently getting to host Saturday Night Live, have kept the Chiefs in the spotlight beyond the football field.\n\nThe NBC sportscaster believes the dynamics have shifted, with Kelce now occupying a more prominent position as the face of the Chiefs compared to Patrick Mahomes.\n\nDuring the same segment of \"The Dan Patrick Show,\" the NBS Sports radio host also pondered whether Travis Kelce would earn the title of the greatest tight end of all time once he retires. Dan stressed, \"I think Travis Kelce will be viewed as the Greatest Tight End Of All Time.\"\n\nInterestingly, Dan Patrick isn't captivated by Kelce's stats, but rather his influence on and off the field. Moving on, Dan Patrick drew comparisons between Travis Kelce and two other legendary tight ends in NFL history: Tony Gonzalez and Rob Gronkowski.\n\nWhile reflecting on Gonzalez's career, Dan recognized his outstanding on-field accomplishments, comparing his stats to those usually seen in video games. However, despite his greatness, Gonzalez lacked the same level of popularity as Kelce. On the other hand, Dan noted that Gronkowski, while both great and popular, loses out in comparison to Kelce's level of impact and influence.\n\nKelce's prowess as a player is beyond question, especially evident in the Kansas City Chiefs' memorable journey to the Super Bowl in 2023, despite a somewhat shaky start to the season.\n\nThroughout the postseason, Kelce has truly shined, racking up an impressive 262 yards and three touchdowns on a remarkable 85.2% of his targets (23 of 27). Among his greatest efforts was an 11-catch, 116-yard effort against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game. Moments like these will cement Kelce's legacy as one of the NFL's all-time greats.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yagya_bhargava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Yagya Bhargava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(sportscaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gonzalez", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Gonzalez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Patrick_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Patrick Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/59fcfc88-yagya-fis-62.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

After later shows in Japan, Singapore and Australia, the Grammy winner had a hiatus throughout March and April.

The running back walked the red carpet in a white suit and sunglasses.\n\nAt a pre-Derby gala Friday night, Pacheco and Chiefs offensive linemen Creed Humphrey and Mike Caliendo walked a red carpet together, stylishly repping the Super Bowl winners at horse racing's most prestigious event.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday, more than 900 miles away in Miami, their quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, didn't need a red carpet either to grab attention as he and wife Brittany Mahomes arrived at the Miami Grand Prix ahead of Sunday's race.\n\nLast year Mahomes, Kelce and a group of other professional athletes became part owners of the Formula One Alpine Racing team.\n\nFans now hope to see Kelce cap a busy weekend by joining his fellow Formula One owner in Miami before possibly flying to Paris to join Swift on tour.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_gutierrez@kansascity.com", "name": "Lisa Gutierrez", "type":

If there's one thing we know about Travis Kelce, it's that he has style. The Chiefs tight end is known for his unique fashion tastes that he is not shy showing off at press conferences and other big events. Kelce made a recent appearance at the Kentucky Derby wearing another classic look.\n\nKelce showed up at the Kentucky Derby on Saturday wearing a white suit with a dark hat. We're not sure that the hat and suit complement each other, but Travis makes the fit work.\n\nSocial media did not waste much time before cracking a few jokes at Kelce's expense.\n\nOne person compared Kelce's fit to a Halloween gangster uniform\n\nPredictably, Kelce's flame Taylor Swift got brought into the conversation. One fan quipped that Taylor Swift would write a song about Travis' suit after the couple breaks up.\n\nTravis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs recently agreed to a two-year contract extension worth $34 million that will keep Kelce with the team through the 2025 season.\n\nThroughout his 11-year career, Kelce has caught 907 passes for 11,328 yards and 74 TDs. He has won three Super Bowls with the Kansas City Chiefs. In 2024, the Chiefs will attempt to become the first team in NFL history to win the Lombardi Trophy three years in a row.\n\nDid the Chiefs draft Travis Kelce's successor at tight end in Jared Wiley?\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs drafted tight end Jared Wiley out of TCU in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nTravis Kelce turns 35 in October, so it is logical to assume that the Chiefs have thought about a succession plan for the superstar tight end. Kelce is not done yet, but he can teach Wiley everything he knows about being a great NFL tight end over the next few seasons.\n\nBased on recent comments from Chiefs general manger Brett Veach, it is likely that Wiley gets to play in a rotational role in 2024.\n\n\"Travis is the best at what he does and [backup tight end] Noah Gray has done some really outstanding stuff for us the last few years,\" Veach said when asked about Wiley. \"Noah plays a ton of reps on special teams. Having another big body to be interchangeable with those two players is really important for us.\"\n\nWiley played the first three years of his collegiate career at the University of Texas. He transferred to TCU for his final two seasons and broke out in 2023. Wiley had 47 catches for 520 yards and eight TDs in his final season, all numbers that were more than double his first four seasons combined.\n\nWiley says he gained confidence in himself as his collegiate career progressed.\n\n\"I gained a lot of confidence in myself,\" Wiley said. \"There were a lot of times early in my career where I felt like I was kind of getting down on myself a little bit. All that went out the door these past two years, especially this last year, just having that confidence back in myself.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Wiley performs in his rookie season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_strauss@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ben Strauss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vince Lombardi Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU_Horned_Frogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TCU Horned Frogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Veach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Veach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Highway_Ends", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Highway Ends", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chiefs-news-Travis-Kelces-Kentucky-Derby-appearance-will-have-Taylor-Swift-writing-a-song-about-it.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The first slide includes a video of the It couple walking to a door while holding hands. Swift takes a moment to look back at something behind them while Kelce grabs the door for his leading lady. The two were also surrounded by personnel (presumably from the hotel or Swift's security).\n\nFor the evening out, Swift opted for a look that was distinct from her usual street style: a brown leather off-the-shoulder pleated micro-minidress. She styled the edgy frock with black pointed-toe pumps and a matching tiny brown handbag.

In a video shared by ESPN on Instagram, Kelce -- wearing a bright green shirt-and-shorts set, sunglasses, a black baseball cap and black sneakers -- could be seen taking the homemade jewelry as he walked past a crowd of people.\n\n\"You're too kind, thank you very much,\" he said to the young fan, adding: \"I wish I had one to give him back.\"\n\nKelce didn't just stop by the race track as a Formula 1 spectator. In October 2023, he and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes became investors in the Formula 1 team Alpine Racing, who are competing in the Grand Prix.\n\nThe two teammates, through Kelce's management company A&A Management, became the lead investors in an ownership group -- which also includes four-time golf champion Rory McIlroy and Olympic boxing gold medalist Anthony Joshua -- that secured a $218 million investment in Alpine Racing, venture capital group Otro Capital announced at the time.\n\nIn a statement, Kelce said the partnership with his friend Mahomes, 28, and the \"world-class\" private equity firm is a \"dream come true.\"\n\n\"We are embracing this opportunity to be a part of something extraordinary, and we look forward to contributing our passion and commitment to this incredible team,\" Kelce said.\n\n\"As athletes, we understand the importance of teamwork, dedication and the pursuit of excellence,\" Mahomes added at the time. \"We see these same qualities in Alpine Racing and are excited to be a part of their journey to further success.\"\n\nMahomes also attended the Grand Prix with his wife, Brittany Mahomes, who wore a summery pink-and-white gingham minidress for the occasion.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nKelce's appearance at the Grand Prix comes just days after NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported that the tight end had agreed to extend his contract with the Chiefs for two more years.\n\nThe extension is worth more than $17 million a year, making Kelce the highest-paid tight end in the league. Kelce's longtime agent, Mike Simon, negotiated the deal, the financial details of which were not immediately disclosed.\n\nPatrick took a moment to congratulate Kelce on his record-breaking contract extension, writing in a post on X (formerly Twitter): \"I told yall I'll never let him leave!!

with the Chiefs after they beat the San Francisco 49ers, but he had to flex alone.\n\nTaylor Swift was not in attendance as she prepares to resume her Eras Tour in Europe as she heads to Paris on May 6 to kick off a hectic schedule across the Atlantic Ocean, meaning she probably didn't pick this outfit out for her man.\n\nThe pair have been in a relationship since August 2023 but it's not uncommon for them to be apart due to their demanding schedules and that's something that the couple seems to be okay with.\n\nBut Kelce had a good time as he mingled with fans, friends and the crowd and he even managed to win a bet as he was captured enthusiastically celebrating his latest victory.\n\nIn fact, it's the fans who were quick to point out comparisons between the 34-year-old's dress sense and the attire worn by mobsters such as Al Capone, as they jokingly wondered if he's a part of the mafia.\n\nOne user commented on Instagram, \"Travis Kelce rolling up to the Kentucky Derby in a mob boss suit with security and police officers escorting him... your honor, he's slaying!!!!\"", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's nice to meet you, though,\" Kelce, 34, said in a TikTok shared by ESPN on Sunday, May 5, while at the 2024 Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix race.\n\nAs Kelce continued walking, he was stopped by a voice who said they had \"some friendship bracelets.\" Without skipping a beat, Kelce accepted the gesture and replied, \"Oh, you're too kind. Thank you very much. I wish I had one to give you back.\"\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tight end has been known to join in on the fun of swapping jewelry with fans even before he began dating Taylor Swift in summer 2023. (Fans of Swift, 34, are known for exchanging friendship bracelets during the pop star's performances as a reference to the lyrics of her Midnights track \"You're On Your Own Kid.\")\n\nKelce and Swift's romance, after all, began when the NFL star declared that he was unable to give the Grammy winner a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour show in July 2023.\n\n\"Well, I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\" Travis said during an episode of his and brother Jason Kelce's \"New Heights\" podcast at the time. \"So I was a little butthurt I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.\"\n\nAfter Jason, 36, asked what the bracelet was made of, Travis explained his intention. \"I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,\" he said.\n\nWhen Jason teasingly asked his brother if he was referring to the number on his Chiefs jersey, 87, Travis laughed, replying, \"You know which [number].\"\n\nBy September of that year, Swift was seen cheering on Travis as the Chiefs took on the Chicago Bears. She went on to attend 13 of his NFL games during the 2023-2024 season, including Super Bowl LVIII in February, which the Chiefs won.\n\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" Swift recalled during her TIME magazine interview in December 2023, noting that they \"started hanging out right after that.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_hudgins@usmagazine.com", "name": "Ryan Hudgins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_bracelet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friendship bracelet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Travis-Kelce-friendship-bracelet.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 126, "textEnd": 131}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Updates on if star couple is at Miami Grand Prix", "body": "While the 2024 Kentucky Derby may be the focal point of the sports weekend, things are going to be fast and furious down in South Beach.\n\nThe Miami Grand Prix is set for this weekend, as the F1 series heads to Florida following a successful trip to Shanghai last week for the Chinese Grand Prix. The event, which debuted in 2022, has quickly become one of the most popular racing events in the United States.\n\nThe spectacle is not just simply watching the race. As is tradition when in Miami, there are tons of parties and a plethora of celebrity sightings at the event. With F1 increasing in popularity in the country, its following is growing wider and wider as well.\n\nWhen it comes to famous couples, there is arguably none more notable right now than the power duo of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The international singer-songwriter and the Chiefs star tight end have been all over headlines dating back to September when the two were first tied together. Now, there is a good reason to believe the two will be in South Beach for the F1 race.\n\nWill Kelce and Swift be in Florida for the 2024 Miami Grand Prix? The Sporting News has the latest reports and updates on their status.\n\nMORE: Updated F1 driver and constructor points | Which driver has the most wins in F1 history?\n\nWhile nothing has been made official yet, there have been reports that Kelce and Swift could be in Miami to attend the F1 race this weekend, according to the US Sun.\n\nThe Chiefs tight end became an investor in the Alpine F1 team in October of 2023. He is joined by a few celebrities in the ownership group, including his Kansas City teammate Patrick Mahomes, PGA golfer Rory McIlroy, boxer Anthony Joshua and actor Ryan Reynolds.\n\nThe NFL offseason is in full swing, so Kelce has plenty of time on his hands to watch motor racing.\n\nFor Swift, she has a break in her Eras Tour schedule. Her last concert was back in March, but her nearly two-month break wraps up next week. She picks up again May 9 over in Europe, with the next leg of her concerts set to be held in France.\n\nThere is no evidence that Swift has attended an F1 race before.\n\nWhile Swift attended a select few sporting events in the past, her intake of sports has greatly increased since she started dating Kelce. She was a frequent viewer at Chiefs games throughout the 2023 season, culminating in her appearance at Super Bowl 58, where Kansas City defeated San Francisco.\n\nThe Miami Grand Prix is another opportunity for Kelce to get Swift into more sports, according to the US Sun.\n\n\"Travis sees that Taylor is falling in love with sports, and he is excited to take her there, as she also wants to know more and more about his passions,\" a source told the outlet.\n\nKelce may have recently become an investor into an F1 team, however, there is no evidence to suggest he has actually attended a race before.\n\nLast year, Mahomes was at the 2023 Miami Grand Prix with his wife, Brittany, however, it was just the duo attending the event.\n\nThis year, it appears as thought Mahomes will be joined by his partner-in-crime on the field, along with his girlfriend.\n\n\"Before going to Europe, they see this as the last opportunity before the Eras Euro part madness starts, and they are looking forward to seeing the race, and see how the backstage, the paddock, and the whole F1 experience is,\" a source said to the US Sun.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Online chatter suggests she could be in Europe already, where she begins the next leg of her Eras Tour May 9.\n\nPhotos and video clips posted to Brittany's Instagram Stories showed the couple partying with friends ahead of Sunday's race, including Brooke Cheatham, who tagged one post: \"Miami baby.\" Brooke is married to Patrick's childhood friend Ryan Cheatham.\n\nBrittany's longtime friend Paige Buechele was in the group too. She is married to Shane Buechele, Mahomes' former backup in Kansas City and now with the Buffalo Bills.\n\nIn October, Mahomes, Kelce and a group of other professional athletes including PGA golfer Rory McIlroy became part owners of the Formula One Alpine Racing team.\n\nSpeculation that Kelce and Swift might also attend the Grand Prix put Swift's fans on high alert for her whereabouts this weekend.\n\nOne of Kelce's buddies, former NBA player Chandler Parsons, spilled the beans in an interview at Churchill Downs on Friday that the Super Bowl champ would attend the 150th Running of the Roses on Saturday.\n\nPhotos posted online show Kelce, but no Swift, at a pre-Derby concert Friday by The Chainsmokers, the same band he and Swift partied with in Las Vegas after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl in February.\n\nThree other Chiefs are in Louisville, too.\n\nFriday night tight end Isiah Pacheco and offensive linemen Creed Humphrey and Mike Caliendo -- all looking fine in dark suits, it must be noted -- walked the red carpet at the annual Trifecta Gala in Louisville.\n\nPacheco later went live on Instagram during a ride through town in a swanky darkened vehicle and also shared his

Fans were thrilled by Kelce's outfit choice for the event, which included a white pinstripe suit and a navy fedora that had a small blue feather stuck in its brim.\n\nThe NFL player arrived at the track in time to watch several horse races before the Run for the Roses Saturday evening. In a video that the Kentucky Derby's official Instagram account shared with fans, Kelce stood in the stands watching one race unfold, growing more and more excited as the horses neared the finish line.\n\nKelce started jumping up and down in excitement and turned around in a half-circle, seemingly pleased with the race's final result. He had a huge smile on his face as he celebrated the win.\n\nThe Derby's Instagram account added a text overlay to the video that read, \"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits.\" The video's caption tagged Kelce's account as it noted he was \"off to a hot start at the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nFans who reposted the video on social media shared their own reactions to the football star's excitement. One person explained on X, formerly Twitter, that Kelce was \"jumping up and down cause his first bet hit\" and added, \"that's a golden retriever lol.\"\n\n\"Excitement like a little kid. He and Taylor really are similar,\" another fan tweeted, referring to Kelce's pop star girlfriend, Taylor Swift.\n\nThough some fans were hopeful that the \"Cruel Summer\" singer would join Kelce at the Derby, he appeared to be there with friends. The Kentucky Derby, which is the first of three jewels in horse racing's Triple Crown, is taking place this year just days before Swift's international Eras Tour is due to resume in Europe. Her next concert date is May 9 in Paris.\n\nNext: Anna Nicole Smith's Teen Daughter Dannielynn Makes a Bold Fashion Statement at Kentucky Derby Gala\n\nCopyright 2024 The Arena Group, Inc.

In a clip shared by ESPN on TikTok, he could be seen arriving at the venue with security.\n\nKelce's teammate Patrick Mahomes also attended the event with wife Brittany Mahomes, who looked stylish in a pink-and-white gingham minidress with front pockets.\n\nWith the Chiefs revving up their training camp schedule, Kelce is remaining focused on the upcoming NFL season. However, Kelce's attendance at the Grand Prix is likely related to his recent investment in the Formula 1 team, Alpine Racing.\n\nThe NFL star and Patrick, 28, became the lead investors in an ownership group that secured a $218 million investment into Alpine Racing, Otro Capital announced in October.\n\nThe Super Bowl champions joined four-time golf champion Rory McIlroy and Olympic boxing gold medalist Anthony Joshua in the investment, alongside Kelce's management company, A&A Management. Joining them is Andre Eanes of A&A Management, Joey Feste of KM Capital and Rhodes McKee of MavenHill Capital/ReynardMcKee.\n\nAlpine Racing shared a clip on Instagram of Kelce at the F1 Grand Prix proudly repping the team's logo on his baseball cap as he munched on some snacks.

Kelce's longtime agent Mike Simon negotiated the deal, in which the financial details were not immediately disclosed.\n\nRelated: Travis Kelce Says He Had 'a Blast' Hosting Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? and Teases 'Exciting Contestants'\n\nPatrick shared his excitement about Kelce's extension and that he would be continuing to work alongside his frequent target in a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\"I told yall I'll never let him leave!!

With Travis and Taylor apart for such a big event, it really makes you wonder what's going on behind the scenes that we can't see. Let's take a look.\n\nThere are quite a few reasons that can be speculated on as to why the pop star didn't show up to the Kentucky Derby with her boyfriend. They could be fighting, have scheduling conflicts, or maybe she just wasn't in the mood.\n\n\"Was Taylor with him? I want to see her hat she wore..

With Taylor Swift's Eras Tour taking her all over the world and into international territory, when she needs to travel, she needs to travel. There's not much more to it than that.\n\nStarting on May 9th, Taylor Swift is set to appear in France for her next leg of The Eras Tour and she'll be spending four days performing in Paris with Paramore. That's quite the flight to make, and it's entirely understandable for her to want to take some time to prepare before she gets ready to travel.

But when Kelce appeared on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" in September 2023, he dismissed the sudden flurry of reporting on his love life as nothing more than regurgitated gossip. \"It's like an old game in school called telephone, where everyone's just whispering in each other's ear, just hearing some random stuff,\" he said.

He accessorized the eclectic ensemble with a pair of pale pink sneakers and small earrings.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kelce has worn Kidsuper clothing. In September 2023, he stepped out with girlfriend Taylor Swift in a blue and white jacket and trousers set by the same brand. The two-piece outfit was later renamed the 1989 Bedroom Painting set after the 1989 album that Swift, 34, released in 2014.\n\nKelce posed for the cameras with the founder of the New York City-based Italian restaurant Carbone, Mario Carbone, as well as professional BMX athlete Nigel Sylvester. Hours earlier, Kelce attended the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix at Hardrock Stadium in a green Givenchy button down shirt ($890) and matching shorts ($890). He accessorized the colorful outfit with a black Alpine Racing baseball hat and dark sunglasses.\n\nHis appearance at Formula 1 comes one day after he attended the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, May 4. There, the NFL star put on a dapper display in an ivory pinstripe double-breasted suit which he paired with a fedora hat, blue button down shirt and dark blue tie.\n\nNotably, Swift was nowhere to be seen during any of Kelce's latest outings. Much to the disappointment of fans, the couple is also rumored to not be attending the Met Gala.\n\n\"Taylor and Travis are not going to the Met Gala. They passed,\" a source told Us Weekly in April. \"They might go as it gets closer, but for now, they are not going.\"\n\nIn March, another source exclusively told Us Weekly that Kelce and Swift, 34, are taking \"a break from the buzz of their careers\" to spend \"quality time together and with friends and family.\"\n\nThe source continued, \"They're focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together.

Someone walking alongside him blocked the person from sight, but he added, \"I wish I had one to give him back,\" before the video ended.\n\nAs the sports network's caption read, \"Travis Kelce always makes time for friendship bracelets.\"\n\nThe tight end almost became synonymous with them after he wove his phone number into a beaded bracelet to slip to the Eras Tour artist while she was performing in Kansas City, going viral after he detailed his failure to get it to her.\n\nBut he still managed to connect with her, and ever since the two went public with their relationship, he's made fans swoon by integrating himself into her fandom, rocking arms full of bracelets at each Eras show he attends. He was even spotted wearing one as he supported his brother, Jason Kelce, as the Eagles legend announced his retirement from the NFL and commissioned a friendship-bracelet-inspired diamond tennis bracelet for the \"You're On Your Own Kid\" songstress, who singlehandedly renewed the friendship bracelet economy with the Midnights track.\n\nNext: Fans Gush Over Cartoon Travis Kelce Making Friendship Bracelets to Woo Taylor Swift\n\nCopyright 2024 The Arena Group, Inc.

Upon the NFL star's arrival on Sunday, May 5, he was greeted with Taylor's newest hit \"Florida!!!\"\n\n\"Welcome to Florida, Travis,\" the official BWT Alping F1 Team wrote via X on May 5, alongside a video of Travis, 34.\n\nIn the clip, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end rocked matching emerald shorts and a button-up shirt set while grabbing a bite to eat. The account paired the video to his Grammy-winning girlfriend's song \"Florida,\" which is a standout hit from her newest studio album, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nTravis had a jam-packed weekend away from Taylor, 34, as he was spotted at the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, May 4. The event's official Instagram page shared clips as Travis won his first bet of the day.\n\nThe professional athlete has continued to support Taylor's most recent album, which broke the record for the most single-day Spotify album streams, coming in at a hot 300M streams in a single day.\n\n\"Who wouldn't be flattered?\" a source exclusively told Life & Style in May in reference of the songs \"The Alchemy\" and \"So High School,\" which are seemingly about Travis. \"He loves her, and he's made it clear he feels incredibly lucky to be the guy who finally gets to worship her like she deserves.\"\n\nTravis and Taylor, who started dating after he attended her Eras tour show in Kansas City in July 2023, had date night at Patrick Mahomes' 15 and the Mahomies charity gala in April. Videos circulated the internet of the pair as they enjoyed the event in Las Vegas. Fans went wild over a PDA video as Travis held Taylor by her low waist while in conversation with other attendees.\n\nIt's been clear that Travis was all in with Taylor ever since they sparked a romance. As the two near their one-year anniversary, the Chasing Kelce alum wants to take the next step.\n\n\"Travis is eager to speed up their relationship timeline,\" a source exclusively dished to Life & Style on April 18. \"He wants to marry Taylor right away and start a family as soon as she's ready. Travis has been so broody that he's told Taylor he's open to having kids before a wedding! His fatherly instincts kick in whenever he spends time with his three young niece.

The 34-year-old NFL star left Kansas City for the prestigious Kentucky Derby and brought his very unique sense of style with him.\n\nHeld on Saturday, May 4 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, KY, Travis turned heads in a white pinstripe double-breasted suit paired with a blue shirt, pocket square and navy tie. To complete the look, he added a navy fedora hat with feather details.\n\nTravis arrived in Louisville the day before and attended the Chainsmokers show at the city's Ice House.\n\nHeld as part of the Sports Illustrated Revel at the Races concert, the three-time Super Bowl champion enjoyed the show then spent time backstage with Chainsmokers member Alex Pall, with Alex sharing a series of photos on his media pages social.\n\nTravis' girlfriend Taylor Swift wasn't in attendance, and it's believed she may already be in Europe, as the fourth leg of his record-breaking Eras Tour returns to the stage on the 9th May in Paris, France.\n\nThe trip to Kentucky comes after a busy offseason for Travis, following the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl victory in February 2024. He traveled to Asia and Australia to attend several shows on Taylor's Eras tour, attended Coachella with Taylor, and also spent time in Los Angeles filming her new TV show, Are you smarter than a celebrity?\n\nAmazon Prime has ordered the 20-episode series.\n\n\"I grew up loving game shows and am thrilled to follow in the footsteps of so many television icons by hosting my very first with Are you Smarter than a Celebrity?,\" Travis said in a statement.\n\n\"The original show is a big hit, so bringing a new format to the screen with everyone's favorite celebrities will definitely be entertaining. I'm just happy to be on the hosting side of the equation here and I I can't wait to see how these famous faces continue.\"\n\nGirlfriend Taylor also had a busy 2024, releasing her 11th studio album The Tortured Poets Department on April 19 during her Eras Tour hiatus. The anticipated 16-track album turned out to be a 31-track anthology after she released 15 additional tracks two hours after its original release.\n\nAlthough the album focuses heavily on what she calls a \"manic\" period - as she dealt with the heartbreak of ending her six-year romance with Joe Alwyn and experienced a whirlwind romance but from short-lived with Matty Healy - there are two songs that fans think are about Travis, who she met in August 2023.\n\nIn \"The Alchemy,\" the star sings, \"So when I land/Call the amateurs and the outcasts on the team,\" referencing the NFL's scoring method.\n\nAnother ode to Travis sees the singer feeling \"so high school\" around him, alluding to the public's perception of the couple as high school prom king and queen.", "source":

He was seen in photos taken by TMZ with the fellas from the Chainsmokers and in a photo with the Houston Rockets' player Chandler Parsons. Late night host Jimmy Fallon shared a clip of them chatting on Instagram as well.\n\nHe was later seen in more casual wear at the Sports Illustrated Revel at the Races party at Ice House.\n\nIt's not too surprising that Taylor wasn't at the Derby. The couple also turned down an invite for the Met Gala on Monday, because Taylor's Eras Tour resumes in Paris on May 9 and she was planning to travel. She is most likely already on her way to Europe in preparation for her first concert or getting ready at home.\n\nThe official Kentucky Derby Instagram account shared a clip showing Travis celebrating after winning a bet on a race, which they captioned, \"When you show up to the Kentucky Derby and your first bet hits.\"\n\nWhen asked if he'd be attending any European tour dates, Travis told Entertainment Tonight, \"You know I gotta go support.\"\n\nHe went on, \"We're both very career driven, we both love what we do, and so any chance that I can show my support to her and knowing that she's shown me all the support in the world throughout the season, it's just been an amazing experience getting to know Tay...She's so amazing at what she does, and to find that creativity, to see where she likes to pull things from and really just how she listens to music, is really very eye opening for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "cosmopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cosmopolitan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chainsmokers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Chainsmokers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Fallon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-at-neon-carnival-held-during-news-photo-1714917346.jpg?crop=0.923xw:0.641xh;0.0144xw,0.0713xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 772, "textEnd": 777}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Surprising her followers time and time again with clues, cryptic messages and Easter eggs, fans of Swift have dozens and dozens of burning questions surrounding this year's event: Will she actually show up? If so, what will she wear?\n\nWith co-chairs Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Zendaya certain to be in attendance at the exquisite evening of fashion -- taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight (May 6) -- Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, received an invitation to the star-studded night earlier this year. While we are confident that both parties would rock this year's theme, \"The Garden of Time\" -- which is sure to be jam-packed with botanical outfits -- it looks like neither Swift nor Kelce will not be stepping out in their finest fits after all.\n\nYou may be asking yourself why, but fortunately, we got you covered. Keep scrolling to find out everything we know so far...\n\nWhile it is unclear whether or not Swift will actually be in attendance until the limousines start to arrive in the Big Apple, PEOPLE reported on April 29 that she is likely skipping out on the special night to focus on the next leg of her critically-acclaimed Eras Tour, which will resume in Paris, France on Thursday (May 9). TMZ reiterated this soul-crushing announcement as well, leaving fans of Swift confident that she will not be stepping out in style at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight after all.\n\nAs far as Kelce goes, it is unclear whether or not he will be in attendance, but without his greatest accessory at his side -- the \"Cruel Summer\" singer herself -- it is likely that he will be skipping out on the star-studded evening as well, despite receiving an invitation.\n\nWhile it has been reported by many media outlets that the oh-so attractive couple will be missing the 2024 Met Gala, we would not be surprised if Swift and Kelce shocked the world by showing up. Making a surprise appearance at Coachella last month to support friends Ice Spice and Jack Antonoff -- marking the \"Bad Blood\" singer's first time attending the festival since 2016 -- anything is possible. After all, she has not attended the Met Gala since 2016 either!\n\nWill 2024 be the year that history repeats itself for Swift? Only time will tell, but it's safe to say that we will be seated on our couch, watching through our cell phone screens to see whether or not she actually arrives alongside Kelce.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melanie_rooten@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Melanie Rooten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limousine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limousine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Spice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice Spice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coachella (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_Summer_(Bananarama_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruel Summer (Bananarama song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DF9BB9D4-F0D3-451F-8AF3-10221586C8C4.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 598, "textEnd": 603}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1266, "textEnd": 1274}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1440, "textEnd": 1445}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

The 34-year-old NFL star left Kansas City for the prestigious Kentucky Derby, - and brought with him his very unique sense of style.\n\nHeld on Saturday, May 4 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, KY, Travis made heads turn in a white pinstripe double-breasted suit paired with a blue shirt, pocket square and navy blue tie. To bring the look together, he added a navy fedora hat with feather detailing.\n\nTravis arrived in Louisville the day before, and attended The Chainsmokers' show at the Ice House in the city.\n\nHeld as part of the Sports Illustrated Revel at the Races concert, the three-time Super Bowl champ enjoyed the show and then spent time backstage with Chainsmokers member Alex Pall, with Alex sharing a series of pictures on his social media pages.\n\nTravis' girlfriend Taylor Swift was not in attendance, and it is thought she may already be in Europe, as the fourth leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour returns to the stage on May 9 in Paris, France.\n\nThe trip to Kentucky comes after a busy off-season for Travis, following the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win in February 2024. He traveled to Asia and Australia to take in several of Taylor's Eras Tour shows, attended Coachella with Taylor, and also spent time in Los Angeles filming his new TV show, Are You Smarter Than A Celebrity?\n\nAmazon Prime ordered the 20-episode series.\n\n\"I grew up loving game shows, and I'm excited to be following in the footsteps of so many TV icons by hosting my very first one with Are you Smarter than a Celebrity?,\" Travis said in a statement.\n\n\"The original show is a great success, so to be bringing a new format with everyone's favorite celebrities to the screen, will definitely be entertaining. I'm just happy to be on the hosting side of the equation here and excited to see how these famous faces keep up.\"\n\nGirlfriend Taylor also had a busy 2024, releasing her 11th studio album The Tortured Poets Department, on April 19, during her Eras Tour break. The expected 16-track album turned out to be a 31-track anthology after she dropped a further 15 tracks two hours after its original release.\n\nAlthough the album focuses heavily on what she calls a \"manic\" period -- as she dealt with the heartbreak of ending her six-year romance with Joe Alwyn, and enjoyed a whirlwind but short-lived romance with Matty Healy -- there are two songs that fans believe to be about Travis, whom she met in August 2023.\n\nIn 'The Alchemy' the star croons: \"So when I touch down/Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team,\" referencing the NFL method of scoring.\n\nAnother ode to Travis sees the singer feeling \"so high school\" with him, alluding to the couple's public perception as the high school prom king and queen.", "source": {"uri":

Florida!!! While attending the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Miami Sunday (May 5), the 34-year-old tight end met and chatted with fans, one of whom gifted him with a Taylor Swift-inspired friendship bracelet at the International Autodrome.\n\nIn a clip posted to ESPN's NFL Instagram page, the Kansas City Chiefs star graciously takes the beaded accessory and says, \"You're too kind, thank you so much.\"\n\nHe added, \"I wish I had one to give you back!\"\n\nFriendship bangles have a special place in the timeline of Kelce and Swift's romance, with the New Heights host first catching the pop star's eye by revealing on his podcast that he'd tried unsuccessfully to slip her his phone number on a bracelet at one of her Kansas City Eras Tour shows last summer. The couple started dating shortly after, and the rest was history.\n\nKelce was also personally welcomed to the Sunshine State by the BWT Alpine F1 racing team, which tweeted a video of the athlete hanging out and enjoying snacks behind the scenes at the track. Fittingly, the post was soundtracked by his superstar girlfriend's The Tortured Poets Department duet with Florence + The Machine, \"Florida!!!\"\n\n\"I grew up loving game shows, and I'm excited to be following in the footsteps of so many TV icons by hosting my very first one,\" he wrote in a statement at the time. \"The original show is a great success, so to be bringing a new format with everyone's favorite celebrities to the screen will definitely be entertaining.\"\n\nSee clips from Travis' recent trip to Florida below.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_dailey@billboard.com", "name": "Hannah Dailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Gyllenhaal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Gyllenhaal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Carpenter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Carpenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-super-bowl-2024-leaving-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 194, "textEnd": 199}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

The last time the Midnights singer has been to the Oscars of the East Coast six times, most recently in 2016. But her touring commitments have called her attendance at 2024 into question. Here's what we know.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual fundraiser for the Costume Institute takes the world by storm with celebs wearing elegant outfits and gracing the steps that lead down Fifth Avenue. However, not everyone can attain an invite just like that Since 1995, the guest list and table seating chart have been curated by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, with only around 600 people making the list each year.\n\nThis year's theme is Garden of Time; inspired by the Met Museum's Sleeping Beauty: Reawakening Fashion exhibition. It will showcase 250 historically significant pieces which are fashion's 'sleeping beauties'; garments far too fragile ever to be worn again.\n\nSwift first graced the Met Gala red carpet in 2008 and appeared again in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014 and finally in 2016. Given that until December 2024, she's undertaking her mammoth Eras Tour with a 44-long setlist spanning her entire career and more than three hours, her fans are desperate to know whether she'll make an appearance once more.\n\nThere have been conflicting reports as to whether Taylor Swift is going to the Met Gala, but perhaps the most telling was a cryptic response from Anna Wintour. In an interview with TODAY, Jenna Bush Hager asked if Taylor would be walking the Met's famous steps. \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit,\" Anna coyly replied.\n\nAccording to a report in TMZ, Taylor and her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, both received invitations to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in support of its coveted costume institution, but neither of them are going. It's likely because it's the same week that her Eras Tour kicks back up in Paris. We're pretty sure Travis wouldn't go unless Taylor was, so that's that.\n\nDespite being romantically linked since September 2023 and spotted in PDA at the Super Bowl, Taylor and Travis have yet to walk a red carpet together. The last opportunity they had was at the 2024 Grammys and that, for him, was bad timing because Travis had to play in this thing called the Super Bowl.\n\nWhile appearing on The Pat McAfee Show on January 31, 2024, he said, \"I wish I could go support Taylor at the Grammys, and watch her win every single award that she's nominated for,\" adding, \"But I think I've got practice on Sunday. ... Unfortunately, I've gotta get ready for this big old Super Bowl that we've got in a week.\"\n\nHe has seemingly made an appearance elsewhere in her life, most notably in lyrics from her new album The Tortured Poets Department. In \"So High School\", Taylor sings \"I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice / Do that impression you did of your dad again\".\n\nShortly after the album dropped, Travis' New Heights podcast that he hosts with his brother Jason where the two siblings are doing impressions of their dad, Ed Kelce, with the caption, \"Those Papa Kelce impressions are just too good.\" That was enough for Swifties who took that as confirmation the song is about Travis.\n\nThere are more obvious references to their romance though. In \"The Alchemy\", Taylor sings \"Shirts off, and your friends lift you up, over their heads / Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said / 'There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league' / Where's the trophy? He just comes, running over to me,\" in a pretty clear nod to the Kansas City Chiefs win at the 2023 Super Bowl.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department is Swift's 11th studio album, which she announced during her speech for the Best Pop Vocal Album award at the 66th annual Grammy Awards. \"This is my 13th Grammy, which is my lucky number. I don't know if I've ever told you that. I want to say thank you to the members of the Recording Academy for voting this way, but I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans,\" Swift said.", "source": {"uri": "stylecaster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StyleCaster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_hanson@stylecaster.com", "name": "Sophie Hanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fifth Avenue"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Bush_Hager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Bush Hager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVII", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/66th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "66th Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Recording_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Recording Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Vocal_Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-6.png?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

One of the most star-studded parties of the weekend was Sports Illustrated's Revel At The Races party.\n\nYes, the publication that looked to be on the ropes just a couple of months ago, just threw a giant shindig at the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe bash was held at The Ice House in downtown Louisville (by the way, I think every city in America has a club, bar, or restaurant called \"The Ice House\") and this thing was star-studded.\n\nFirst of all, the Chainsmokers were there to spin some tunes or pretend to press some buttons or whatever it is they do. But they were the entertainment. The big stars were the guests.\n\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was there. I think there's some kind of federal regulation that if you throw a high-profile party he has to be on the guest list.\n\nTo the disappointment of some but the relief of the rest of us, Kelce was flying solo for this party. Must be tough for him. Anytime he and the gal pal go anywhere, he can only be the second most famous person on the guest list tops.\n\nWhat a gut punch for the ol' ego.\n\nMr. Pfizer had some competition on Friday night. He may not have been the most famous NFLer on hand because New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers was in attendance too.\n\nI think we all want to know what's in that bottle.\n\nVodka? Gin? Uncle Aaron's special party juice? Could be anything!\n\nWhile Rodgers and Kelce were the NFL headliners, there were some other current and former players on hand. Devante Adams, AJ Hawke, Jimmy Graham, and David Bakhitiari were all there, as was ex-NBA player Chandler Parsons.\n\nI know what you're thinking, \"Sounds like a bit of a sausage party.\"\n\nFear not: influencer Alix Earle and SI Swimsuit model Ellie Thumann headlined the *Jerry Lewis voice* Laaaaaaadieeeeeeees' roster.\n\nWhat a night... probably. Parties like this sound like my own personal hell, but everyone who was there seems to have had a nice time.\n\nFortunately for them, they can hit Churchill Downs and continue the part with some mint juleps while they watch the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_reigle@outkick.com", "name": "Matt Reigle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ice_House_(comedy_club)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ice House (comedy club)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Louisville", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Louisville"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chainsmokers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Chainsmokers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_julep", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mint julep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pfizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/rodgers-kelce-si-party.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Her previous work appears in The New York Post and Popstar! Magazine.\n\nTravis Kelce was seen checking out some getaway cars at the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Florida.\n\nOn Sunday, May 5, the 34-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end took in the action at the popular race weekend in Miami, wearing a vibrant green shirt-and-shorts set, sunglasses, a black baseball cap and black sneakers. In a clip shared by ESPN on TikTok, he could be seen arriving at the venue with security.\n\nKelce's teammate Patrick Mahomes also attended the event with wife Brittany Mahomes, who looked stylish in a pink-and-white gingham minidress with front pockets.\n\nWith the Chiefs revving up their training camp schedule, Kelce is remaining focused on the upcoming NFL season. However, Kelce's attendance at the Grand Prix is likely related to his recent investment in the Formula 1 team, Alpine Racing.\n\nThe NFL star and Patrick, 28, became the lead investors in an ownership group that secured a $218 million investment into Alpine Racing, Otro Capital announced in October.\n\nThe Super Bowl champions joined four-time golf champion Rory McIlroy and Olympic boxing gold medalist Anthony Joshua in the investment, alongside Kelce's management company, A&A Management. Joining them is Andre Eanes of A&A Management, Joey Feste of KM Capital and Rhodes McKee of MavenHill Capital/ReynardMcKee.\n\nAlpine Racing shared a clip on Instagram of Kelce at the F1 Grand Prix proudly repping the team's logo on his baseball cap as he munched on some snacks. The team captioned the clip -- which was fittingly set to Kelce's girlfriend Taylor Swift's song \"Florida!!!\" -- \"Welcome to Florida, @killatrav \ud83e\udd19.\"\n\nIn a statement, Kelce said the Alpine Racing partnership with his close friend Patrick and \"world-class\" private equity firm Otro Capital is a \"dream come true\" for him.\n\n\"We are embracing this opportunity to be a part of something extraordinary, and we look forward to contributing our passion and commitment to this incredible team,\" Kelce said.\n\nPatrick said he's \"thrilled\" to \"join forces\" with Kelce and Otro Capital for the F1 investment and \"to support the world-class Alpine Racing Team,\" in a statement at the time.\n\nPatrick added, \"As athletes, we understand the importance of teamwork, dedication, and the pursuit of excellence. We see these same qualities in Alpine Racing and are excited to be a part of their journey to further success.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nKelce's weekend at the Miami Grand Prix comes just after NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported that Kelce agreed to terms on a new two-year contract extension with the Chiefs on April 29.\n\nThe extension is worth more than $17 million a year, which will make him the highest-paid tight end in the league. Kelce's longtime agent Mike Simon negotiated the deal, in which the financial details were not immediately disclosed.\n\nPatrick shared his excitement about Kelce's extension and that he would be continuing to work alongside his frequent target in a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\"I told yall I'll never let him leave!! Congrats my guy!,\" the quarterback wrote on X.\n\nLast season, Kelce and Patrik broke the long-held record set by Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski for most postseason touchdowns in NFL history last season. Brady, 46, congratulated the duo after, writing, \"BEASTS. When you one up gronk you're doing something right,\" Brady wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter).", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [],

They often find themselves in situations where his wild side can be a bit too much. This was the case during their recent outing in Las Vegas, where Travis's antics left Taylor feeling more than a little embarrassed.\n\nTaylor and Travis were dressed to the nines and all set to enjoy a swanky night out together during their pals Brittany and Patrick Mahome's charity event. It was all for a good cause, and everyone in attendance was having a great time. That is until Travis Kelce jumped on the mic to help raise bids on a pair of Taylor's Eras Tour tickets.\n\nIt seems that Travis took things a little too far for Taylor Swift's liking. Especially when he yelled \"Viva Las Vegas\" into the microphone, just like he did after his big Super Bowl win. The crowd laughed off Travis's obnoxious behavior; however, according to Page Six, Taylor did not find her NFL boyfriend's behavior quite as amusing.\n\nAccording to a lip reader on Instagram, Taylor Swift was seemingly annoyed. She claims the Cruel Summer singer was allegedly seen mouthing the words to friend Brittany Mahomes, \"That again,\" she said while shaking her head. \"I can't do it,\" she added.\n\nDespite Taylor Swift's cringeworthy moment, everyone had fun. However, some fans laughed. They think Taylor may have her work cut out for her, especially if she plans to get Travis's husband ready.\n\nHowever, once Taylor and Travis marry, it may take her some time to calm his wild side down. Of course, there are times when Taylor Swift swoons over Travis Kelce's romantic gestures and fun-loving spirit.\n\nThe two of them will have to find their marital balance. This is so Taylor doesn't get too embarrassed by him when they are at all of the grown-up functions. It should be interesting to see how these two grow as a couple, especially after marriage.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodnewsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood News Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruby_roberts@hollywoodnewsdaily.com", "name": "Ruby Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Las_Vegas_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viva Las Vegas (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_Summer_(Bananarama_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruel Summer (Bananarama song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Darts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Darts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538302", "eventUri": "eng-9538302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

The Elizabethan era is likely to be tapped, mimicking the concept of preservation, as well as organic elements, like floral embellishments.\n\nDespite skipping the Met Gala, the couple was still recently able to attend Coachella and were spotted during the first weekend.\n\nThey watched Jack Antonoff's band, Bleachers, perform at the festival in Indio, California, on Saturday, with many fans taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, to share clips of them.\n\nSwift and Kelce were seen dancing side stage as the band performed during the first weekend of the annual music festival. TikToker Kale Tompkins, who was in the crowd during the concert, recorded a video of the two's interaction.\n\nThis was the first time Swift had attended the celeb-loved music festival since 2016, when she famously rocked up to the desert with her bleach blonde hairstyle -- known as \"Bleachella.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kelce attended the event in 2022 and 2023 alongside some of his best friends.\n\nFor her outfit, Swift was seen wearing a piece of branded merchandise from Travis and his older brother, Jason's, podcast, New Heights, specifically a dark green baseball cap with the podcast's name on it written in white font. Kelce was also seen in a baseball hat that was white with the phrase \"Happy Gilmore\" written across the front.\n\nIn addition to the matching baseball caps, the Grammy winner was wearing black jean shorts with an oversized leather jacket and a black tank top. Kelce was sporting various patterns with unbuttoned flannel and a white undershirt, vertical-striped blue and white pants, white Converse sneakers, and a tie-dyed bandana around his neck.\n\nDuring the most recent episode of New Heights Travis raved about the experience to his brother Jason.\n\n\"I love live music, man. I absolutely love live music. I don't get enough of it in my life,\" he confessed. \"I really enjoy any event, I just like going to events, going places where people are, seeing talents, all these talented people in the world. I just like to experience that type of s***. I love experiencing new cultures.\n\n\"That's the one thing that I really enjoy about Coachella is that it's not just one genre of music. It's everything,\" the football star continued.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brittany_miller@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Brittany Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coachella (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleachers_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleachers (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

While the Cleveland, Ohio, native did his slightly cringeworthy \"Viva Las Vegas\" chant upon hitting the stage to help auction off items, Travis proved to be in control and not partying hard.\n\nHe took the opportunity to praise Taylor, 34, as his \"significant other\" before offering up four tickets for her Eras tour's final U.S. stops in the fall. Travis managed to get a final bid of $80,000, which went to Pat's charity.\n\nThe couple \"walked in holding hands and were affectionate all night,\" an eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight about their behavior at the event. The source added that there was \"lots of kissing and just overall happiness between\" the duo. Travis was later photographed with his hand lovingly holding Taylor's behind at the gala.\n\nFans and some Swifties become slightly worried about Travis' drinking after he got so wasted at the Chief's Super Bowl 2024 victory parade that he was unable to sing Garth Brooks' \"Friends in Low Places\" on stage. He slurred his words and caused Pat to have to step in and lead the crowd in the chorus.\n\nHowever, it proved to be the athlete in an elevated celebratory state, as he also partied hard at Patrick's team party for the Chiefs in Las Vegas on February 24.\n\nTravis and Taylor attended the 2023 Coachella Music Festival on April 13, where the \"Cruel Summer\" singer let loose. The pair danced and kissed while in the audience watching her pal Ice Spice's performance before moving on to the Neon Carnival dance tent.\n\nSquid Game alum Jackie Gonzalez, who is deaf and read lips, claimed at one point the \"Karma\" singer said to her boyfriend, \"That was the best thing that's happened tonight. Sorry, I'm drunk.\"\n\nParty time is done for the time being, as Taylor begins the European leg of her Eras tour on May 9, while Travis is preparing to host the game show, Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?, before getting back to work with the Chiefs at training camp in the summer.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

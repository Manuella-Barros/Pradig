wolf at the door, it may well be Chinese director-producer-star turned uber wolfpack leader, Wu Jing, whose recent effort, \"Wolf Warrior II\", has gobbled up the competition to become a genuine cultural phenomenon, not only in China, but also for Hollywood.\n\nAfter shocked by the movie's performance in box office, raking in 650 million U.S. dollars since July 28 to this weekend in China alone, some critics, like Film Journal International, contend that it's because \"'Wolf Warrior II' is like a propaganda movie, with Leng even unfurling a Chinese flag at one point to assure safe passage through a war zone.\"\n\nBut more critics shrugged off the prejudice, just like the Rotten Tomatoes.com only gave the movie a 50 percent on their tomatometer while it scored 88 percent on their audience approval score.\n\n\"Like Sylvester Stallone before him, and John Wayne before Stallone, star Wu Jing has successfully exploited the crowd-pleasing potential of enhancing militaristic action-adventure heroics with a heavy dose of flag-waving patriotism,\" the Variety argued in the latest report about the movie published Friday.\n\n\"The big difference here, of course, is that the flag waved by Wu and others in this shoot-'em-up extravaganza is that of the People's Republic of China, and Wu's heroic Leng Feng is not a Green Beret, but rather a once and future member of his country's elite Wolf Warriors special ops unit,\" the report said.\n\nItalian-American co-star, Frank Grillo, who compellingly plays the blood-thirsty mercenary antagonist, \"Big Daddy\", rebutted it as well, \"It's Chinese nationalistic, not propaganda. It's no more propaganda than 'Rambo'.\"\n\nGrillo, best known for his portrayal of famed Marvel comic book character, \"Crossbones\" in Disney's blockbuster \"Captain America\" franchise, sang Wu Jing's praises in an exclusive interview with Xinhua Thursday, \"He's a special man who's got his finger on the pulse of what politically and emotionally charges his country. He understands China's Zeitgeist.\"\n\nWu also dismisses this criticism, while readily admitting his film is \"a combination of a commercial action movie and a Chinese military propaganda movie.\" During a recent press conference, he angrily retorted, \"Why is that a problem? America makes movies that promote the American spirit. Why can't I do that for China?\"\n\nAnd many of his countrymen agree. Though Wu may still be learning the narrative nuances that would enable his films to appeal to international audiences as well, Chinese audiences voted with their wallets, sending \"Wolf Warrior II\" snarling to a record-breaking first place as the highest grossing movie in China's history.\n\n\"Wu Jing's 'sturm und drang' is making Hollywood sit up and take notice,\" Grillo told Xinhua.\n\n\"I've got about 15 calls from Hollywood studio people, casting people and producers, asking, 'Can Wu Jing speak English?'\" revealed Grillo. \"Wu Jing can do anything. He's breathing very thin air right now and is in a room with very few other people.\"\n\nCelina Jade, Chinese-American singer-turned-actress who plays the beautiful doctor in the movie, echoed Grillo's words.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Xinhua last week, she recounted, \"Wu Jing called me the very last minute and said, 'I'm doing a movie and I need a lead actress. Can you fly tonight?' I really wanted to help because my acting career wouldn't exist if it weren't for this guy pushing me forward ... I knew this was my opportunity to help him back.\"\n\n\"On top of that, my Mom is Chinese and she was worried I was losing my heritage and roots. She wanted me to do it,\" Jane said.\n\nShe emphasized that Hollywood can noticed that this movie is far more technically sophisticated than a typical B-movie and easily outstrips Wu Jing's franchise-founding predecessor, \"Wolf Warrior\", as Wu clearly styled himself after Sylvester Stallone's \"Rambo\" with more than a pinch of Jackie Chan thrown in for good measure.\n\n\"It is an amazing movie first,\" both Grillo and Jade used the same words before involved in the controversy.\n\nThe film uses high-production value cinematography, complete with sweeping aerial and crane shots, massive underwater and high action, military set pieces featuring deadly drones, seagoing vessels and marauding tanks.\n\nThere's also no shortage of gut-pummeling, hand-to-hand combat scenes and elaborate stunt sequences designed by Marvel's top stunt master, Sam Hargrave (\"Captain America\", \"Hunger Games\"), along with China's fight choreographer Wai Leung Wong (\"Operation Mekong\").\n\nHargrave said at a recent press conference, \"It' s a big movie and a big challenge. With 50 to 100 explosions, it's like the 'Fast and Furious' with a tank!\"\n\nClearly, Wu's type of explosive, flag-waving, nationalistic action-adventure strikes a deep chord with Chinese audiences. What remains to be seen is whether, like Jackie Chan before him, Wu Jing can make the leap from homegrown superstar to a global box office draw.\n\nGrillo's prediction? \"The next iteration for Chinese and American cultures is: we go in and make movies that both cultures can connect to.\"", "time": "08:12:00"}

African country fighting local rebels and cutthroat arms dealers. And amid the bullet-carrying drones, tank chase scenes and one-on-one fisticuffs with super villains, the hero manages to romance a beautiful woman.\n\nSound like a Hollywood action film? Well, the plot and characters may suggest it, but \"Wolf Warrior 2\" is actually a Chinese-made movie with a Chinese lead actor, African refugees and a white Western villain. It broke the domestic box office record earlier this week.\n\nWu Jing was both director and star of the film, which has drawn somewhat tepid critical reviews despite its commercial success. Still, the movie has been hailed by fans as the most authentic superhero film ever portrayed in a Chinese film.\n\n\"Wu Jing has created a real Chinese hero,\" commented Du She Film, a popular film critic with 5 million followers on Weibo. \"The typical Chinese hero in previous patriotic movies was usually impossibly perfect. This one is different. He is arrested and expelled at the beginning of the movie. He drinks too much and loses control of himself. He is a real person, something most previous films of this genre failed to achieve.\"\n\n\"Wolf Warrior 2\" cost 200 million yuan (US$30 million) to make. It hit the screens on July 27 and within two weeks broke the domestic box-office record of 3.39 billion yuan previously set by Stephen Chow's 2016 fantasy-comedy \"The Mermaid.\"\n\nGross revenue has already surpassed 4 billion yuan, with analysts estimating it could end up earning between 5 billion and 6 billion yuan. \"Wolf Warrior 3\" is already in the works.\n\nThe movie, with English subtitles, has had limited release in cinemas in the United States, Singapore, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe runaway success of the film took many by surprise. \"We initially estimated it to gross about 1.2 billion yuan, and I revised that to 1.5 billion after seeing the competed film, but I never expected it to become such a phenomenon,\" Jiang Wusheng, one of the film's distributors, told the media.\n\nForeign action movies based on Marvel Comics characters have swept the Chinese market in the past few years, and many Chinese filmmakers have tried and failed to come up with a domestic superhero to match.\n\nThe first \"Wolf Warrior,\" which premiered two summers ago, grossed 560 million yuan. It was considered a dark horse after Wu spent years convincing investors to back the production.\n\nThe actor, 43, is not a superstar of the status of Jackie Chan or Jet Li or Donnie Yen, though he has appeared in several Hong Kong kung fu films. Some investors weren't convinced that a Chinese-made superhero film would resonate with audiences, since so many previous domestic action films were martial arts movies without guns or car chases or were nationalistic movies dismissed as patriotic propaganda.\n\nWu said in a recent interview that many people have a stereotyped image of patriotic films as something apart from commercial movies.\n\n\"Why do we have to separate them?\" he asked. \"'Wolf Warrior 2' has every element a commercial blockbuster requires.\"\n\nThe emergence of this summer mega-movie is reminiscent of the success of the 2012 comedy \"Lost in Thailand.\" It was the first Chinese movie to gross more than 1 billion yuan, surprising and charming audiences in a market that lacked domestic comedies.\n\nSimilarly, the market has also been devoid of domestic action blockbusters and Chinese heroes.\n\nWhile Hollywood films often glorify underdogs, Chinese patriotic films and TV have typically portrayed leading men as flawless heroes. They are often so unrealistic that they bore audiences. However, the line between good and bad in Chinese films and TV is beginning to blur.\n\nFor example, the hit TV series \"In the Name of the People\" drew its plot from China's anti-corruption campaign. Most investors shunned the project because they didn't think the subject matter would appeal to young audiences. Yet, surprisingly, the show became one of the most popular on TV in the first half of this year. Young viewers were captivated by the intriguing characters and the conniving shenanigans of some government officials.\n\nIn somewhat the same way, the \"Wolf Warrior\" series is redefining the image of the Chinese soldier.\n\nWu's character, Leng Feng, has been kicked out of the army. He goes to an unnamed African country where a military coup has broken out and tries to rescue a Chinese scientist trapped there. In the end, he saves both Chinese and African employees of a Chinese-invested factory from local renegades and Western mercenaries.\n\nThe film's patriotic theme, its passionate portrait of a Chinese soldier and Leng's incredible feats of bravado have all become the subjects of fierce public debate, making it one of the most talked-about films in Chinese movie-making.\n\nOn douban.com, China's version of IMDB, the film is rated 7.5 out of 10. On the Western Rotten Tomatoes site, critics gave it 2.5 out of 10, though the audience rating was 90 percent favorable.\n\nThe film's detractors say the plot is illogical and the theme is too nationalistic.\n\n\"The film was entertaining for the most part, but I found it awkward when the protagonist waves the Chinese flag through the war zone and both parties just stop firing and let the Chinese through,\" says 28-year-old Wang Haili, an action film fan. \"I read later that the scene was inspired by real events, but, still, it felt weird to see that on the screen.\"\n\nThose who love the film cite the same scene as an adrenalin moment.\n\n\"I felt my blood surge when the flag was waving on the screen,\" says 19-year-old college student Lin Jina. \"I never realized that I am such a patriot. All my friends and classmates are speaking so highly of the film. They are passionate about it, and I can understand why. I never thought I'd see such an exciting domestic movie. Wu Jing is a real fighter.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Wu disparaged critics who found the superhero's exploits a bit unconvincing.\n\n\"They asked how come I'm not killed in the film,\" Wu said. \"Well, you can watch an American movie where the hero beats a whole troop of armed soldiers without even getting a scratch and think he is super cool. You see a Chinese like me beating a handful of foreign mercenaries, and you say that I must die? Say what you will, but I despise those who think what's okay for American heroes is impossible for Chinese. There is nothing wrong with portraying Chinese soldiers as brave because that's how they are.\"\n\n\"The tanks are real cool. I love the part when they are drifting with the tanks -- super awesome. There are many illogical parts in the plot, like why the villain just keeps chasing them. He has finished his task and could have just taken the money and enjoyed the rest of his life. But action films are like that, right? You can't be too serious about that. After all, Leng Feng is a real man. It's better to watch him than pretty boys and girls in silly fantasy movies.\"\n\n\"I liked the first 'Wolf Warrior,' so we watched the sequel on the first weekend it was out. The theater was more crowded than ever. The first film was good but you could see it was small budget. It had a B-movie feel to it. This one is 10 times bigger and better.\"\n\n\"I was so excited to see Wu Jing waving the Chinese flag through the war zone. China is a great country and has a big impact in the world now, but we have been low-key for so many years that many of us are not used to this fact. I would love to see more of this. \"\n\n\"I'm so busy that I don't usually have time to go to cinemas. I don't actually remember the last Chinese movie I watched in a cinema. Usually I go for the Marvel movies or 'Fast and Furious' or 'The Expendables.' My son and wife both recommended 'Wolf Warrior,' saying I would definitely like it. It's got some exciting action, but overall it looks like a Hollywood blockbuster of 10 years ago.\n\nWu Jing is really cool in the film, especially because he is a kung fu guy in real life. I don't think the patriotic scenes stood out that much. It seemed a natural part of the plot. I look forward to the third one.\"\n\n\"It's a good movie, very entertaining and fast-paced. It's also got some humor. Patriotic movies are usually quite boring, but this one is different.\n\nIt's just a very good action movie that shows how tough and great Chinese soldiers are. I finally have some reason to go to the cinema, and the young people can watch some real movies with uplifting messages. I think they should make more of this kind of movie.\"\n\n\"'Wolf Warrior 2' is a superior sequel that hits the ground running and never lets up. Modern action films have become too sophisticated for their own good. Plots are overly convoluted with unnecessarily complicated character backstories, bloated run times and villains having overly complex motivations to be evil. 'Wolf Warrior 2' is a reminder of simpler times, when it's perfectly OK to have a straightforward story backed-up by identifiable characters, damsels-in-distress saved by the male hero, and two-dimensional villains who just enjoy being evil.\"\n\n\"While 'Wolf Warrior 2' is blandly generic more often than not, there's something bracing about its patriotic fervor, which asserts that the Chinese will act in the best interests of the world's downtrodden, while the rest of the world just exploits them. If nothing else, it's fascinating to see a film so closely mimic big-budget Hollywood war pictures, but from an opposing sociopolitical perspective.\"", "time": "16:03:00"}

"http://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/wolf-warrior-ii-review-1202524360/", "body": "Wu Jing's record-breaking Chinese-produced action-adventure gives audiences plenty of bang for their bucks.\n\nEarlier this week, \"Wolf Warrior II\" made the leap from smash hit to bona fide phenomenon, becoming the top grossing film released in its native China (more than $500 million in 12 days, and still counting). Like Sylvester Stallone before him, and John Wayne before Stallone, star Wu Jing (who also directs) has successfully exploited the crowd-pleasing potential of enhancing militaristic action-adventure heroics with a heavy dose of flag-waving patriotism. The big difference here, of course, is that the flag waved by Wu and others in this shoot-'em-up extravaganza is that of the People's Republic of China, and Wu's heroic Leng Feng is not a Green Beret, but rather a once and future member of his country's elite Wolf Warriors special ops unit.\n\nDepending on their own political leanings, some Westerners will be either amused or incensed by the full-throated nationalism that pervades \"Wolf Warrior II,\" and by the film's sporadic insistence that Chinese military forces are more resilient and reliable than those of any other country (like, say, U.S. Marines) when it comes to extracting its citizens from international hot spots. On the other hand, more apolitical moviegoers are likely to simply enjoy the runaway train of action set pieces that Wu propels with his flimsy but serviceable plot, and dismiss all the jingoist chest-thumping as roughly akin to John Rambo's stated desire to refight the Vietnam War -- and, dammit, win this time! -- in \"Rambo: First Blood Part II.\"\n\nAt the start of \"Wolf Warrior II,\" which Wu co-wrote with Dong Qun and Liu Yi, Feng takes care of business as a lone wolf, single-handedly dispatching a group of pirates intent attacking a freighter in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar. Flashbacks helpfully explain that he's working at a freelance security gig after being booted from his special ops unit (and serving three years in prison) for roughing up a loutish land developer who threatened the loved ones of a comrade who perished during the 2015 \"Wolf Warrior\" (also directed by and starring Wu).\n\nEven so, as Feng himself says, \"Once a Wolf Warrior, always a Wolf Warrior!\" Initially, he appears content to spend his time between jobs drinking and chilling in the port city of an unnamed African nation, with only occasional thoughts about Long Xiaoyun (Yu Nan), his missing and presumed-dead former lover, ever darkening his mood. But he just can't help being the right man in the wrong place at the right time.\n\nWhen revolutionaries cut a bloody swath through the city, during a thrillingly chaotic sequence that comes across as equal parts Paul Greengrass and Jackie Chan, Feng relies on his expertise with martial arts and automatic weapons to shepherd innocent bystanders through the fray and to the safety of the Chinese embassy. And when the commander of a Chinese battleship says he and his men are bound by international law not to do anything more than transport Chinese nationals (and a few locals) out of harm's way, Feng volunteers to become a one-man army for a rescue mission that takes him to a \"Chinese-invested\" hospital and a Chinese-financed factory complex that have been targeted by vicious mercenaries.\n\n\"Wolf Warrior II\" allows Wu the opportunity to evince greater charismatic wattage as an action-movie star than he did in the first \"Wolf Warrior.\" (One could argue that he was far more sympathetic in Soi Cheang's 2015 \"SPL 2: A Time for Consequences\" -- aka \"Kill Zone 2\" -- but, to be fair, that movie cast him as a bone-marrow donor to a leukemia-stricken little girl.) Better still, he develops three nicely differentiated styles of give-and-take with co-stars playing Wu's major allies: Celina Jade as a doctor seeking a cure for an infectious disease ravaging the African nation; Wu Gang as a seasoned Chinese army vet now in charge of security at the factory; and Hans Zhang as a second-generation army officer determined to prove his mettle under fire.\n\nBut the performances ultimately serve as so much window dressing during the virtually nonstop cavalcade of rough stuff, ranging from hand-to-hand combat to an assault by armed drones to cleverly choreographed tank battles, that Wu Jing has conceived in concert with action directors Wai Leung Wong (\"Operation Mekong\") and Sam Hargrave (\"Atomic Blonde\"). It would appear Wu heeded the comments of disappointed fans (and movie critics) who complained that Feng's climatic grudgep-match with the chief villain (Scott Adkins) in the first \"Wolf Warrior\" was disappointingly brief. Here, he gives us a satisfyingly extended one-on-one battle between Feng and Big Daddy (snarling and scenery-chewing Frank Grillo), the sadistic leader of the mercenary band.\n\nWu skillfully amps the suspense during the final confrontation by effectively underscoring it with, of all things, a supporting character's impassioned rendition of \"Amazing Grace.\" It's probably wise not to read any religious subtext into the director's choice of the hymn -- in this context, it's used pretty much the same way Ennio Morricone's nondenominational score was employed in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns.\n\nThe epilogue of \"Wolf Warrior II\" promises a forthcoming \"Wolf Warrior III.\" Judging from the box office returns for this chapter in what promises to be an ongoing franchise, let's just say Wu and his producers were not merely confident -- they were downright prescient.", "time": "06:19:00"}

eclipsed the mark held by Stephen Chow's 'The Mermaid.'\n\nWolf Warrior 2 became the biggest grossing film ever at the Chinese box office after collecting a massive $571 million after 14 days.\n\nThe action movie took the crown from Stephen Chow's fantasy phenomenon The Mermaid, which earned $527 million during its theatrical run last year. Wolf Warrior 2 also relegated The Fate of the Furious, the most successful Hollywood title in China ever, down to third place.\n\nWolf Warrior 2 started big with a $130 million debut, but it has really turned heads with its second weekend gross of $161 million.\n\nWolf Warrior 2's performance is even starker as the first film in the franchise, released in 2015, made a so-so $89.1 million. Moreover, the film was released in the summer months in China, not traditionally seen as a period to make box office hay. The Chinese New Year holiday season, which usually falls in late January and early February, is still the most lucrative period in the release calendar and can turbo charge earnings as it did for The Mermaid did in 2016 and Jackie Chan's Kung Fu Yoga ($252 million) earlier this year.\n\nDespite its summer release, Wolf Warrior 2 has been the biggest beneficiary of the summer blackout of Hollywood films in China, an attempt by the authorities to give local productions a clear run. But the lack of foreign competition alone doesn't account for the stellar success of Wolf Warrior 2, judging by social media engagement the film has struck a chord with Chinese audiences with its overt patriotism and intense and top-quality action scenes.\n\nWritten, directed, produced and starring Wu Jing, the film reportedly cost $30 million to make and co-stars Hong Konger Celina Jade and token Hollywood import Frank Grillo (an upgrade on Scott Adkins from the first film). The action takes place in Africa, where a team of Chinese special forces is tasked with freeing their compatriots being held by mercenaries.\n\nAn undoubted domestic triumph, there are Hollywood fingerprints on the film. Joe and Anthony Russo, co-directors of the Captain America franchise and the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War, were consultants on the film via their Chinese studio venture Anthem & Song, which has a strategic partnership with Beijing Culture Media Company, one of the local production companies behind Wolf Warrior 2. The Russos' go-to stunt team, led by veteran action coordinator Sam Hargrave, were a key element behind the highly praised action and fight sequences in Wolf Warrior 2.\n\nLikened to Rambo, Wolf Warriors 2 unashamedly harkens back to the testosterone- and patriotism-fuelled Hollywood films of the 1980s, but this time with a Chinese hero saving the day.", "time": "11:40:00"}

hears a wolf at the door, it may well be Chinese director-producer-star turned uber wolfpack leader, Wu Jing, whose recent effort, \"Wolf Warrior II\", has gobbled up the competition to become a genuine cultural phenomenon, not only in China, but also for Hollywood.\n\nAfter shocked by the movie's performance in box office, raking in 650 million U.S. dollars since July 28 to this weekend in China alone, some critics, like Film Journal International, contend that it's because \"'Wolf Warrior II' is like a propaganda movie, with Leng even unfurling a Chinese flag at one point to assure safe passage through a war zone.\"\n\nBut more critics shrugged off the prejudice, just like the Rotten Tomatoes.com only gave the movie a 50 percent on their tomatometer while it scored 88 percent on their audience approval score.\n\n\"Like Sylvester Stallone before him, and John Wayne before Stallone, star Wu Jing has successfully exploited the crowd-pleasing potential of enhancing militaristic action-adventure heroics with a heavy dose of flag-waving patriotism,\" the Variety argued in the latest report about the movie published Friday.\n\n\"The big difference here, of course, is that the flag waved by Wu and others in this shoot-'em-up extravaganza is that of the People's Republic of China, and Wu's heroic Leng Feng is not a Green Beret, but rather a once and future member of his country's elite Wolf Warriors special ops unit,\" the report said.\n\nItalian-American co-star, Frank Grillo, who compellingly plays the blood-thirsty mercenary antagonist, \"Big Daddy\", rebutted it as well, \"It's Chinese nationalistic, not propaganda. It's no more propaganda than 'Rambo'.\"\n\nGrillo, best known for his portrayal of famed Marvel comic book character, \"Crossbones\" in Disney's blockbuster \"Captain America\" franchise, sang Wu Jing's praises in an exclusive interview with Xinhua Thursday, \"He's a special man who's got his finger on the pulse of what politically and emotionally charges his country. He understands China's Zeitgeist.\"\n\nWu also dismisses this criticism, while readily admitting his film is \"a combination of a commercial action movie and a Chinese military propaganda movie.\" During a recent press conference, he angrily retorted, \"Why is that a problem? America makes movies that promote the American spirit. Why can't I do that for China?\"\n\nAnd many of his countrymen agree. Though Wu may still be learning the narrative nuances that would enable his films to appeal to international audiences as well, Chinese audiences voted with their wallets, sending \"Wolf Warrior II\" snarling to a record-breaking first place as the highest grossing movie in China's history.\n\n\"Wu Jing's 'sturm und drang' is making Hollywood sit up and take notice,\" Grillo told Xinhua.\n\n\"I've got about 15 calls from Hollywood studio people, casting people and producers, asking, 'Can Wu Jing speak English?'\" revealed Grillo. \"Wu Jing can do anything. He's breathing very thin air right now and is in a room with very few other people.\"\n\nCelina Jade, Chinese-American singer-turned-actress who plays the beautiful doctor in the movie, echoed Grillo's words.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Xinhua last week, she recounted, \"Wu Jing called me the very last minute and said, 'I'm doing a movie and I need a lead actress. Can you fly tonight?' I really wanted to help because my acting career wouldn't exist if it weren't for this guy pushing me forward ... I knew this was my opportunity to help him back.\"\n\n\"On top of that, my Mom is Chinese and she was worried I was losing my heritage and roots. She wanted me to do it,\" Jane said.\n\nShe emphasized that Hollywood can noticed that this movie is far more technically sophisticated than a typical B-movie and easily outstrips Wu Jing's franchise-founding predecessor, \"Wolf Warrior\", as Wu clearly styled himself after Sylvester Stallone's \"Rambo\" with more than a pinch of Jackie Chan thrown in for good measure.\n\n\"It is an amazing movie first,\" both Grillo and Jade used the same words before involved in the controversy.\n\nThe film uses high-production value cinematography, complete with sweeping aerial and crane shots, massive underwater and high action, military set pieces featuring deadly drones, seagoing vessels and marauding tanks.\n\nThere's also no shortage of gut-pummeling, hand-to-hand combat scenes and elaborate stunt sequences designed by Marvel's top stunt master, Sam Hargrave (\"Captain America\", \"Hunger Games\"), along with China's fight choreographer Wai Leung Wong (\"Operation Mekong\").\n\nHargrave said at a recent press conference, \"It' s a big movie and a big challenge. With 50 to 100 explosions, it's like the 'Fast and Furious' with a tank!\"\n\nClearly, Wu's type of explosive, flag-waving, nationalistic action-adventure strikes a deep chord with Chinese audiences. What remains to be seen is whether, like Jackie Chan before him, Wu Jing can make the leap from homegrown superstar to a global box office draw.\n\nGrillo's prediction? \"The next iteration for Chinese and American cultures is: we go in and make movies that both cultures can connect to.\"\n\nRescuers continue search in quake-hit Jiuzhaigou\n\nFireworks illuminate sky over Leman Lake during Geneva Festival in Switzerland\n\nAt least one dead in car crash after violent rally in Virginia, U.S.\n\n8 security personnel among 15 killed in Pakistan's Quetta blast", "time": "07:47:00"}

Warrior 2 the other day.\n\nThe movie, directed by and starring Chinese filmmaker and martial artist Wu Jing, has been the talk of the town since its release on July 27.\n\nAlready the highest-grossing film ever to be shown on the mainland, Wolf Warrior 2 has earned about 3.5 billion yuan (US$5.25 billion) as of last Wednesday at the box office.\n\nAs an ordinary movie-goer, I was more fixated on the film per se than the box office takings or the implications it has for the Chinese film market.\n\nA sequel to Wolf Warrior that premiered in 2015, Wolf Warrior 2 has an even more gripping storyline. The plot is centered on an ex-PLA Special Forces soldier, played to perfection by Wu, who almost single-handedly led Chinese expats and other refugees on an odyssey fleeing a war-torn and plagued-ravaged country.\n\nThe massive use of state-of-the-art weapons, the bloody combat scenes, the close-quarter fighting all gave the viewers an adrenaline rush. As I sat in a packed theater, the gunfire, rumbling of tanks and explosion of shells sent my heart racing.\n\nThe movie is thinly veiled in its attempt to instill patriotic ardor and pride in the mainly Chinese audience as part of its scenes is clearly inspired by real events.\n\nWe still recall how China managed to evacuate, with stunning efficiency, tens of thousands of its nationals on the cusp of civil wars in Libya and certain other countries a few years ago.\n\nIn a certain way, Wolf Warrior 2 is a paean to the way China committed itself to rescuing its nationals stranded in hot spots abroad.\n\nThe patriotic overtone is a major reason the film is highly commended. But what I find more interesting about it is that it has popularized a new genre in Chinese cinema: military-themed movies.\n\nIn recent years, Chinese cinema and TV have been invaded, and almost colonized, by a plethora of commercial potboilers about urban romance, infidelity, material desire and not much else.\n\nThe result is that Chinese cinematic works are becoming bland and kitschy; worse, they strengthen stereotypes about the showbiz industry that it produces nothing but wimps.\n\nIndeed, a lot of criticisms have been heaped on the cult of so-called xiao xian rou, literally \"little fresh meat,\" meaning good-looking teenage idols that many women swoon over.\n\nThe good times for xiao xian rou -- effeminate, camp and appealing to some women's maternal instincts -- seem to be coming to an end as the bored audience desires something new, something more masculine, and something catering to the mentality of a rising nation.\n\nIn a word, we need our tough guys, we need our Sylvester Stallone or Jason Statham. At this point Wu came along with his Wolf Warrior series and naturally made a big splash.\n\nThe film is not without critics, though. For example, the combat scenes showing Wu and a few comrades pulling through relatively unscathed from clashes with marauding rebel troops and well-trained mercenaries are indeed exaggerated, even surreal. And the accusation that the film promotes Rambo-like individual heroism is not entirely unreasonable.\n\nArtistic merit\n\nBut these criticisms may pale in comparison to its overall artistic merit. Although I consider myself an art-house film buff, and have been quite unfamiliar with military-themed works released in recent years, I have no doubt that the Wolf Warriors series has a good chance of entering the hall of fame shared by the likes of the First Blood series or the Expendables trio.\n\nIn fact, sections of Wolf Warrior 2 did remind me of thrillers set in African war zones, such as Bruce Willis's Tears of the Sun (2003) or the Blood Diamond (2005). And the tank fight toward the end was obviously inspired by Brad Pitt's performance in the Fury (2014).\n\nI don't know to what extent Wu took cues from all the blockbusters that went before, but Wolf Warrior 2, combing elements old and new, foreign and domestic, is a success in its own right.\n\nWhile many are placing bets on whether the box office takings of Wolf Warrior 2 could top 4 billion yuan, a less-often asked question is what its immense success entails.\n\nAnyone following Wu's cinematic career for some time now can tell that he is a stranger to the current surge to super-stardom.\n\nHe was widely tipped to replace Jet Li as the next kung fu emperor but somehow failed to come up with works that met critics' expectations -- until the Wolf Warriors series appeared.\n\nBut at what cost? He reportedly reinvented himself by staying and training with a real PLA Special Forces unit for 18 months. That spell set the stage for the Wolf Warrior series. The many grueling days of hard training have paid off.\n\nHow many of the junior actors today would be willing to sacrifice their unearned comfort for a chance to be chastened through the fire and flames?", "time": "17:37:00"}

best-ever action hero film -- \"Wolf Warrior 2\" -- but I haven't quite been caught in the testosterone-filled box-office behemoth's golden spell.\n\nDon't get me wrong. It's a decent film production-wise, with good cinematography and exhilaratingly well-choreographed and executed action scenes worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster. But it's the blatant nationalism, and the tinges of racism, that left me with a sour taste in the mouth.\n\nI'm proud of many aspects of China, from her ability to pull hundreds of millions from poverty in such a short span of time, to getting me from Shanghai to Beijing in just over four hours.\n\nAnd I can feel a sense of national pride, even as a foreigner living here, without being told to do it on cue. That's what it felt like watching \"Wolf Warrior 2\" -- a blatant, over-the-top advertisement of patriotism, not seen since Captain America.\n\nIt's great to feel a sense of pride for one's country, but \"Wolf Warrior 2\" is cashing in on a hunger for patriotism in an incessant and painful manner. It left me rolling my eyes at nearly every turn.\n\nThe most stomach-churning instance -- and this is going to get me in trouble because a lot of people are fans of the movie -- was when the film's hero, played by Wu Jing, sits atop a vehicle at the head of a Chinese motorcade about to drive through a war zone. He drapes a Chinese flag over his arm and the group throw down all arms, and suddenly the war halt, if just for a few minutes: \"Hold your fire, they're Chinese!\" the African warlords shouts as the five-starred red flag proudly sways, in slow motion, through the sub-Saharan heat.\n\nI expect this from American films, but I know China can do better.\n\nThe treatment of African people in the film is another thing that did not sit comfortably with me in \"Wolf Warrior 2.\" It's always a bit tough talking about racism in China because, in this largely homogenous society, people genuinely don't think of race and race relations in the same way that Westerners do, which is great in many ways. But I'm a Westerner, so it's hard for me to ignore a point of view I've grown up with.\n\nAfrican people in the film are portrayed as either vulnerable and in dire need of outside help, or savage and violent in turns. One scene in the film, set in a Chinese-funded factory with largely African workers, probably crosses the line. Chinese factory managers, in an attempt to calm workers down while in the midst of impending doom, lights bonfires inside the warehouse and gives the workers alcohol. It results in the African workers dancing around the fire chanting like tribespeople. \"Give these people a bonfire and they're happy,\" the Chinese boss exclaims, or something to that effect.\n\nBut at the end of the day, probably the main reason I didn't really enjoy \"Wolf Warrior 2\" is that I'm not an action movie fan. As a workmate told me, this film is really just a way to sit back, enjoy the explosions -- and especially the opening underwater scene -- and stop thinking for two hours.\n\nI like her advice, and I promise I'll try harder next time.", "time": "16:03:00"}

25-year-old behind Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus in the battle for the number nine position.\n\nThe former England Under-21 international had to settle for just 10 starts in 27 Premier League appearances last term, mustering only five goals and two assists.\n\nNketiah could see his minutes reduce further if were to remain in North London, with the Gunners believed to be on the lookout for a new striker.\n\nAs a result of his current situation, the Arsenal man is seemingly open to a move away to gain regular playing time elsewhere.\n\nMarseille submit fresh Nketiah offer\n\nMarseille have been leading the race for his signature as they look to strengthen their forward options following Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's departure.\n\nHowever, the Ligue 1 club have struggled to make progress in negotiations, having failed to meet Arsenal's valuation with their opening two offers.\n\nArsenal are believed to be holding out for around \u00a330m for a player who is currently under contract until the summer of 2027.\n\nAccording to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Marseille have sent a fresh proposal to Arsenal as they look to make a breakthrough in their pursuit of Nketiah.\n\nThe update claims that Marseille are happy to restart negotiations, but they are seemingly reluctant to stray too far from their own valuation of the player.\n\nMarseille keen to continue summer overhaul\n\nMarseille are determined to add Nketiah to a squad that has undergone a considerable rebuild ahead of Roberto De Zerbi's first season in charge.\n\nThe French club have already recruited two players from the Premier League this summer, signing Mason Greenwood from Manchester United on a permanent transfer and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg from Tottenham Hotspur on an initial loan deal.\n\nThey have also signed Derek Cornelius, Jeffrey de Lange, Lilian Brassier, Ismael Kone, Bamo Meite and Valentin Carboni.\n\nFrom Arsenal's perspective, they are looking to sell another academy graduate for a considerable fee after offloading Emile Smith Rowe to Fulham in a \u00a334m deal earlier this month.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType":

He would receive regular game time and join a team who should comfortably remain in the Premier League beyond the season.\n\nBut will the west London side pay his fee after signing Smith Rowe? Probably not.\n\nFit? 3/10\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers must improve in front of goal, so why not sign a striker who bagged five Premier League goals last season?\n\nIt seems plausible that Pedro Neto could be on his way out, with both Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool keen to fight for the winger, so Nketiah could be a good replacement at the top of end of the pitch.\n\nHowever, Wolves may be reluctant to pay the money that Arsenal will deman, and therefore may choose to look the other way.\n\nFit? 4/10\n\nCrystal Palace could offer an exciting move, and with the departure of Michael Olise to Bayern Munich, they'll be looking to bolster their attack.\n\nPalace seemed keen to bring Nketiah to south London back in January, but could now make a stronger case to facilitate his move. He'd be a valued player at Palace and would benefit from less pressure than he currently faces at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nFit? 5/10\n\nMarseille seem to be firmly in pole position to land Nketiah this summer, if he decides a move to France is the route he wants to take.\n\nArsenal have already rejected a bid from the Ligue 1 side, but the Gunners could soften their stance on his asking price as the window progresses. Marseille are also eyeing up a move for Elye Wahi though - and if they can procure him for cheaper then they will turn their back on Nketiah.\n\nA move to France could be appealing for Nketiah, who could be on the lookout for a fresh chance away from the Premier League.\n\nFit? 7/10\n\nOkay, if Bournemouth are to lose Dominic Solanke this summer, Eddie Nketiah could be a genuinely good replacement.\n\nSolanke has gained the attention of a number of clubs, with Spurs seemingly leading the way for his signature.

The north Londoners have struggled to sell in recent seasons, with their record sale remaining Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for around \u00a335 million to Liverpool, back in 2017.\n\nBut with Arteta wanting to bring in new signings, exits are a necessity, as the club looks to reduce the wage bill.\n\nVIDEO Riccardo Calafiori Is The FINAL Piece Of Mikel Arteta's Jigsaw\n\nThe Athletic's David Ornstein now writes that Arsenal have put together a new package for Marseille to mull over over Eddie Nketiah leaving.\n\nThe centre-forward has found playing time increasingly difficult to come by at Arsenal, starting just ten Premier League games this season - the last of which was on New Year's Eve - and sitting on the bench for the last six games of the campaign. That has led the club to look for a new home for the 25-year-old, with Roberto de Zerbi's Marseille expressing an interest and agreeing personal terms with Nketiah but yet to meet Arsenal's asking price.\n\nThe Ligue 1 side's most recent offer last month was reportedly in the region of \u20ac20m (\u00a316.8m), which was closer to what Arsenal wanted but still not enough to give the deal the green light. Arsenal have now proposed a season-long loan with an obligation to buy Nketiah next summer for a \u20ac30m (\u00a325.2m) permanent transfer fee, and are awaiting Marseille's reply.\n\nNketiah is a graduate of Arsenal's academy and reached double figures of goals in all competitions in 2021/22, but has never quite been able to make the number 9 role his own.\n\nKai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus were both preferred as Mikel Arteta's centre-forward as Arsenal mounted an ultimately unsuccessful challenge on the Premier League title. The Gunners pushed Manchester City all the way to the final day of the season, but victories for both sides meant Arsenal finished two points shy of first place.\n\nIt's been revealed that Mikel Arteta used professional pickpockets to teach his players a lesson.

Nketiah made a 20-minute cameo appearance in the pre-season victory over Bayer Leverkusen and after the match, the Arsenal boss admitted that the striker is pushing for more game time.\n\nfootball.london understands Marseille are leading the race for the Englishman and it is widely expected that Roberto De Zerbi's side will get the deal over the line for a reported \u00a325m fee. However, CoinPoker.com has enlisted the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and it appears that there could be a better deal out there for Arsenal.\n\nAI predicts that Borussia Dortmund will look to swoop in at the last possible moment and seal a \u00a328m deal for Nketiah. It is claimed the Bundesliga club will be keen to bring in a replacement for Niclas Fullkrug sooner rather than later after he made the switch to West Ham United.\n\nWhile Nketiah is a different profile to the German striker, it is predicted they will be keen to battle Marseille for the Arsenal striker. Unfortunately for both Arteta and perhaps Aaron Ramsdale too, it is also predicted that the England goalkeeper will not be leaving the club this summer.\n\nThe AI added that interest in Ramsdale is unlikely to materialise before the August 30 deadline and the 26-year-old will have to settle as David Raya's understudy at least until January. Ramsdale was an unused substitute in midweek for the victory over Leverkusen.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_flintham@football.london", "name": "Jack Flintham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Nketiah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Nketiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edu_(footballer,_born_1978)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edu (footballer, born 1978)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_de_Marseille", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympique de Marseille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Ramsdale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Ramsdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29711813.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154049934.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803504", "eventUri": "eng-9803504", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-30", "textStart": 1481, "textEnd": 1490}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

(AP) \u2014 Jhonder C\u00e1diz and Eduard Bello scored second-half goals after subbing on at halftime and Venezuela rallied for a 2-1 win over short-handed Ecuador on Saturday night in the opening round of group play at the Copa America. Enner Valencia, who went into the tournament expected to lead Ecuador\u2019s attack, was shown a straight red card in the 22nd minute and Ecuador played a man down the rest of the way. Ecuador, however, took a 1-0 lead in the 40th minute when Jeremy Sarmiento took advantage of a failed clearance of a free kick into the area by Kendry P\u00e1ez. C\u00e1diz played a one-touch shot from 15-yards out to make it 1-1 in the 64th minute. Bello scored on a putback from point-blank range to give Venezuela a 2-1 lead in the 74th minute. Alexander Gonz\u00e1lez played an arcing entry from the right side to the center of the area and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n\u2019s diving header was parried by goalkeeper Alexander Dom\u00ednguez and Bello took advantage. Rond\u00f3n returned to the starting lineup after scoring as a substitute in the team\u2019s last friendly match. Ecuador, which entered the tournament ranked 30th in the FIFA rankings, plays Wednesday against Jamaica at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Venezuela, ranked 54th, plays Mexico on Wednesday at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Venezuelan fans could be heard chanting, \u201cY va a car, y va a caer, este gobierno va a caer,\u201d which translates to \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to fall, and it\u2019s going to fall, this government is going to fall.\u201d The chant comes ahead of the country\u2019s presidential election on July 28. Ecuador lost for just the second time in its last last 10 encounters against Venezuela in all competitions (4-5-2). The only other time Venezuela beat Ecuador at the Copa America was 1-0 in 2011. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VjdWFkb3ItdmVuZXp1ZWxhLWNvcGEtYW1lcmljYS1zY29yZS0xZmUyYTY1MGQwMDRhOWIxOWIzNzQ3ZDdiNzA1ZjA4ZdIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">C\u00e1diz, Bello each score a goal, Venezuela beats short-handed Ecuador 2-1 at Copa America</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-venezuela-copa-america-score-1fe2a650d004a9b19b3747d7b705f08e", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/0f46407/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3017x1697+0+157/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F0e%2Ffa%2Fbe6dc64d3f087e02106b8d4a4fff%2F46c307f57f5f4aa8b64f51554f8cbe95", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:16:25", "author": "Kendry P", "authors": ["Kendry P"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.057}

Earlier, head coach Igor Stimac had named a 23-member squad to travel for the fixture. Apart from captain Sunil Chhetri, who retired after his last game for the country against Kuwait on Thursday, defenders Amey Ranawade, Lalchungnunga and Subhasish Bose did not travel to Qatar. Bose was released on his request because of personal reasons. About Ranawade and Lalchungnunga, Stimac said, \u201cI was happy to have both of them with us. We worked on various aspects of their game for the future. We had a nice talk before we released them and they know which parts of their game they need to grow for the upcoming season. I hope both of them will use the time ahead to improve and come back stronger.\u201d As far as the captain\u2019s armband is concerned, Stimac mentioned that it was a no-brainer to hand it to Gurpreet Singh Sandhu for Tuesday\u2019s match. With 72 caps, the 32-year-old is now the most experienced and longest-serving player in the national team after Chhetri\u2019s departure. The match between Qatar and India will be streamed live on FanCode. \u2013IANS hs", "summary": "<p>Doha, June 9 (IANS) Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has been named India captain for the crucial tie against Qatar in the FIFA World Cup 2026 and AFC Asian Cup 2027 Preliminary&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/gurpreet-sandhu-named-indian-captain-for-the-crucial-tie-against-qatar/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Gurpreet Sandhu named Indian captain for the crucial tie against Qatar</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/gurpreet-sandhu-named-indian-captain-for-the-crucial-tie-against-qatar/\">Gurpreet Sandhu named Indian captain for the crucial tie against Qatar</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/gurpreet-sandhu-named-indian-captain-for-the-crucial-tie-against-qatar/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202406093172773.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:34:29", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": 0.286}

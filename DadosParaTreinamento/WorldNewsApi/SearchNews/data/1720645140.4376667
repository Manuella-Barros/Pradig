{"id": 231359824, "title": "Four cute games surprise launch at Wholesome Direct", "text": "Saturday\u2019s Wholesome Direct showcased dozens of (yes, wholesome) games, including four that surprise launched alongside the event. Four whole games! Those games are Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, POOOOL, The Palace on the Hill, and Tracks of Thought. All are available on Windows PC Steam, but you\u2019ll also find Kamaeru on itch.io and Nintendo Switch; The Palace on the Hill on Android, Apple iOS, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X; and Tracks of Thought on Windows PC via the Epic Games Store. Kamaera is basically a frog farming simulator, where you\u2019re essentially setting up a habitat for your frogs to thrive, while POOOOL is a physics puzzle game that sounds like a twisted Suika Game. Meanwhile, The Palace on the Hill is a slice-of-life game about life in rural India in the \u201990s and Tracks of Thought is a card-based mystery solving ride. They all couldn\u2019t be more different, but each looks delightfully wholesome all the same. Beyond the four surprise released games, the Wholesome Direct was not short on games to get excited for. Some that I\u2019m looking forward to include Squeakross: Home Squeak Home, which is mouse Picross; \u00c9t\u00e9, a watercolor painting simulator; Sopa: Tale of the Stolen Potato, an adventure game about getting a potato for your grandma\u2019s soup; While Waiting, a silly game that makes you wait around; Tiny Bookshop, which has a new demo available; and Wax Heads, where you run a record store. There were too many incredible looking games shown during the Wholesome Direct to list here, so if you missed the show, I\u2019d recommend watching it for yourself. There\u2019s a lot to look forward to in the next couple of years.", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/24171519/wholesome-games-direct-june-2024-showcase-trailers", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajnRyAnsxB--kSUa97p-iSxqLdI=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25477679/POOOOL_Screenshot_03.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:00:00", "author": "Nicole Carpenter", "authors": ["Nicole Carpenter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.12}

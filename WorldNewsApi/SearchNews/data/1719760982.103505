Additional examples of such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: (i) Mullen\u2019s ability (or inability) to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed; (ii) Mullen\u2019s ability to maintain existing, and secure additional, contracts with manufacturers, parts and other service providers relating to its business; (iii) Mullen\u2019s ability to successfully expand in existing markets and enter new markets; (iv) Mullen\u2019s ability to successfully manage and integrate any acquisitions of businesses, solutions or technologies; (v) unanticipated operating costs, transaction costs and actual or contingent liabilities; (vi) the ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel; (vii) adverse effects of increased competition on Mullen\u2019s business; (viii) changes in government licensing and regulation that may adversely affect Mullen\u2019s business; (ix) the risk that changes in consumer behavior could adversely affect Mullen\u2019s business; (x) Mullen\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property; and (xi) local, industry and general business and economic conditions. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements can be found in the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed by Mullen with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mullen anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its plans, intentions and expectations to change. Mullen assumes no obligation, and it specifically disclaims any intention or obligation, to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by law. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing Mullen\u2019s plans and expectations as of any subsequent date.

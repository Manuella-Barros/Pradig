{"id": 231382806, "title": "7 Of The Best Apartment Air Conditioners To Keep You Cool This Summer, According To Reviews", "text": "Lightweight and compact, this portable AC unit has wheels for extra movement and functions as a dehumidifier and fan in addition to an air conditioner. It provides maximum air circulation for smaller spaces with its automatic swing mode setting. You can use the buttons on the machine or control it with the remote from across the room. Promising review: \u201cI spent months reading reviews on portable ACs before finally hitting the purchase button. This unit was neck and neck with another unit. There is NO unit out there with five-star reviews so it just came down to what I thought was the best and paying attention to consistencies in other reviews. The unit arrived safe and sound and was extremely easy to install. Almost too easy. I do recommend getting window strips to help seal around where the hose goes out the window. My apartment is pretty small - 630 sq. ft. and becomes a SAUNA due to poor insulation and no protection from the sun...We've had a few 80 degree days here already so I was excited to put this unit to the test and I have been pleasantly pleased! I can feel the cool air right away when I turn it on and while it doesn't get my apartment down below 80, it feels GREAT! I can actually sit comfortably and not feel like I'm sweating just blinking my eyes. ...So thankful for this unit! My heat box has now turned into a comfortable apartment. ...As far as electricity - It has not done anything significant to my electric bill. Of course, I don't leave it running 24/7. And, thankfully, as mentioned before, the heat waves around here aren't too prolonged. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a portable AC unit or at least some type of AC that is more affordable than the alternative.\u201d \u2014MelissaE Get it from Amazon for $304.57+ (available in six styles).", "summary": "<h1>Whether you\u2019re in the market for a window unit or portable option, these ACs will help you beat the summer heat.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/4/5/enhanced/897b40382ba0/original-475-1717479833-2.jpg?crop=1243:829;0,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/griffinwynne1/best-air-conditioner-units-apartment\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/griffinwynne1/best-air-conditioner-units-apartment", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-05/29/20/campaign_images/71e0bec8c4fe/7-of-the-best-apartment-air-conditioners-to-keep--3-828-1717015870-1_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:31:02", "author": "Griffin Wynne,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Griffin Wynne", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.149}

It had intervened to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998 a few weeks before.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nGEOFF YU, SENIOR MACRO STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON, LONDON:\n\n\"Our view is that rate differentials are clearly converging as a September (U.S.) rate cut is priced in.\"\n\n\"Hard data also shows yen shorts are the strongest in almost three years and quite extreme so there's no resistance to the upside.\"\n\nMARC CHANDLER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BANNOCKBURN GLOBAL FOREX, NEW YORK\n\n\"I'd be surprised if they are, partly because of the time zone and partly because the dollar is responding to fundamentals as we would expect - softer CPI, lower U.S. rates, and of course dollar/yen falls... I think the market got caught leading the wrong way.\"\n\n\"I think there's three broad conditions. Volatility, and volatility is not very high, it wasn't going into today. Secondly, I think they care about a one-way market, and it hasn't been really a one-way market for a couple of weeks. And thirdly, I think about how the dollar reacts to fundamentals, and this is responding in line with fundamentals. So, the three broad criteria I don't think are met.\"\n\nGIUSEPPE SERSALE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ANTHILIA, MILAN\n\n\"The yen is currently making fireworks. Honestly, I couldn't say exactly what's driving it. If the movement persists, it could mean that short-term positioning was too skewed towards short yen. And this US data created a situation where there was a violent rebound and a series of stop losses for those short on yen.\"\n\n\"If, however, the movement deflates, halves during the day, or becomes very erratic, it means there was also a contribution from the Japanese Treasury, who at this moment doesn't admit it... the move however seems excessive since the euro is gaining half a point, the pound is gaining half a point, and so on. Therefore, I have the impression that there is also a bit of contribution from the Japanese.\"\n\nJAMES MALCOLM, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, UBS LONDON:\n\n\"My personal guess is that this is not intervention.\"\n\n\"The thing is the market position is so, so extended that it can feed on itself very, very easily, Regardless of whether you think it should be stabilising, if dollar-yen is dropping and you're long, you have to get out... that's the definition of a classic carry unwind.\"\n\n\"There is an incentive to perhaps to do a little bit of intervention later in the day to ensure it doesn't rebound.\"\n\nKENNETH BROUX, HEAD OF CORPORATE RESEARCH FX AND RATES, SOCIETE GENERALE\n\n\"It's certainly a big move but I don't think we can say it's anything to do with intervention,\" said Societe Generale's head of corporate research FX and rates Kenneth Broux.\n\n\"The US CPI has been a trigger and it's more about stops being triggered than intervention,\" he said.\n\nSTEVE ENGLANDER, HEAD, GLOBAL G10 FX RESEARCH AND NORTH AMERICA MACRO STRATEGY, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK NY BRANCH, NEW YORK\n\n\"Obviously the yen story has been a rate differential story and positions - long dollar/yen positions - have piled up.

It had intervened to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998 a few weeks before.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nMARC CHANDLER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BANNOCKBURN GLOBAL FOREX, NEW YORK\n\n\"I'd be surprised if they are, partly because of the time zone and partly because the dollar is responding to fundamentals as we would expect - softer CPI, lower U.S. rates, and of course dollar/yen falls... I think the market got caught leading the wrong way.\"\n\n\"I think there's three broad conditions. Volatility, and volatility is not very high, it wasn't going into today. Secondly, I think they care about a one-way market, and it hasn't been really a one-way market for a couple of weeks. And thirdly, I think about how the dollar reacts to fundamentals, and this is responding in line with fundamentals. So, the three broad criteria I don't think are met.\"\n\nGIUSEPPE SERSALE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ANTHILIA, MILAN\n\n\"The yen is currently making fireworks. Honestly, I couldn't say exactly what's driving it. If the movement persists, it could mean that short-term positioning was too skewed towards short yen. And this US data created a situation where there was a violent rebound and a series of stop losses for those short on yen.\"\n\n\"If, however, the movement deflates, halves during the day, or becomes very erratic, it means there was also a contribution from the Japanese Treasury, who at this moment doesn't admit it... the move however seems excessive since the euro is gaining half a point, the pound is gaining half a point, and so on. Therefore, I have the impression that there is also a bit of contribution from the Japanese.\"\n\nAMES MALCOLM, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, UBS LONDON:\n\n\"My personal guess is that this is not intervention.\"\n\n\"The thing is the market position is so, so extended that it can feed on itself very, very easily, Regardless of whether you think it should be stabilising, if dollar-yen is dropping and you're long, you have to get out... that's the definition of a classic carry unwind.\"\n\n\"There is an incentive to perhaps to do a little bit of intervention later in the day to ensure it doesn't rebound.\"\n\nKENNETH BROUX, HEAD OF CORPORATE RESEARCH FX AND RATES, SOCIETE GENERALE\n\n\"It's certainly a big move but I don't think we can say it's anything to do with intervention,\" said Societe Generale's head of corporate research FX and rates Kenneth Broux.\n\n\"The US CPI has been a trigger and it's more about stops being triggered than intervention,\" he said.\n\nSTEVE ENGLANDER, HEAD, GLOBAL G10 FX RESEARCH AND NORTH AMERICA MACRO STRATEGY, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK NY BRANCH, NEW YORK\n\n\"Obviously the yen story has been a rate differential story and positions - long dollar/yen positions - have piled up. So when you get a number that's this definitive in terms of making, say, September highly probable and kind of reinstating the disinflation story, that rate differential story erodes. Most likely it was cleaning up of positions because my sense from clients, especially short-term traders, is that everybody had some long dollar/yen on that they were thinking that maybe 165 or higher was kind of where it was headed.\"\n\n\"There's some vague speculation on intervention, just everybody's looking at the price chart and kind of saying, oh, that's, kind of a sharp drop so maybe could have it been. The answer is it could have, but I'd say most likely its position squaring rather than any official moves.\"\n\nLEE HARDMAN, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, MUFG, LONDON\n\nWhen the market is heavily positioned in one direction and then it goes the other way it can trigger this kind of abrupt move. Dollar/yen long positioning was very stretched\n\nCOLIN ASHER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO, LONDON\n\n\"Most likely, it's just short covering, as speculation of US rate cuts on the horizon build in the wake of the negative CPI print.\"\n\n\"USD/JPY is the G10 pair where positioning is most stretched.\"\n\n\"It's certainly a sizable move, with the intra-day range the biggest since the intervention at the start of May.\"", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Chandler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Chandler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9_G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizuho_Financial_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mizuho Financial Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_UFJ_Financial_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chartered", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard Chartered"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--djoRvJXZ--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-07-11t133204z_1_lynxmpek6a0hc_rtroptp_3_svb-financial-group-stock.jpg?itok=MJaNSf6V", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724765", "eventUri": "eng-9724765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

It was the yen's biggest daily rise since late 2022, according to Reuters.\n\nThe dollar rose as the U.S. reacted to its lowest CPI (consumer price index) reading in more than four years. Some currency experts highlighted the U.S. data for the yen move, with Kit Juckes, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Societe Generale, telling CNBC via email that the \"driver of the yen rally is big shorts and a surprise in CPI.\" Shorting involves betting that the price of an asset will fall.\n\nBut it comes at a time when traders are on high alert for more yen intervention from Japanese authorities as they try to prop up its ailing currency.\n\nMarc Ostwald, a global strategist and chief economist at ADM Investor Services, said there was no concrete evidence for the intervention but added that it looked like the broad dollar sell-off \"triggered by stop loss triggers above all in JPY, with a strong suspicion that the MoF [Ministry of Finance] may well have used the opportunity to intervene modestly.\"\n\nStop losses are market orders that trigger if an asset hits a defined price.\n\nMasato Kanda, the vice-minister of finance for international affairs of the Ministry of Finance, told Jiji Press that he was not in a position to comment on any possible intervention. A spokesperson for the ministry wasn't immediately available for comment.\n\nBack in late May, Japan confirmed its first currency intervention since 2022 with a $62 billion spending spree. The ministry stated at the time that Japan had spent 9.7885 trillion yen ($62.25 billion) on currency intervention between April 26 and May 29.\n\nThis timeline coincided with a sharp rebound in the Japanese currency in the weeks prior. The yen had plunged to a 34-year-low of 160.03 against the U.S. dollar on April 29.

So, the three broad criteria I don't think are met.\"\n\nGIUSEPPE SERSALE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ANTHILIA, MILAN\n\n\"The yen is currently making fireworks. Honestly, I couldn't say exactly what's driving it. If the movement persists, it could mean that short-term positioning was too skewed towards short yen. And this US data created a situation where there was a violent rebound and a series of stop losses for those short on yen.\"\n\n\"If, however, the movement deflates, halves during the day, or becomes very erratic, it means there was also a contribution from the Japanese Treasury, who at this moment doesn't admit it... the move however seems excessive since the euro is gaining half a point, the pound is gaining half a point, and so on. Therefore, I have the impression that there is also a bit of contribution from the Japanese.\"\n\nJAMES MALCOLM, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, UBS LONDON:\n\n\"My personal guess is that this is not intervention.\"\n\n\"The thing is the market position is so, so extended that it can feed on itself very, very easily, Regardless of whether you think it should be stabilising, if dollar-yen is dropping and you\u00b4re long, you have to get out... that\u00b4s the definition of a classic carry unwind.\"\n\n\"There is an incentive to perhaps to do a little bit of intervention later in the day to ensure it doesn't rebound.\"\n\nKENNETH BROUX, HEAD OF CORPORATE RESEARCH FX AND RATES, SOCIETE GENERALE\n\n\"It's certainly a big move but I don't think we can say it's anything to do with intervention,\" said Societe Generale's head of corporate research FX and rates Kenneth Broux.\n\n\"The US CPI has been a trigger and it's more about stops being triggered than intervention,\" he said.\n\nSTEVE ENGLANDER, HEAD, GLOBAL G10 FX RESEARCH AND NORTH AMERICA MACRO STRATEGY, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK NY BRANCH, NEW YORK\n\n\"Obviously the yen story has been a rate differential story and positions - long dollar/yen positions - have piled up. So when you get a number that's this definitive in terms of making, say, September highly probable and kind of reinstating the disinflation story, that rate differential story erodes. Most likely it was cleaning up of positions because my sense from clients, especially short-term traders, is that everybody had some long dollar/yen on that they were thinking that maybe 165 or higher was kind of where it was headed.\"\n\n\"There's some vague speculation on intervention, just everybody's looking at the price chart and kind of saying, oh, that's, kind of a sharp drop so maybe could have it been. The answer is it could have, but I'd say most likely its position squaring rather than any official moves.\"\n\nLEE HARDMAN, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, MUFG, LONDON\n\nWhen the market is heavily positioned in one direction and then it goes the other way it can trigger this kind of abrupt move. Dollar/yen long positioning was very stretched\n\nCOLIN ASHER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO, LONDON\n\n\"Most likely, it's just short covering, as speculation of US rate cuts on the horizon build in the wake of the negative CPI print.\"\n\n\"USD/JPY is the G10 pair where positioning is most stretched.\"\n\n\"It's certainly a sizable move, with the intra-day range the biggest since the intervention at the start of May.\"\n\n(Compiled by the Global Finance and Markets Team)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The data is expected to show inflation continued to moderate in June.\n\nDuring a congressional testimony, U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said more good data would strengthen the central bank's confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward its 2 percent target and lead to a potential interest rate cut.\n\nPowell also warned of the risk that leaving interest rates at an elevated level for too long could jeopardize economic growth. He also noted that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\n\nGains across most sectors led by gold miners, financial and technology stocks, also led to the upturn of investor sentiment.\n\nCrude oil prices settled higher after data showed a bigger than expected drop in U.S. crude inventories last week. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for August ended higher by $0.69 at $82.10 a barrel.\n\nIn the Asian trading today, the Australian dollar rose to a 33-year high of 109.38 against the yen and nearly a 6-1/2-month high of 0.6764 against the U.S. dollar, from yesterday's closing quotes of 109.08 and 0.6747, respectively. If the aussie extends its uptrend, it is likely to find resistance around 110.00 against the yen and 0.68 against the greenback.\n\nAgainst the euro and the Canadian dollar, the aussie advanced to 3-day highs of 1.6024 and 0.9215 from Wednesday's closing quotes of 1.6049 and 0.9188, respectively. The aussie may test resistance near 1.59 against the euro and 0.93 against the loonie.\n\nMeanwhile, the safe-have currency or the yen strengthened against other major currencies in the Asian session today.\n\nIn economic news, the value of core machine orders in Japan was down a seasonally adjusted 3.2 percent on month in May, the Cabinet Office said on Thursday - coming in at 857.8 billion yen. That misses forecasts for an increase of 0.9 percent following the 2.9 percent decline in April.\n\nOn a yearly basis, orders jumped 10.8 percent - exceeding expectations for 7.2 percent and up sharply from 0.7 percent in the previous month. For the second quarter of 2024, core machine orders are seen lower by 1.6 percent on quarter and 2.8 percent on year at 2,581.0 billion yen.\n\nIn the Asian trading today, the yen fell to a 32-year low of 175.32 against the euro and a 17-year low of 208.11 against the pound, from early highs of 174.98 and 207.58, respectively. If the yen extends its downtrend, it is likely to find support around 176.00 against the euro and 209.00 against the pound.\n\nAgainst the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, the yen slipped to 161.76 and 179.89 from early highs of 161.47 and 179.62, respectively. On the downside, 164.00 against the greenback and 180.00 against the franc are seen as the next support levels for the yen.\n\nAgainst the New Zealand and the Canadian dollars, the yen edged down to 98.60 and 118.78 from early highs of 98.31 and 118.52, respectively. The yen is likely to find support around 99.00 against the kiwi and 120.00 against the loonie.\n\nLooking ahead, U.K. NIESR monthly GDP tracker data, U.S. inflation data for June, U.S. weekly jobless claims data and U.S. Federal budget balance report for June are slated for release in the New York session.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/images/v4/RTTNews-logo-512x512.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724765", "eventUri": "eng-9724765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Traders reacted sharply, pushing the dollar down as much as 2.1% to 158.3 yen before settling at 158.78 yen, marking a 1.84% drop for the day. The euro also fell about 1.2% to 173.26 yen. Despite fears of an official move by Japanese authorities, experts suggest this was a market-driven reaction. Strategists from Societe Generale and Standard Chartered pointed to the US CPI report and position adjustments as the primary causes. Position squaring and short covering likely fueled the dramatic yen rally.\n\nThe yen's significant movement highlights the sensitivity of currency markets to major economic indicators. Traders had heavily bet on a stronger dollar/yen pairing, but the weak US inflation data forced them to unwind these positions, resulting in sharp currency shifts. This shows that even anticipated data releases can dramatically impact market dynamics and investor strategies.\n\nThe bigger picture: Decoding the ripple effects.\n\nThe large intra-day swing underscores the potential for volatility in global currency markets, especially when key economic data deviates from expectations. The yen's appreciation against various currencies also raised alarms about potential Japanese intervention, a crucial factor for global investors.

The Japanese yen strengthened by over 2%, prompting speculation of Bank of Japan intervention. Analysts suggest the moves are primarily due to market repositioning.\n\nThe dollar dropped on Thursday after data showed headline consumer prices unexpectedly fell in June, with the Japanese yen at one point gaining more than 2% as traders priced in the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. The sharp gain in the yen increased speculation that the Bank of Japan may be intervening to shore up the currency, which fell to a 38-year low against the greenback last week.\n\nBut analysts said the move was most likely related to repositioning, with many traders being caught on the wrong side of the market. 'I'd say most likely it's position squaring rather than any official moves,' said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research and North American macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank NY Branch in New York.\n\nThursday's data showed the consumer price index dipped 0.1% last month after being unchanged in May, and posted an annual gain of 3%, the smallest in a year. Core prices rose by 0.1% in June, for an annual gain of 3.3%.\n\nThe yen has suffered from a wide interest rate differential with the United States and positions betting on further losses in the Japanese currency versus the dollar 'have piled up', Englander said. But today's CPI data indicates that a September rate cut is 'highly probable', and so 'that rate differential story erodes,' he said. Traders are now pricing in a 91% probability of a rate cut in September, up from 75% on Wednesday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

Instead, they're pointing fingers at a soft US consumer inflation reading that triggered dollar selling. The Bank of Japan had previously intervened in 2022 to support the yen, marking its first move since 1998. But this time, the surge seems more about market positions unraveling. Rate differentials are closing in as a US rate cut might come in September. With yen short positions at their highest in nearly three years, the potential for further upward movement is significant.\n\nMarket players are reacting to US CPI data and adjusting their positions, leading to volatility. Bannockburn Global Forex suggests this is normal market behavior rather than intervention. While the intra-day range was the largest since May's intervention, it was mostly due to short covering amidst speculation of US rate cuts.\n\nThe bigger picture: Currency markets react to economic signals.\n\nThe broader narrative is about cleaning up extended positions rather than direct intervention. UBS remarked that this was a 'classic carry unwind' due to the market's long dollar/yen stance. Analysts from Standard Chartered and Societe Generale echo this sentiment, attributing the yen's bullish spike to market mechanisms responding to softer US CPI data and expectations of lower US rates.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chartered", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard Chartered"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9_G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-Kj1bdNcV6lG0xfVi1tXZZ2Xr.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=1ebec0a41f9586d3c1713ead986c0c48", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724765", "eventUri": "eng-9724765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The expectation that they will continue to rise led to a surge in buy orders for financial stocks, such as banks and insurance companies, which are anticipated to see improved earnings.", "source": {"uri": "newsonjapan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On Japan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TOPIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://newsonjapan.com/images/article/142777t.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724765", "eventUri": "eng-9724765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The yen touched its weakest since 1986 just last week, fueling a new wave of jawboning from Japanese authorities about their willingness to act to bolster the currency if necessary.\n\nThat's made market participants nervy about any sudden move in the yen. While the currency dropped more than 3 yen in short order, traders were divided on whether the speedy rally was a result of options trades being closed out, or a sign that Japan was in the market.\n\n\"It's possible, but not likely\" the move was the result of an intervention, said Win Thin, global head of markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. Recent interventions have led to more dramatic moves, he said.\n\nOver the past year, the yen has slumped, making it the worst-performing Group-of-10 currency. Sentiment has been so poor that bearish wagers have dominated the market even after the Bank of Japan raised its short-term policy rate for the first time since 2007 in March.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance bought \u00a59.8 trillion to stem losses in two interventions that appear to have taken place on April 29 and May 1. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki has said he's deeply concerned about the impact of rapid and one-sided currency moves on the economy.\n\n\"The yen dropped dramatically and looks very good timing, but in my opinion just cancellation of JPY short position,\" said Takafumi Onodera, who's in charge of sales and trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp. in New York. \"If it were intervention, it should go to around 156 at least.\"\n\n--With assistance from Issei Hazama and Masaki Kondo.\n\n(Updates to add commentary, context from first paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

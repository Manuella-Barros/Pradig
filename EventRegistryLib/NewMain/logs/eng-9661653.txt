Temperatures climbed fractionally higher than the all-time high of 96F that was recorded in 1957.\n\nAmong the other big cities that have been sweltering are New York, Philadelphia and Washington.\n\nIn Canada, the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec are also under heat warnings, and officials are warning of \"dangerously hot and humid conditions\".\n\nPeople in the affected areas of both countries have been advised to limit outdoor activity and stay hydrated. Extreme heat is the most deadly of all weather conditions, experts say.\n\nIn the western US, California's largest wildfire of the year so far has burned more than 15,000 acres (6,070 hectares) of land since igniting over the weekend.\n\nThe Post Fire, north of Los Angeles, is about 20% contained, according to the Cal Fire website. Hundreds of people have been forced to leave their homes.\n\nWhile large swathes of the US are seeing record highs, it is a very different picture elsewhere.\n\nPreparations have been made for what could be the first tropical storm of the season, Alberto, which could bring large amounts of rain to the Gulf Coast, southern Mexico and parts of Central America.\n\nAnd an NWS winter storm warning remains in place for parts of Montana, where heavy snowfall has been forecast.\n\nEarlier this month, daily records were broken during another heatwave in the Southwest - two weeks before the official start of summer.\n\nTriple-digit readings were logged in Phoenix, among other areas.\n\nHeatwaves have become more frequent and more intense globally since 1950, says the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThat is because of human-caused climate change, which is fuelled by activities like burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests.\n\nHot extremes will happen even more often - and tend to reach higher temperatures - for as long as the world continues to warm, the IPCC says.\n\nEurope is the fastest warming continent on Earth, with temperatures rising at twice the global average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nIn April, Copernicus highlighted how climate change was already taking its toll on the health of Europeans - pointing to increasing numbers of deaths linked to extreme heat over the last 20 years. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [],

And they're among the many extreme weather events, including storms and droughts, that are becoming more common and intense as a result of climate change.\n\nHere's what else the U.S. is seeing -- and bracing for -- this week:\n\nThe first heat wave of the summer struck earlier this week, sending temperatures soaring from the Midwest to New England.\n\nParts of Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont, among others, shattered temperature records, some that stood for more than 100 years.\n\nOn Wednesday, Caribou, Maine -- just south of the Canadian border -- hit a record 103 degrees, nearly 10 degrees warmer than Miami.\n\nMillions of Americans in 15 states were under heat advisories as of late Wednesday. The NWS warned Thursday that heat index readings will peak at 100 to 105 degrees in many locations.\n\nForecasters say record warm overnight temperatures will prevent natural cooling, and are urging everyone -- especially people without air conditioning -- to take steps to stay safe.\n\nThe NWS expects the heat wave to peak in New England and the eastern Great Lakes on Thursday, and in the mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley on Friday.\n\nTemperatures are also predicted to rise in the west on Thursday and Friday before reaching triple digits in California's Central Valley and Great Basin over the weekend.\n\nAs the eastern part of the country was sweating through record high temperatures, a snowy system sent temperatures plunging in the northern Rockies.\n\nParts of Montana and Idaho were under a winter storm warning earlier this week, and nearly one million residents of the West were either under a winter weather or frost advisory on Monday morning.\n\nUSA Today reports that temperatures dipped to 45 degrees in Great Falls, MT., breaking a nearly 130-year-old record.\n\nAreas of higher elevation, including the Showdown ski mountain, were hit with snow. And the cold front continued into Wednesday, the last astronomical day of spring, breaking more records across Montana.\n\nIt's not uncommon for the Rockies to see snow well into June, though AccuWeather notes that it's less common this late in the month.\n\nThe NWS says temperatures across the state \"will warm well above normal this weekend,\" with some areas even poised to approach daily record highs.\n\nSeveral wildfires broke out across New Mexico and California this week, burning thousands of acres and prompting evacuation orders.\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declared a state of emergency early Tuesday for regions impacted by the Salt Fire and South Fork Fire, which alighted the previous day and have since burned more than 23,000 acres -- a combined area larger than the size of Manhattan.\n\nBy Wednesday night, the fires were still zero percent contained. Officials said then that the blazes had damaged some 1,400 structures, including 500 believed to be homes.\n\nAnd they confirmed that two people had been killed, a 60-year-old man found by the side of the road near a motel and another unidentified person in the driver's seat of a burned vehicle -- both in or near Ruidoso, the village between the two fires. Some 8,000 Ruidoso residents remain under evacuation orders.\n\nLujan Grisham called it \"one of the most devastating fires in New Mexico history,\" according to member station KUNM. She said that an additional 200 to 300 firefighters will be deployed to fight the South Fork Fire, the larger of the two, as it approaches higher-density living areas.\n\nThunderstorms on Wednesday night brought flash flooding, mudslides and a massive dust storm known as a haboob to parts of the state. Forecasters say thunderstorms will continue through Friday, though it's unclear how much they will aid in quelling the fires.\n\nCrews are also battling several ongoing wildfires in Northern California, which have forced thousands of residents to evacuate.\n\nThose include two fires that broke out Monday: the Aero Fire in Calaveras County (southwest of Sacramento), which is 52% contained as of Thursday morning and the Sites Fire in Colusa County (north of San Francisco), which is at 15 percent containment.\n\nThey have also made progress in containing the Post Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura County, which has scorched more than 15,000 acres since Saturday and is 47% contained as of Thursday, as well as Sonoma County's Point Fire, which started Sunday and is 60% contained.\n\nMember station KQED reports that climate experts are warning of a busy California wildfire season, especially in September and October when conditions are even drier.\n\nAlberto drenched coastal Texas as it made its way to Mexico on Wednesday, soaking numerous Deep South cities with between 2 and 5 inches of rain. It weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall in Mexico on Thursday morning.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 51 communities to mobilize emergency response resources.\n\nTexas Public Radio\n\nFor example, it said the storm surge flooded the city of Surfside Beach, but that no injuries were reported. The city of Laredo quickly closed their emergency shelters because no one showed up.\n\nIn Mexico, however, Alberto was deadly. Authorities in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n confirmed three deaths associated with the storm: a man died in a river in Monterrey, and two minors died from electric shocks in Allende.\n\nAs the rains and winds associated with Alberto taper off on Thursday, forecasters already have their eyes on the next possible storm brewing in the western Atlantic.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center tweeted that the area of low pressure could become a tropical depression before it reaches the coast of northeast Florida or Georgia on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE

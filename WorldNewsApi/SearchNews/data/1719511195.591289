The deal is pending a physical but the club plans to add him to the roster in time for the start of Sunday\u2019s game. To clear space on the roster, the Red Sox are optioning right-hander Zack Kelly to Triple-A Worcester. Keller was designated for assignment by the Chicago White Sox earlier this week and elected free agency after clearing waivers. The 28-year-old has pitched in parts of seven big league seasons, mostly with the Kansas City Royals, and owns a career 4.28 ERA in 695.2 MLB innings. Though primarily a starting pitcher throughout his career, Keller is expected to pitch out of Boston\u2019s bullpen as a bulk reliever. \u201cHe\u2019s got good stuff, he\u2019s interesting,\u201d manager Alex Cora said Sunday. \u201cWhere we\u2019re at right now using Chase (Anderson) for four innings two days ago and Zack for three innings yesterday we\u2019re short in that aspect, so he\u2019ll give us multiple innings.\u201d The demotion is a tough break for Kelly, who has pitched well in the majors since being called up last month. In 11 games Kelly posted a 2.16 ERA over 16.2 innings, but Cora said given how the roster is currently constructed, they had to make a tough call. \u201cIt\u2019s where we\u2019re at roster wise and tough decisions are going to happen,\u201d Cora said. \u201cTougher decisions are going to come. People are going to get healthy and we\u2019ve got a lot of good pitchers and we can only carry X amount of them.\u201d As for his message to Kelly? \u201cHe threw strikes, he struggled against Tampa but after that he was really good,\u201d Cora said. \u201cThere was no message, this is where we\u2019re at.\u201d O\u2019Neill day to day Tyler O\u2019Neill (knee soreness) wasn\u2019t in the lineup for Sunday\u2019s series finale against Milwaukee, and Cora indicated he\u2019s day-to-day. The plan is for O\u2019Neill to sit Monday in Baltimore before hopefully returning to the lineup on Tuesday, and Cora said he\u2019s confident the outfielder can avoid a trip to the injured list. The knee soreness has helped contribute to O\u2019Neill\u2019s recent struggles at the plate. Since the start of May he\u2019s batted .151 with two home runs and a 43.9% strikeout rate, and over his last four games he\u2019s gone 0 for 15 with 10 strikeouts. Starters announced for Baltimore Cora announced the Red Sox starters for the upcoming series in Baltimore, saying Cooper Criswell will pitch the opener on Monday, Brayan Bello will start Tuesday and Kutter Crawford will pitch the finale on Wednesday. The Orioles came into Sunday second in the AL East at 32-18 and swept the Red Sox in their first meeting at Fenway Park back in April.", "summary": "The Red Sox brought in some bullpen reinforcements on Sunday, signing a veteran right-hander who had hit the free agent marketplace earlier in the week.", "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/26/red-sox-sign-veteran-right-hander-option-zack-kelly-to-triple-a/", "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24139727782264.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:45:05", "author": "Mac Cerullo", "authors": ["Mac Cerullo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.082}

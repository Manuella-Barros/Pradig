Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is running for reelection.\n\nThe 82-year-old progressive firebrand announced Monday that he will seek a fourth six-year term in the U.S. Senate this November. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democratic majority, was first elected to the post in 2006 and has served in Congress for more than three decades.\n\nCiting his seniority in the Senate, the Burlington independent said in a press release Monday that, if he were reelected, he would continue to be \"in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times.\"\n\nIn his announcement, Sanders' campaign noted that he is the longest-serving independent in congressional history. He is also one of the oldest members of the Senate and would be 89 years old at the end of a fourth term.\n\nThough Sanders had given no public indication that he was considering retirement, his plans have been closely watched in Vermont, which lost another senior senator two years earlier with the retirement of veteran Democrat Patrick Leahy. Sanders faces at least one Republican challenger in Gerald Malloy, an Army veteran who ran for the Senate seat opened up by Leahy's departure in 2022.\n\nSanders has been a presence in Vermont politics since he first ran unsuccessfully for statewide office as a member of the Liberty Union Party in the 1970s. He served as mayor of Burlington from 1981 to 1989 and was elected to the U.S. House in 1990.\n\nAfter decades in local, state and congressional politics, Sanders became a household name when he sought the presidency in 2016 and gave former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a run for her money in the Democratic primary. His progressive, populist stances on issues such as health care, income inequality and student loan debt struck a chord with a substantial block of voters. Though he did not secure the presidential nomination in 2016 -- nor in 2020, when he ran again -- Sanders cemented his status as a prominent voice on Capitol Hill.\n\nSince 2023, Sanders has served as chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Sanders is also a part of the U.S. Senate Democratic leadership, and a senior member on the Senate's Budget Committee, Veterans' Affairs Committee and Environment and Public Works Committee.",

If his bid for reelection is successful, Sanders will be 83 years old when his term begins.\n\nHis time in the Senate, along with his previous 16 years in the House of Representatives, makes him the longest-serving independent Member of Congress in American history.\n\n\"Let me thank the people of Vermont, from the bottom of my heart, for giving me the opportunity to serve in the United States Senate,\" Sanders said in a statement to Vermont media on Monday, May 6. \"It has been the honor of my life.\"\n\nThough Sanders is an Independent, he caucuses with the Democratic party. In 2018, the Senator earned his third term with a 67 percent victory over Republican candidate Lawrence Zupan. In 2024, three candidates will challenge Sanders' candidacy - though more may be announced before Vermont's Major Party primary elections are held on August 13.\n\nAnother Independent, Cris Ericson of Chester, announced in 2023 that she will seek election to the Senate - as she has multiple times over the years. In December, Republican Gerald Molloy - who unsuccessfully challenged Senator Peter Welch for his seat in 2022 - announced his candidacy.\n\nDemocrat Jon Svitavsky, a social worker who ran against Sanders in 2018, also shared his intention to run through a Facebook post in September 2023, as well as a GoFundMe campaign the following month.\n\nSanders, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006, is a member of the Democratic Leadership team, the former chair and a senior member of both the Veterans Committee and the Senate Budget Committee, and a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\nIn his statement, Sanders outlined his motivations for seeking another term.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"In recent years, working together, we have made important progress in addressing some very serious challenges,\" he continued. \"But much, much more needs to be done if we are to become the state, and the nation, that our people deserve.\"\n\nHealthcare is one of those challenges and, in his statement, Sanders reiterated his perspective that access to health care is \"a human right, not a privilege.\" While celebrating the high utilization of community health centers in Vermont and his efforts in the senate to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, Sanders said that such measures are \"not enough.\"\n\n\"In my view, the United States must join every other major country on earth in guaranteeing health care to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege,\" he said. \"That's a fight we must continue to wage.\"\n\nCiting the \"devastating flooding\" throughout Vermont in July 2023, Sanders also listed the ongoing impacts of climate change as a reason why he is seeking reelection.\n\nMore from this section Mystik Dan's trainer Kenny McPeek reacts to winning Kentucky Derby and Oaks races Karessa McQueen, Canada's Individual Poetry Slam champion, on creating love out of tragedy Revolutionizing Construction: Sustainable Alternatives to Cement\n\n\"I will tell you that visiting the communities impacted in Barre, in Montpelier, in Weston, Ludlow and other towns, and talking with Vermonters who had lost their homes and businesses - that was a painful experience,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"Together, we must continue to combat climate change by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy,\" he continued. \"I'm proud that I was able to bring $62 million into Vermont to help our people afford solar panels for their rooftops, and additional money for heat pumps. But that's not enough.\"\n\nSanders also highlighted his work with the Veterans Committee and efforts to privatize Veterans Affairs as another motivation, alongside the enduring ramifications of the Supreme Court's repeal of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"We must codify Roe v. Wade into national law and do everything possible to oppose the well-funded right-wing effort to roll back the gains that women have achieved after decades of struggle,\" Sanders said. \"No more second-class citizenship for the women of Vermont or America.\"\n\nThrough the lens of his efforts advocating for the cancellation of student debt, Sanders also alluded to Vermont's own challenges with education funding.\n\n\"In a highly competitive global economy, we need to make sure that all public colleges and universities are tuition free, and that every Vermonter, regardless of income, can get the higher education they need to pursue their dreams,\" he said. \"Further, we need to break our dependence on the regressive property tax in the funding of local schools.\"\n\nDefending Social Security and Medicare was cited as another motivator for Sanders' reelection campaign, alongside a lack of affordable housing in Vermont and beyond.\n\n\"We have a major housing crisis today that must be addressed,\" he said. \"No Vermonter should be paying 40 or 50 percent of his or her income to put a roof over their head.\"\n\nHis final reason for seeking reelection is global, Sanders acknowledged, but \"very much on the minds of Vermonters.\"\n\n\"On October 7th, 2023, Hamas - a terrorist organization - began the war in Gaza with a horrific attack on Israel that killed 1,200 men, women, and children and took more than 230 hostages, some of whom remain in captivity today,\" Sanders said. \"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack, but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.\"\n\nCiting a Palestinian death toll totaling 34,000 - with 77,000 people wounded, including a disproportionate number of women and children -- Sanders also expressed concern for \"now imminent\" famine and starvation.\n\n\"In my view, U.S. tax dollars should not be going to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"These are very difficult times for our country and the world,\" he concluded. \"And, in many ways, this 2024 election is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cherise_forbes@reformer.com", "name": "Cherise Forbes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cris_Ericson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cris Ericson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterans Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Republic_of_Peru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congress of the Republic of Peru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Environment_and_Public_Works", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(AP) -- Eighty-two-year-old liberal U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced Monday that he is running for re-election, saying American democracy is in question during difficult times for the country and the world.\n\nSanders, seeking a fourth Senate term, is an independent. He was a Democratic congressman for 16 years and still caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nIn an announcement video, he said that in many ways the 2024 election \"is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\"\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" he said in his video message. He questioned whether the country will reverse what he called \"the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality\" and if it can create a government that works for all, and a political system not dominated by wealthy campaign contributors.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders said in a review of his positions as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team, as well as a senior member of various other committees.\n\nOn a current controversial topic, Sanders, who has been critical of the war in Gaza, said Israel has the right to defend itself against the Oct. 7, \"horrific\" attack and hostage taking by the terrorist organization Hamas \"but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.\"\n\n\"In my

Bernie Sanders is running for reelection in 2024. The 82-year-old is the last senator to announce his reelection plans this year. His 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns helped ignite the contemporary progressive movement.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the longest-serving independent in American history, will seek a 4th term in the US Senate later this year.\n\nThe 82-year-old Democratic socialist had been coy about his plans for months. He is the last US senator whose term ends in 2024 to announce whether or not he would seek reelection. He is the second-oldest member of the Senate, behind 90-year-old Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.\n\nSanders is immensely popular in Vermont and is all but guaranteed to be reelected in November. Though he is a registered independent, he is likely to have the support of the state Democratic party as well.\n\nHis longshot 2016 presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton helped ignite the modern-day progressive movement, paving the way for figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the \"The Squad\" while helping to steer the Democratic Party in a leftward direction.\n\nSanders ran for president again in 2020, ultimately coming up short to Joe Biden and dropping out of the race weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLong an outside agitator, Sanders has, in recent years, become a kingmaker in progressive politics and an important institutional player in the US Senate.\n\nSince the beginning of Biden's presidency, Sanders has served as the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and later the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nThat's allowed him to make his mark on major party-line legislation while pushing for transformative progressive policies, including a 32-hour workweek and a $17 federal minimum wage.\n\nIn recent months, Sanders -- the Jewish son of a Polish immigrant -- has become the Senate's lead critic of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza, where he's pushed to place conditions on US aid to Israel.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And his announcement comes at a critical moment for Democrats as the party navigates a growing divide over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nSanders has criticized President Joe Biden's handling of the U.S. relationship with Israel even as he's hailed much of Biden's domestic agenda ahead of what could be a tough reelection fight for Biden against GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nSanders said he wants the war in Gaza ended immediately, massive humanitarian aid to follow and no more money sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"We are living in a complicated and difficult political moment,\" Sanders told The Associated Press on Monday. \"I very strongly disagree with Biden in terms of the war in Gaza.\"\n\nAt home, he said, the presidential election is between Biden and Trump, \"and Donald Trump is in my view the most dangerous president, has been the most dangerous president in American history.\"\n\nWith the prospect of Trump's possible return to the White House, Sanders framed his bid to return to the Senate as being driven by concerns about the future of democracy in the U.S. In an announcement video, he said that in many ways the 2024 election \"is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\"\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" he said. He questioned whether the country will reverse what he called \"the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality\" and if it can create a government that works for all, and not continue with a political system dominated by wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nKnown for his liberal politics and crusty demeanor, Sanders has been famously consistent over his 40 years in politics, championing better health care paid for by the government, higher taxes for the wealthy, less military intervention and major solutions for climate change. He has also spent his career trying to hold corporate executives to account, something that he's had more power to do as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nSanders is an independent. He was a Democratic congressman for 16 years and still caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nHe sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. He said a year ago that he would forgo another presidential bid and endorse Biden's reelection this year.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders said in a review of his positions as chairman of the important Senate panel and a member of the chamber's Democratic leadership team, as well as a senior member of various other committees.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed from Washington.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [],

If his bid for re-election is successful, Senator Sanders will be 83 years old when his term begins.\n\nHis time in the Senate, along with his previous 16 years in the House of Representatives, makes him the longest-serving independent Member of Congress in American history.\n\n\"Let me thank the people of Vermont, from the bottom of my heart, for giving me the opportunity to serve in the United States Senate,\" Sanders said in a statement to Vermont media on Monday, May 6. \"It has been the honor of my life.\"\n\nThough Sanders is an Independent, he caucuses with the Democratic party. In 2018, the Senator earned his third term with a 67% victory over Republican candidate Lawrence Zupan. In 2024, three candidates will challenge Sanders' candidacy - though more may be announced before Vermont's Major Party primary elections are held on August 13.\n\nAnother Independent, Cris Ericson of Chester, announced in 2023 that she will seek election to the Senate - as she has multiple times over the years. In December, Republican Gerald Molloy - who unsuccessfully challenged Senator Peter Welch for his seat in 2022 - announced his candidacy.\n\nDemocrat Jon Svitavsky, a social worker who ran against Sanders in 2018, also shared his intention to run through a Facebook post in September 2023, as well as a GoFundMe campaign the following month.\n\nSanders, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006, is a member of the Democratic Leadership team, the former chair and a senior member of both the Veterans Committee and the Senate Budget Committee, and a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\nIn his statement, Sanders outlined his motivations for seeking another term.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"In recent years, working together, we have made important progress in addressing some very serious challenges,\" he continued. \"But much, much more needs to be done if we are to become the state, and the nation, that our people deserve.\"\n\nHealthcare is one of those challenges and, in his statement, Sanders reiterated his perspective that access to health care is \"a human right, not a privilege.\" While celebrating the high utilization of community health centers in Vermont and his efforts in the senate to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, Sanders said that such measures are \"not enough.\"\n\n\"In my view, the United States must join every other major country on earth in guaranteeing health care to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege,\" he said. \"That's a fight we must continue to wage.\"\n\nCiting the \"devastating flooding\" throughout Vermont in July 2023, Sanders also listed the ongoing impacts of climate change as a reason why he is seeking re-election.\n\nMore from this section Amateur Archaeologists Found Five Mysterious Skeletons at a Nazi Base Mostly dry today with lots of cloud cover; change comes midweek for Connecticut Striped, not spotted: Missing zebra on the lam in western US\n\n\"I will tell you that visiting the communities impacted in Barre, in Montpelier, in Weston, Ludlow and other towns, and talking with Vermonters who had lost their homes and businesses - that was a painful experience,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"Together, we must continue to combat climate change by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy,\" he continued. \"I'm proud that I was able to bring $62 million into Vermont to help our people afford solar panels for their rooftops, and additional money for heat pumps. But that's not enough.\"\n\nSanders also highlighted his work with the Veterans Committee and efforts to privatize Veterans Affairs as another motivation, alongside the enduring ramifications of the Supreme Court's repeal of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"We must codify Roe v. Wade into national law and do everything possible to oppose the well-funded right-wing effort to roll back the gains that women have achieved after decades of struggle,\" Sanders said. \"No more second-class citizenship for the women of Vermont or America.\"\n\nThrough the lens of his efforts advocating for the cancellation of student debt, Sanders also alluded to Vermont's own challenges with education funding.\n\n\"In a highly competitive global economy, we need to make sure that all public colleges and universities are tuition free, and that every Vermonter, regardless of income, can get the higher education they need to pursue their dreams,\" he said. \"Further, we need to break our dependence on the regressive property tax in the funding of local schools.\"\n\nDefending Social Security and Medicare was cited as another motivator for Sanders' re-election campaign, alongside a lack of affordable housing in Vermont and beyond.\n\n\"We have a major housing crisis today that must be addressed,\" he said. \"No Vermonter should be paying 40 or 50 percent of his or her income to put a roof over their head.\"\n\nHis final reason for seeking re-election is global, Sanders acknowledged, but \"very much on the minds of Vermonters.\"\n\n\"On October 7th, 2023, Hamas - a terrorist organization - began the war in Gaza with a horrific attack on Israel that killed 1,200 men, women, and children and took more than 230 hostages, some of whom remain in captivity today,\" Sanders said. \"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack, but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.\"\n\nCiting a Palestinian death toll totaling 34,000 - with 77,000 people wounded, including a disproportionate number of women and children -- Sanders also expressed concern for \"now imminent\" famine and starvation.\n\n\"In my view, U.S. tax dollars should not be going to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"These are very difficult times for our country and the world,\" he concluded. \"And, in many ways, this 2024 election is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cherise_forbes@reformer.com", "name": "Cherise Forbes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cris_Ericson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cris Ericson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterans Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Republic_of_Peru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congress of the Republic of Peru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Environment_and_Public_Works", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced Monday he will run for reelection this year, squelching speculation that the 82-year-old progressive icon might retire at a time when the Democratic Party is anxious about the advancing age of its top leaders.\n\nHailing from a Democratic stronghold, Sanders' decision virtually guarantees that he will return to Washington for a fourth Senate term. And his announcement comes at a critical moment for Democrats as the party navigates a growing divide over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nSanders has criticized President Joe Biden's handling of the U.S. relationship with Israel even as he's hailed much of Biden's domestic agenda ahead of what could be a tough reelection fight for Biden against GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nSanders said he wants the war in Gaza ended immediately, massive humanitarian aid to follow and no more money sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"We are living in a complicated and difficult political moment,\" Sanders told The Associated Press on Monday. \"I very strongly disagree with Biden in terms of the war in Gaza.\"\n\nAt home, he said, the presidential election is between Biden and Trump, \"and Donald Trump is in my view the most dangerous president, has been the most dangerous president in American history.\"\n\nWith the prospect of Trump's possible return to the White House, Sanders framed his bid to return to the Senate as being driven by concerns about the future of democracy in the U.S. In an announcement video, he said that in many ways the 2024 election \"is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\"\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" he said. He questioned whether the country will reverse what he called \"the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality\" and if it can create a government that works for all, and not continue with a political system dominated by wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nKnown for his liberal politics and crusty demeanor, Sanders has been famously consistent over his 40 years in politics, championing better health care paid for by the government, higher taxes for the wealthy, less military intervention and major solutions for climate change. He has also spent his career trying to hold corporate executives to account, something that he's had more power to do as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nSanders is an independent. He was a Democratic congressman for 16 years and still caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nHe sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. He said a year ago that he would forgo another presidential bid and endorse Biden's reelection this year.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders said in a review of his positions as chairman of the important Senate panel and a member of the chamber's Democratic leadership team, as well as a senior member of various other committees.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Senators serve for six-year terms, and Sanders would be 89 years old when his next senate term ends. President Joe Biden's age, 81, has become a flashpoint in his reelection campaign.\n\nSanders has emerged as a leading voice of the progressive left.

And let me take a few minutes to tell you why.\"\n\nIn his signature clipped New York accent, Sanders did so.\n\nRelated: Minority Rule review: rich history of America's undemocratic democracy\n\nCiting his roles as chair of the Senate health, labor and pensions committee, part of Senate Democratic leadership and as a member of committees on veterans affairs, the budget and the environment, Sanders said: \"I have been and will be if re-elected in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times.\"\n\nShould Sanders win re-election and serve a full term, he will be 89 years old at the end of those six years. In a decidedly gerontocratic Senate, that would still be younger than the current oldest senator, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who will turn 91 in September. The Republican is due for re-election in 2028 - and has filed to run.\n\nSanders was a mayor and sat in the US House for 16 years before entering the Senate in 2007.\n\nIn 2016 he surged to worldwide prominence by mounting an unexpectedly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, from the populist left. He ran strongly again in 2020 but lost out to Joe Biden.\n\nAnnouncing another election run, he stressed the need to improve public healthcare, including by defending social security and Medicare and lowering prescription drug prices; to combat climate change that has seen Vermont hit by severe flooding; to properly care for veterans; and to protect abortion and reproductive rights.\n\n\"We must codify Roe v Wade [which protected federal abortion rights until 2022] into national law and do everything possible to oppose the well-funded rightwing effort to roll back the gains that women have achieved after decades of struggle,\" Sanders said. \"No more second-class citizenship for the women of Vermont. Or America.\"\n\nAddressing an issue which threatens to split Democrats in the year of a presidential election, Sanders said: \"On 7 October 2023, Hamas, a terrorist organisation, began the war in Gaza with a horrific attack on Israel that killed 1,200 innocent men, women and children and took more than 230 hostages, some of whom remain in captivity today. Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack.\"\n\nBut Sanders, who is Jewish, also said Israel \"did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which was exactly what it is doing: 34,000 Palestinians have already been killed and 77,000 have been wounded, 70% of whom are women and children. According to humanitarian organisations, famine and starvation are now imminent.\n\n\"In my view, US tax dollars should not be going to the extremist [Benjamin] Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nIn conclusion, if without mentioning Donald Trump by name, Sanders called the 2024 election \"the most consequential election in our lifetimes\".\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy? Or will we move to an authoritarian form of government? Will we reverse the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality that now exists? Or will we continue to see billionaires get richer while working families struggle to put food on the table? Can we create a government that works for all of us?

He said a year ago that he would forgo another presidential bid and endorse Joe Biden's reelection this year.

And let me take a few minutes to tell you why.\"\n\nIn his signature clipped New York accent, Sanders did so.\n\nRelated: Minority Rule review: rich history of America's undemocratic democracy\n\nCiting his roles as chair of the Senate health, labor and pensions committee, part of Senate Democratic leadership and as a member of committees on veterans affairs, the budget and the environment, Sanders said: \"I have been and will be if re-elected in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times.\"\n\nShould Sanders win re-election and serve a full term, he will be 89 years old at the end of those six years. In a decidedly gerontocratic Senate, that would still be younger than the current oldest senator, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who will turn 91 in September. The Republican is due for re-election in 2028 - and has filed to run.\n\nSanders was a mayor and sat in the US House for 16 years before entering the Senate in 2007.\n\nIn 2016 he surged to worldwide prominence by mounting an unexpectedly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, from the populist left. He ran strongly again in 2020 but lost out to Joe Biden.\n\nAnnouncing another election run, he stressed the need to improve public healthcare, including by defending social security and Medicare and lowering prescription drug prices; to combat climate change that has seen Vermont hit by severe flooding; to properly care for veterans; and to protect abortion and reproductive rights.\n\n\"We must codify Roe v Wade [which protected federal abortion rights until 2022] into national law and do everything possible to oppose the well-funded rightwing effort to roll back the gains that women have achieved after decades of struggle,\" Sanders said. \"No more second-class citizenship for the women of Vermont. Or America.\"\n\nAddressing an issue which threatens to split Democrats in the year of a presidential election, Sanders said: \"On 7 October 2023, Hamas, a terrorist organisation, began the war in Gaza with a horrific attack on Israel that killed 1,200 innocent men, women and children and took more than 230 hostages, some of whom remain in captivity today. Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack.\"\n\nBut Sanders, who is Jewish, also said Israel \"did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which was exactly what it is doing: 34,000 Palestinians have already been killed and 77,000 have been wounded, 70% of whom are women and children. According to humanitarian organisations, famine and starvation are now imminent.\n\n\"In my view, US tax dollars should not be going to the extremist [Benjamin] Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nIn conclusion, if without mentioning Donald Trump by name, Sanders called the 2024 election \"the most consequential election in our lifetimes\".\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy? Or will we move to an authoritarian form of government? Will we reverse the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality that now exists?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on Monday that he will seek a fourth term this fall, ending months of speculation over his political future.\n\nIn a lengthy statement to local media, Sanders, 82, said he is in a \"strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times.\" Last year, Sanders ascended to the chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where he has broad authority over many of the issues he's focused on during his four-decade political career.\n\n\"In recent years, working together, we have made progress in addressing some very important challenges,\" he wrote. \"But much, much more needs to be done if we are to become the state, and the nation, that our people deserve.\"\n\nFirst elected to Congress in 1990, Sanders spent 16 years in the House before running for a Senate seat vacated by Republican-turned-independent Jim Jeffords. Sanders easily won his last campaign in 2018, receiving 67 percent of the vote to Republican challenger Lawrence Zupan's 25 percent. Sanders is now the longest serving independent member of Congress in history, according to his office.\n\nSanders decision to run again comes as the age of political candidates is top of mind for many voters as questions linger over President Joe Biden's fitness for office. Sanders, who is a year older than Biden, would be 89 by the end of his next term.\n\nSome of Sanders' allies have been quietly urging him to run for reelection, viewing him as a still-vital force in the broader progressive movement, the Washington Post recently reported. But in typical fashion, Sanders has been deflecting questions about his political future in interviews, saying voters would rather hear him talk about issues.\n\nIn his statement Monday, Sanders highlighted his work to expand health care access, lower the cost of prescription drugs and push for student debt relief, among other issues. He has also reiterated his criticism of Israel's war against Hamas. Sanders has been an outspoken critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the high civilian death toll in Gaza.\n\n\"In my view, U.S. taxpayers should not be providing billions more to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people,\" Sanders wrote.\n\nSanders, who has a war chest of nearly $10 million, has only one declared challenger in the race, Republican Gerald Malloy. A U.S. army veteran, Malloy ran for Senate in 2022 against Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.).

He originally served 16 years as a congressman in the House of Representatives, before being elected to his first six-year term in the Senate in 2006, and he was reelected in 2012 and 2018.\n\nAlthough one of a handful of independents in the Senate, he has notoriously caucused with Democrats on the House and Senate side for most of his career. He chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and is part of other committees, and with his seniority he is commonly viewed as being among Senate Democratic leadership.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders said in an announcement on Monday. \"In recent years, working together, we have made important progress in addressing some very serious challenges. But much, much more needs to be done if we are to become the state and the nation our people deserve.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Sanders' office and campaign via email for further comments.\n\nThe senator also said that the November election \"is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\"\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" he said.\n\nUpon his announcement and seemingly expressing no desire to leave Washington, D.C., some individuals online were wary due to Sanders being 83 years of age if reelected and 89 years old at the completion of a hypothetical fourth Senate term.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders will turn 83 years old in September,\" Democrat Matt Murphy posted on X. \"That means he would be 89 years old at the end of his term. Absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I resent that so many from this generation continue clinging on to power,\" said Democrat Zack Czajkowski on X. \"He'll be 89 at the end of his next term. Great.\"\n\n\"Bernie Sanders is running for re-election at 82 years old. By the end of his next term, he'll be 89 years old. Why don't these people want to live out their last days with their families rather than try and destroy our nation?\" wrote conservative Joey Mannarino on X.\n\nOne X user noted the difference in how Sanders and President Joe Biden are perceived based on their ages.\n\nSanders is older than Biden and, if reelected to another term, would finish off that term older than Biden would be at the end of his second hypothetical term as president if successful against Donald Trump.\n\n\"I hate it here,\" said X user @Needle_of_Arya. \"Where's the parallel universe where Hillary is in her second term?\"\n\n\"We need a new generation,\" said Joel Cardwell. \"Boomers are so last century. With respect, sir.\"\n\nIn his announcement, Sanders also touched on the escalating situation in Gaza between Israel and Hamas as pro-Palestinian protests continue across the United States.\n\nSanders has been among the most vocal Senate critics of continuing to provide military aid to Israel, citing famine and the increasing loss of life among Palestinians.\n\n\"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself [after Hamas' October 7, 2023, attacks] against this terrorist attack, but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people -- which is what it's

But in recent years, he's become the leading progressive voice in the Senate, often working with Mr. Biden to push shared priorities and wielding serious influence in the chamber.\n\nIn recent months, Sanders has been an outspoken critic of the Israeli government, sometimes breaking with Democratic leaders in the process. In his reelection video announcement on Monday, he reiterated that while \"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself\" against the Oct. 7 attack, \"it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/01/17/c95a1ee0-e62e-4ffb-a053-d7e858d560ca/thumbnail/1200x630/557fc6062d23f1f750ba9b848c1bf6f8/gettyimages-1807991797-1.jpg?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543151", "eventUri": "eng-9543151", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2165, "textEnd": 2171}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Bernie Sanders of Vermont has officially announced his intention to seek reelection, putting to rest any speculation about his retirement. At 82, the progressive stalwart's decision to run for a fourth Senate term comes at a pivotal time for the Democratic Party, which is currently grappling with internal divisions over the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Sanders, known for his critical stance on President Joe Biden's approach to the US-Israel relationship, nonetheless praises much of Biden's domestic policies. His reelection bid is framed against the backdrop of potential competition from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, highlighting Sanders' concern for the future of US democracy.\n\nSanders' announcement underscores the significance of the 2024 election, questioning whether the US will maintain its democratic integrity or shift towards authoritarianism. He also addresses the pressing issue of income and wealth inequality in the country, advocating for a government that serves all citizens rather than being influenced by wealthy campaign contributors. As an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, Sanders has been a vocal figure in US politics, previously seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. Despite deciding against another presidential run and endorsing Biden's reelection, Sanders continues to leverage his influential role in the Senate.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labour and Pensions Committee since 2022, Sanders has been at the forefront of pushing for healthcare reforms, including efforts to reduce prescription drug costs. His position allows him to champion the needs of Vermonters and advocate for policies that align with his long-standing priorities. With a distinguished career as a Democratic congressman for 16 years before his tenure in the Senate, Sanders remains a key figure in shaping the legislative agenda and addressing the challenges facing Americans today.\n\nIn light of his reelection bid, Sanders' commitment to addressing critical issues such as healthcare affordability and income inequality reaffirms his dedication to creating a more equitable society. His continued influence in the Senate underscores the importance of experienced leadership in navigating complex political landscapes and ensuring that government actions reflect the needs and interests of all citizens.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sathish_raman@oneindia.com", "name": "Sathish Raman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.oneindia.com/img/2024/05/bernie-sanders-82-seeks-fourth-senate-term-ft.jpg?07052024002032", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543151", "eventUri": "eng-9543151", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introducing legislation for a 32-hour workweek on 'Special Report.'\n\nSaying that \"today I am announcing my intention to seek another term\" in the Senate, longtime independent Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday formally launched his bid for re-election.\n\nThe 82-year-old progressive champion who caucuses with the Democrats is running for a fourth six-year term representing the blue state of Vermont in the Senate.\n\nSanders, the runner-up for the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential nominations, is the chair of the Senate's top health care committee, a senior member on both the Budget and Veterans committees, and is part of the Democrats' leadership team in the chamber.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders touted in an on-camera announcement posted on social media.\n\nFIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS\n\nSanders emphasized that \"in recent years, working together, we have made important progress in addressing some very serious challenges. But much, much more needs to be done if we are to become the state and the nation our people deserve.\"\n\nThe senator, who has long worked to push the Democratic Party to the left, pushed for trillions in spending during the first two years of President Biden's administration, as the nation rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic. But his efforts to pass legislation expanding Medicare and weakening the filibuster were unsuccessful.\n\nBut Sanders has also worked to seek compromise with more moderate members of the Democratic conference and at times with the GOP minority.\n\nWhile a Biden ally, Sanders has been a vocal critic of the White House and Democrats in recent months over their push to provide aid to Israel as it battles Hamas in the war in Gaza.\n\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN BUSHES OFF SANDERS TAKE ON COLLEGE CAMPUS PROTESTS\n\nSanders acknowledged that \"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself from this terrorist attack,\" as he pointed to the bloody October attack by Hamas that left of 1,200 Israelis dead.\n\n\"But it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people,\" he added, as he pointed to the Israeli war in Gaza that has reportedly left over 34,000 Palestinians dead. \"U.S. tax dollars should not be going to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nSanders, a former Socialist mayor of Burlington, Vermont's largest city, later served in the House of Representatives before winning election to the Senate in 2006.\n\nHe was narrowly edged by Hillary Clinton in a marathon and divisive 2016 Democratic presidential primary battle, and was the last candidate standing against Biden in the race for the 2020 nomination.\n\nDemocrats currently control the U.S. Senate with a 51-49 majority, but Republicans are looking at a favorable Senate map this year, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs.\n\n6 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN NOVEMBER\n\nThree of those seats are in red states that former President Trump carried in 2020 - Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election. And five more are in key general election battleground states.\n\nDemocrats are also defending an open seat in blue Maryland, where popular former two-term Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is running for the Senate.\n\nWith Sanders running for re-election, Vermont's seat is not considered in play and he's expected to easily win another term.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican Gerald Malloy, who lost the 2022 election in Vermont, is running again.\n\nFraming his re-election effort, Sanders highlighted what's at stake.\n\n\"There are very difficult times for our country and in world. And, in many ways, this 2024 election is the most consequential election in our lifetimes. Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" the senator asked.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government? Will we reverse the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality that now exists, or will we continue to see billionaires get richer while working families struggle to put food on the table? Can we create a government that works for all of us, or will our political system continue to be dominated by wealthy campaign contributors? These are just some of the questions that together we need to answer.\"\n\nSanders, 82, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006 after 16 years as Vermont's sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is the longest-serving independent member of Congress in United States history.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, N.Y., Sanders graduated from James Madison High School and attended Brooklyn College and the University of Chicago before settling in Vermont. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vt., in 1981, a position he held for eight years, serving four terms. While serving as Burlington's mayor, he unsuccessfuly ran for governor of Vermont in 1986, hosted a public access show, \"Bernie Speaks with the Community,\" and recorded a folk and spoken word album, \"We Shall Overcome.\" Terry Bouricius, who served as the president of Burlington's city council and was an ally to Sanders, said that he \"changed the entire nature of politics in Burlington and also in the state of Vermont\" when he was mayor.\n\nIn 1988, Sanders unsuccessfully ran for Vermont's at-large congressional district in the House against Republican Peter Smith, the state's lieutenant governor, after then-Rep. Jim Jeffords vacated the seat to run for U.S. Senate. Two years later, as an independent, he defeated Smith and Democratic candidate Dolores Sandoval to win the seat. Sixteen years later, when Sanders won his first race for Senate, it was Jeffords, a Republican-turned-independent, that he replaced; no Republican held either seat after Sanders' victory.\n\nSanders was one of the co-founders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a powerful group of progressives in the House, in 1991, and chaired the Senate's Veterans Affairs, Budget and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committees.\n\nHe emerged as a prominent figure on the national stage in 2016 when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination against Hillary Clinton, bolstered by a grassroots movement of donors and a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Though he is a registered independent, he is likely to have the support of the state Democratic party as well.\n\nHis longshot 2016 presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton helped ignite the modern-day progressive movement, paving the way for figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the \"The Squad\" while helping to steer the Democratic Party in a leftward direction.\n\nSanders ran for president again in 2020, ultimately coming up short to Joe Biden and dropping out of the race weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLong an outside agitator, Sanders has, in recent years, become a kingmaker in progressive politics and an important institutional player in the US Senate.\n\nSince the beginning of Biden's presidency, Sanders has served as the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and later the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nThat's allowed him to make his mark on major party-line legislation while pushing for transformative progressive policies, including a 32-hour workweek and a $17 federal minimum wage.\n\nIn recent months, Sanders -- the Jewish son of a Polish immigrant -- has become the Senate's lead critic of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza, where he's pushed to place conditions on US

In the video, Sanders said serving in the Senate thus far \"has been the honor of my life.\"\n\n\"I have been and will be, if reelected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" he said at the beginning of the eight-minute-long clip, which emphasized that his senior committee assignments in the Senate give him a powerful voice for his constituents.\n\nNoting that his primary goal -- accessible healthcare -- has seen progress in the past years, he said there is more for him to do, claiming that Vermont leads the nation in community health care centers, \"but that is not enough.\"\n\n\"In my view, the United States must join every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing health care to all of our people as a human right -- not a privilege and not a fight,\" said Sanders, one of three independents in the upper chamber.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Prevents Fight in Senate Hearing After GOP Senator Tells Teamster Boss, 'Get Your Butt Up'\n\nSanders, a third-term senator who previously served eight terms in the House of Representatives, listed lowering the cost of prescription drugs, inhalers and insulin as some of the major changes he has helped make. He said this time around, he wants to target the bigger drug companies.\n\n\"We need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and end the absurdity of Americans paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\" he proclaimed.\n\nHis next goal is to combat the climate crisis. Reflecting on the mass flooding across the state of Vermont last year, Sanders said he brought $62 million to the state to facilitate solar panel installment and more heat pumps.\n\n\"We must work with every country on Earth to cut carbon emissions and save the planet for our kids and future generations,\" he continued.\n\nHe will also focus on combating those who want to privatize veterans facilities, promoting accessible housing and protecting women's rights -- including \"codify[ing] Roe v. Wade into national law\" -- as well as ensuring free tuition to public universities and upholding social security and medicare benefits.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Endorses Joe Biden's Reelection Campaign, Ruling Out 2024 Run of His Own\n\nThe final point Sanders touched on was the Israel-Gaza war. He reflected on Oct. 7, when 1,200 Israelis were killed in an attack by Hamas, and shared his opinion on U.S. tax dollars helping to fund Israel's offensives in Gaza, which have reportedly killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\n\"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack,\" he began. \"But it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\nTo conclude, Sanders, who has endorsed Democratic incumbent Joe Biden for president, emphasized the national importance of the November 2024 election.\n\n\"These are very difficult times for our country and the world, and in many ways, this 2024 election is the most consequential election in our lifetimes,\" he said. \"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy? Or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insulin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

In an announcement video, he said that in many ways the 2024 election \"is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAlso Read | Russia Warns Britain, Plans Nuclear Drills Over West's Possible Deepening Role in Ukraine Amid Rising Tensions.\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" he said. He questioned whether the country will reverse what he called \"the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality\" and if it can create a government that works for all, and not a political system not dominated by wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nSanders is an independent. He was a Democratic congressman for 16 years and still caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nHe sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. He said a year ago that he would forgo another presidential bid and endorse Biden's reelection this year.\n\nSanders became the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labour and Pensions Committee in 2022, a position he had long sought and has enabled him to tout some of his top priorities, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs and other health services.\n\n\"I have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" Sanders said in a review of his positions as chairman of that panel and a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team, as well as a senior member of various other committees.

things.\n\nSanders also outlined in a video statement posted to X one of the key differences between himself and President Joe Biden's current administration: U.S. support for Israel's brutal military campaign in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack -- but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing,\" Sanders said. \"U.S. tax dollars should not be going to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nAfter a nearly two-decade run in the House prior to his time in the Senate, Sanders is already the longest serving congressional independent in U.S. history.", "source": {"uri":

In both primaries, he finished in second to the Democratic nominee. He is considered the de-facto leader of progressives in the Senate.\n\nIn an eight-minute campaign launch speech posted online Monday, Sanders called to suspend U.S. military aid to Israel during the war. He has been among the most prominent critics of Israel's conduct in its war against Hamas in Gaza, although he has also drawn criticism from some on the left for not condemning Israel more harshly.\n\n\"On Oct. 7th, 2023, Hamas - a terrorist organization - began the war in Gaza with a horrific attack on Israel that killed 1,200 men, women, and children and took more than 230 hostages, some of whom remain in captivity today,\" Sanders said in the video. \"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack, but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.\"\n\nSanders, who spent months in his youth on an Israeli kibbutz, has framed his criticism of Israel around the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"According to humanitarian organizations, famine and starvation are now imminent,\" Sanders said. \"In my view, U.S. tax dollars should not be going to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nAlso on Monday, in a separate post, Sanders expressed alarm at Israeli plans to invade Rafah, the last major redoubt of Hamas in Gaza, where more than a million Palestinians have sought refuge.\n\n\"For months, the U.S. has warned against an attack,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Netanyahu ignored the warnings. Now an assault is imminent. It will kill countless civilians. President Biden must back his words with action. End all offensive military aid to Israel.\"\n\nSanders' announcement video is otherwise focused on the services he says he has provided his state, including expanded health care and flood relief, although he touches on national issues including reproductive rights. He concluded the video by saying, like other Democrats, that this year's election is a test for democracy, an allusion to the prospects that former President Donald Trump could return to office. He also said more needs to be done on causes that he has championed, including wealth inequality and campaign finance.\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" Sanders says. \"Will we reverse the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality that now exists, or will we continue to see billionaires get richer while working families struggle to put food on the table? Can we create a government that works for all of us, or will our political system continue to be dominated by wealthy campaign contributors?\"\n\nSanders did not mention his age in the video.\n\nThe other Vermont senator, Democrat Peter Welch, has also taken a lead in criticism of Israel's war conduct, as has the state's sole member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Becca Balint, a Jewish Democrat.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_kampeas@jta.org", "name": "Ron Kampeas", "type":

Bernie Sanders Announces Bid for Fourth Term", "body": "At age 82, the Vermont independent, who caucuses with Democrats, says his seniority puts him in a position to help Vermonters 'in these difficult times.'\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on May 6 that he is running for re-election.\n\nIn a video just over eight minutes long, Mr. Sanders, 82, who caucuses with the Democrats, remarked that, given his seniority on committees, he would be \"in a strong position to provide the kind of help the Vermonters need in these difficult times.\"\n\nMr. Sanders served in the House of Representatives between 1991 and 2007. He has been in the Senate since 2007.\n\nHe was chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee between 2013 and 2015 and the Senate Budget Committee between 2021 and 2023. He currently chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nBefore entering Congress, he was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont. A self-described democratic socialist, he has been a member of many socialist organizations.\n\nIn the video, Mr. Sanders, who will be 89 at the end of what would be his fourth Senate term, called for lowering prescription drug costs, lowering the cost of insulin, combating climate change, giving quality health care to veterans, protecting abortion rights, codifying the landmark Supreme Court abortion case Roe v. Wade, enacting free college tuition, protecting and expanding Social Security and Medicare, and creating affordable housing.\n\nPresident Joe Biden held a White House meeting this past week to highlight his administration's continued fight against Big Pharma and efforts to lower prescription drug costs. Mr. Sanders joined President Biden to highlight his efforts to cut healthcare costs -- particularly his recent steps to lower the cost of inhalers.\n\nPresident Biden criticized drug companies for charging \"exorbitant prescription drug prices.\"\n\nHe also said the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering drug costs for seniors on Medicare.\n\n\"Americans are sick and tired of paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\" he said.\n\n\"On average, we pay over three times as much as the people of other major countries for brand-name prescription drugs, and in some cases, we are paying 10 or 20 times more than people around the world for the exact same product,\" he added.\n\nIn the announcement video, Mr. Sanders said that while Israel has the right to defend itself against the terrorist group Hamas, the Jewish state \"does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people.\"\n\nHe said the United States should cease funding for Israel while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in office.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Sanders called the 2024 election \"the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\n\n\"Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\" he said.\n\nHe questioned whether the country will reverse what he called \"the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality\" and if it can create a government that works for all, and a political system not dominated by wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nMr. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for president as a Democrat in 2016 and 2020. Each time, he ended up endorsing the Democrat nominees, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and then President Biden.\n\nPresident Trump is leading by 2 to 8 percentage points in six states -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina -- on a sample ballot with third-party and independent candidates.

She is a rising senior majoring in Journalism at Pepperdine, where she is the editor-in-chief of the school's magazine.\n\nBernie Sanders is running for another term in the U.S. Senate, which would keep him in office until the age of 89 if elected.\n\nIn a video posted to X on Monday, the 82-year-old Vermont senator announced that he will be seeking reelection in November as his current term comes to an end. In the video, Sanders said serving in the Senate thus far \"has been the honor of my life.\"\n\n\"I have been and will be, if reelected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\" he said at the beginning of the eight-minute-long clip, which emphasized that his senior committee assignments in the Senate give him a powerful voice for his constituents.\n\nNoting that his primary goal -- accessible healthcare -- has seen progress in the past years, he said there is more for him to do, claiming that Vermont leads the nation in community health care centers, \"but that is not enough.\"\n\n\"In my view, the United States must join every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing health care to all of our people as a human right -- not a privilege and not a fight,\" said Sanders, one of three independents in the upper chamber.\n\nSanders, a third-term senator who previously served eight terms in the House of Representatives, listed lowering the cost of prescription drugs, inhalers and insulin as some of the major changes he has helped make. He said this time around, he wants to target the bigger drug companies.\n\n\"We need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and end the absurdity of Americans paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\" he proclaimed.\n\nHis next goal is to combat the climate crisis. Reflecting on the mass flooding across the state of Vermont last year, Sanders said he brought $62 million to the state to facilitate solar panel installment and more heat pumps.\n\n\"We must work with every country on Earth to cut carbon emissions and save the planet for our kids and future generations,\" he continued.\n\nHe will also focus on combating those who want to privatize veterans facilities, promoting accessible housing and protecting women's rights -- including \"codify[ing] Roe v. Wade into national law\" -- as well as ensuring free tuition to public universities and upholding social security and medicare benefits.\n\nThe final point Sanders touched on was the Israel-Gaza war.

He ruled out a third run for president a year ago but left political watchers waiting until weeks before the May 30 filing deadline to announce his reelection plans.\n\nThe Vermont independent promised to address the same issues that have defined his decadeslong political career in a video announcing his decision: universal healthcare, climate change, and challenging corporate \"greed.\"\n\nBut he also cited his growing seniority in pitching himself to voters. Sanders became the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions at the start of the new Congress and is a member of Democratic leadership.\n\n\"In recent years, working together, we have made important progress in addressing some very serious challenges. But much, much more needs to be done if we are to become the state and the nation our people deserve,\" he said in the video, posted to X on Monday.\n\nSanders, who caucuses with the Democrats, has not faced a serious challenge in his reelection bids.

That assault seven months ago resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\n\"Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack, but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing,\" Sanders said in his announcement.\n\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Monday that at least 34,735 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory, including at least 52 deaths in the past 24 hours.\n\nA wave of pro-Palestinian protests on US university campuses has been the latest front in a fierce worldwide debate as anger over civilian deaths has triggered complaints that demonstrations have sometimes veered into hate against Jews.\n\nSanders, who suffered a heart attack during his 2020 presidential campaign, is the second-oldest senator, behind 90-year-old Republican Chuck Grassley.\n\nHe is almost certain to be reelected by his liberal northeastern state, meaning he would be 89 at the end of an upcoming term.\n\nA fringe figure for much of his career, Sanders saw his political stock rise as he campaigned twice to represent the Democrats in presidential elections on a platform of universal health care, fairer housing and low-priced universities.\n\nHis run in the

These are just some of the questions that together we need to answer and that I look forward to discussing with you on the campaign trail.\"\n\nSanders is best known for injecting progressive ideas into the bloodstream of America, such as Medicare for All and a minimum wage increase, through his presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020. Though he was unsuccessful in securing the Democratic nomination both times, he managed to pull Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, the party's nominees in the cycles he ran, left.\n\nThroughout his career, he also maneuvered his way into more power, from mayor of Burlington, to member of the House of Representatives, to the Senate. Today, he is chair of the powerful Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a position that has given him concrete institutional power.\n\nHis allies had expressed a strong desire for him to run for reelection. In an interview ahead of his announcement, former Ohio state Senator Nina Turner, a former Sanders presidential campaign co-chair, noted how few high-profile progressives have the broad recognition that Sanders does.\n\n\"[If he runs it means] he still feels like there's more to do in his elected capacity and that he does understand ... that he is still very much needed in that elected space, especially in the Senate,\" Turner said. \"Certainly we have a lot more progressive types in the House of Representatives but we have very few progressives in the United States Senate, and so yeah we need him on that wall and he knows it.\"\n\nSanders's announcement ends speculation about whether he would seek a fourth term, a decision that drew fast praise from progressives.\n\n\"It is absolutely critical that we have his voice in the Senate, and I'm really grateful that I'm going to have more time to serve alongside him on all the issues that he and I both care deeply about,\" said Representative Becca Balint, a Democrat from Vermont, who told the Globe she spoke with Sanders this morning. \"I'm thrilled he's running again.\"\n\nSanders is expected to cruise into reelection; he currently has no serious challengers.\n\n\"I don't think he'll run in the next race after this one, so that gives us six years to pull together a strategy, find a good candidate and challenge whoever steps up,\" said Joshua Bechhoefer, the Republican county chair for Addison County, Vermont.\n\nHis status as a curmudgeon in some ways made him an unlikely political icon. But his anger at the status quo has often resonated with supporters frustrated with a political system that they felt had left them with few good choices.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-payer healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nina Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Health,_Education,_Labor_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becca_Balint", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Becca Balint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_County,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addison County, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Addison County, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/qo26oKf3-uPbth2oJLZyMXlSDrk=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/2BBZE54HDJKJKJ4A5UV6PSCGOE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543151", "eventUri": "eng-9543151", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

establishment pulled together in a coordinated effort to support Biden.\n\nft/mlm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It doesn't come as any great shock that Sanders is looking to remain on the Government payroll, of course, since outside of some odd jobs here and there Bernie Sanders (who styles himself a Democratic Socialist because of his strong affinity for and understanding of the working man and his needs) has never drawn a paycheck for non-government related work. Some might consider hanging up their hat after 43 years continuously in elected office but there will it seems be no passing of the torch by Senator Sanders, who would be 88 at the end of the term should he win reelection.\n\nYes, but the question there is to which home should he go?\n\nBernie, it should be remembered, has done very well for himself for a man who's subsisted on a public salary for his entire adult life... not that there's anything suspicious there at all.\n\nNow now, Democratic Socialism isn't the same thing as 'Communism' for reasons... ill defined reasons that change based on what the argument is that's being made, but reasons nonetheless.\n\nYeah, no, there will be no consistency to be had on this issue. Democrats are great at holding two ideas in their head at the same time but not by the usual method of making them work together, they just pretend one or the other thing isn't something they believe when it's inconvenient because 'this is different' or something.\n\nThe question of course is if the people of Vermont will see fit to reelect Sanders, but Vermont is somewhat notorious for having insane politics and only sending the most liberal candidates to Washington of late so he'll probably win handily.

He likely also wasn't expecting his former teammate Shedeur Sanders to call him \"very mid at best\".\n\n\"He was destroying guys' confidence and belief in themselves,\" Smith said about Deion Sanders. \"The way he did it, it could've been done with a little more compassion.\"\n\nRelated: Deion Sanders Finally Addresses Recent Controversial Social Media Antics\n\nWhile Shedeur Sanders faced a ton of backlash for the jab at Smith, fellow Buffs began to dive into what was a messy situation on social media.\n\nOne that Deion Sanders felt could have been prevented altogether by the story not being written. Sanders addressed the article in an exclusive interview with a group of content creators, and revealed that he felt Smith was \"used\".\n\n\"This is what's strange to me,\" Sanders told the group via Thee Pregame Show. That great weekend with the (spring) game. with the festivities, great recruiting weekend, million recruits up there that can flat-out, play and change the complexity of your program. And right after that, somebody goes and finds a young brother. They talk about another brother and. Is that okay? How's that okay? You go and find somebody that bad mouths us that ain't been with us. Why aren't you talking about the team you're with or the team you're getting ready to go to?\n\n\"And how can this gentleman not know that you're being used? Because now you're going to get used again. Now the fans getting ready to jump on you, and you ain't built like that mentally and emotionally. You're not prepared for that onslaught. So you got to be careful with that. And, that's the sad thing about it. You're not you're not built for that kind of stuff, man. Like, don't don't do that.\"\n\nSanders also denounced the claims that Smith and others made about any kind of mistreatment taking place with the former players.\n\n\"No one mistreats nobody, man. Like, we don't do that,\" said Sanders. \"I don't condone that. Y'all been around me. Y'all know how I get down. I don't mistreat anybody. I don't play that, I don't condone that.\"\n\nSanders urged players from the previous regime to enter their names into the transfer portal to allow him to bring in more transfers or what he referred to as \"Louis\" luggage. In total, Colorado saw around 60 players exit the program via the portal before 2023, while over 50 joined.\n\nRelated: Charles Barkley Has One Wish For LeBron James' Retirement\n\nSanders and his roster full of transfers, which saw another 41 leave and 37 join this offseason, are looking to contend in the Big 12 in 2024. They dramatically improved the roster from where it once was, but whether or not a contender can be built through the portal remains a mystery.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_borba@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kevin Borba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Peay_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin Peay State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_El_Paso", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at El Paso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/73/9732ffb7-5af5-5975-9f7c-e53eed5626c0/663931e27e41f.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543151", "eventUri": "eng-9543151", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Bernie Sanders called on the Biden administration to stop the looming attack that humanitarian and rights organizations have been warning against for months.\n\nThe Vermont independent senator said President Joe Biden must follow through on his call for Israel to protect civilian lives by forgoing a ground invasion of Rafah. In March Biden said the attack would be a \"red line\" unless Israel developed a credible plan to evacuate civilians, who include an estimated 600,000 children in the city.\n\nTo stop Israel from killing potentially hundreds of thousands of people in the city, where 1.4 million people are sheltering following Israel's obliteration of cities across Gaza, the U.S. must \"end all offensive military aid\" to the country, Sanders said Monday.\n\n\"Now an assault is imminent,\" said Sanders. \"It will kill countless civilians. President Biden must back his words with action.\"\n\nThe senator made his latest demand for an end to Israel's U.S.-backed assault on Gaza hours after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initiated a forced evacuation of about 100,000 people in eastern Rafah, dropping leaflets that ordered displaced families to move to a strip of land along Gaza's coast. An estimated 600,000 children are among the city's current population.\n\nIsrael has killed scores of people in Rafah in recent weeks with airstrikes on residential areas. Last week, dozens of U.S. House Democrats called on Biden to ensure a full-scale ground assault would not go forward, days before Israeli officials briefed the U.S. -- the world's largest funder of the IDF -- about its plan to forcibly expel people from the city.\n\nLate last month Biden signed a foreign aid package that included $17 billion for Israel's military -- legislation that Sanders voted against.\n\nSanders reiterated his demand for Biden to end his support for the IDF as he announced his 2024 reelection campaign.\n\nAlong with the climate crisis, healthcare and prescription drug costs, and protecting U.S. democracy, said Sanders, Israel's assault on Gaza is \"very much on the minds of Vermonters,\" whom he has represented in the Senate since 2007.\n\nWhile Israel had the right to defend itself against Hamas for its October 7 attack, said Sanders, \"it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which is exactly what it is doing.\"\n\n\"Thirty-four thousand Palestinians have already been killed and 77,000 have been wounded -- 70% of whom are women and children,\" he added. \"According to humanitarian organizations, famine and starvation are now imminent. In my view, U.S. tax dollars should not be going to the extremist Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nTop Israeli officials including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir have pushed back against a potential cease-fire deal in recent days, with Smotrich saying last week that Israel must see to the \"total annihilation\" of cities in Gaza, including Rafah.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The head coach and NFL legend appeared to pile on with shade at another player, and also got into it with a fan.\n\n\"Ion even remember him tbh. Bro had to be very mid at best,\" Shedeur Sanders posted in response to quotes from former Colorado player Xavier Smith.\n\nWhen a teammate at Austin Peay of Smith stepped in to defend the FCS All-American, a screenshot of his stats was posted to which Deion Sanders replied \"Lawd Jesus.\" The two words have since been seen by over 20 million people on the app formerly known as Twitter, with many interpreting them as Sanders piling onto the player.\n\nRelated: Deion Sanders Wants Fans To Focus On Another Story Amid Social Media Beefs\n\nSomething that he denied in an exclusive interview with a group of content creators, including the X user @Dalvinthetruth, who uploaded the player's stats.\n\n\"Y'all know what Lord Jesus means,\" Sanders said to the group via The Pregame Show. \"That means dang you (Dalvin) really went at this cat and they took it as I was shooting at the kid. I don't play shooting at no kid. I was saying, dang, Dalvin ain't playing y'all, better leave him alone. That's really what I was like, Lord Jesus. And I think that was taken wrong. I think that was taken sideways.\"\n\nWhile he clearly felt remorse for how his comment was taken, Sanders also addressed his response to a fan as well. This one, he didn't feel sorry for. After someone commented \"Tell yo son stop act like he the coldest out here then put up a 4-8 season\" Sanders replied, \"He will be a top 5 pick. Where yo son going ? Lololol I got time today. Lololol\". A statement that he stood by during the media session with the creators.\n\n\"But the other gentleman that came at Shedeur. Now, I came back,\" said Sanders. \"Now that that that was me. Just like. All right. Now my baby going top five. What what about you? Like that was real. So I got to do better on that and not ride with it. But I was bored and I didn't say anything hurtful. I don't attack people. But every once in a while I want to play, you know, and then I get petty. I know I could handle that kind of stuff. I can handle that. That's been happening my whole life. A lot of people can't handle that.\"\n\nSanders also expressed some frustration and confusion with the article, expressing that it put Smith in a position to be attacked by fans but did deny the claims made by Smith and other players featured in the story.\n\n\"No one mistreats nobody, man. Like, we don't do that. I don't condone that. Y'all been around me. Y'all know how I get down. I don't mistreat anybody. I don't play that, I don't condone that.\"\n\nSanders infamously told the players from the 2022 Colorado team that went 1-11 under Karl Dorrell to hit the portal and assured them he was bringing in their replacements.\n\n\"We got a few positions already taken care of because I'm bringing my own luggage with me,\" Sanders told the team in a meeting with players released on social media. \"And it's Louis, OK?\"\n\nRelated: Fans Disturbed By Latest Awkward Question WNBA Star Caitlin Clark Was Asked By Reporter\n\nOver 50 players left the team before the 2023 season with over 50 transfers joining the program.

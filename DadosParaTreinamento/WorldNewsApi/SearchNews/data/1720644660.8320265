{"id": 231244374, "title": "Why the Fire should move on from Xherdan Shaqiri now", "text": "In the 61st minute of the Fire\u2019s victory last Saturday against the Galaxy, Brian Gutierrez intercepted a pass a few feet past midfield. Gutierrez rushed down the middle of the field and shot from about 25 yards, ricocheting his attempt off both goalposts before the ball crossed the line for perhaps the Fire\u2019s best goal of the season. It\u2019s not a coincidence this happened without Xherdan Shaqiri. For the Fire, there\u2019s no reason to give their most expensive player another second on the field in their colors. Shaqiri was allowed to leave for the Swiss national team\u2019s training camp in preparation for Euro 2024 before the Fire\u2019s May 25 match against D.C. United. The camp began May 27, meaning Shaqiri could have suited up for the Fire before departing. Since that decision, the Fire have five points in three matches. That\u2019s not a torrid pace, but it\u2019s a steep improvement from most of their season. \u201cAt the point where we are at the moment as a group, we needed and I needed everyone to be focusing on one thing, and it\u2019s just normal,\u201d coach Frank Klopas said after the D.C. United game. \u201cIt\u2019s from a human standpoint, that the guy could be thinking with the Euros, it could be the last one [of his career]. It\u2019s best that we made that decision, and we wish him the best.\u201d Because Shaqiri\u2019s contract is up at the end of the season, the Fire should make sure that statement doubles as a farewell even after Shaqiri\u2019s national team commitments end. The upcoming transfer window gives them an opportunity \u2014 perhaps long overdue \u2014 to move on, whether it\u2019s a shift to Swiss sister club FC Lugano or elsewhere. If a transfer doesn\u2019t materialize, the outcome should be the same: Shaqiri\u2019s last game with the Fire already has been played. In 2\u00bd seasons, Shaqiri never has lived up to his salary or transfer fee forked over by sporting director Georg Heitz. He has scored 14 goals and added 18 assists in 69 MLS matches, far from what should be expected of a designated player orchestrating an attack. Beyond his underwhelming statistics, there have been intermittent questions about Shaqiri\u2019s effort and commitment to the Fire compared to the Swiss national team. Shaqiri\u2019s presence also hasn\u2019t helped Gutierrez, whose game seemed to stagnate this season. Instead of playing centrally where his creativity can shine, Gutierrez has been punted out to a wing since Shaqiri arrived before the 2022 season. It\u2019s hard to say how much that has stunted Gutierrez\u2019s growth, but it probably hasn\u2019t helped. If Shaqiri is moved, the Fire can see what they have in Gutierrez, a much faster and younger player who\u2019s more likely to be on the club\u2019s next contender. A permanent move to the so-called No. 10 position would be another development in Gutierrez\u2019s roller-coaster season. \u201cI\u2019ve had ups and downs, the team also had ups and downs, but right now I feel more confident on the ball and my play is developing even more as I\u2019m playing,\u201d Gutierrez said after the Galaxy game. \u201cEvery player has ups and downs, but you always have to look forward and see the future.\u201d Gutierrez needs to be a central part of the Fire\u2019s immediate and long-term future. Shaqiri should only be part of their past.", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/fire/2024/06/08/why-the-fire-should-move-on-from-xherdan-shaqiri-now", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0f85bc8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1169+0+98/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F57%2F3e%2Fdf2629c34532a686d3ace418fd14%2F20240", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:26:59", "author": "Brian Sandalow", "authors": ["Brian Sandalow"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.015}

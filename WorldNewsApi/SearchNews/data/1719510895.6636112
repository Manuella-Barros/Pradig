During his remote appearance at the Viva Technology conference in Paris on Thursday, Musk was asked whether he was concerned about losing his job to AI, and what he would do if that were to happen. Musk holds several roles as the CEO of Tesla, and founder of xAI, SpaceX and Neuralink, as well as the owner of social media platform X. \u201cIn a benign scenario, probably none of us will have a job,\u201d Musk replied. \u201cThere will be universal high income \u2014 and not universal basic income \u2014 universal high income. There\u2019ll be no shortage of goods or services.\u201d The tech mogul said that in his opinion, there is an 80% chance that AI advances will result in such a situation where humans will not need a job and will have all they need. \u201cThe question will really be one of meaning, of how \u2014 if a computer can do, and the robots can do everything better than you \u2026 does your life have meaning?\u201d Musk said. \u201cThat really will be the question in that benign scenario, and in the negative scenario, all bets are off where we\u2019re in deep trouble.\u201d Musk has predicted before that AI will eventually become so advanced it will eliminate the need for humans to work. \u201cI think we are seeing the most disruptive force in history here,\u201d Musk said of AI during a sit-down with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the inaugural AI Safety Summit in London last fall. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed,\u201d the tech billionaire said. \u201cYou can have a job if you want to have a job \u2014 sort of personal satisfaction \u2014 but the AI will be able to do everything.\u201d", "summary": "\"The question will really be one of meaning, of how \u2014 if a computer can do, and the robots can do everything better than you \u2026 does your life have meaning?\" Musk said.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/business/elon-musk-expects-ai-will-replace-all-human-jobs-lead-to-universal-high-income/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/us-businessman-elon-musk-addresses-82508800.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:41", "author": "Fox Business", "authors": ["Fox Business"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.223}

These submarines play a crucial role in Russia's maritime strategy in the region, offering stealth capabilities and potent offensive options.\n\nThe sinking of the \"Rostov-on-Don\" represents a significant blow to the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

Great work, warriors.\"\n\nRussia has occupied Crimea since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine more than two years ago, it has come under sporadic attack from Kyiv's forces.\n\nThe Russian-appointed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said submarine defense exercises were taking place on Saturday, and \"everything is calm in the city.\"\n\nOn a post on Saturday, Russian military blogger Boris Rozhin said the ship repair plant in Sevastopol, where the submarine was docked, appears to have been hit.\n\nCommissioned in 2014, the Rostov-on-Don is a 73.8-meter (242-foot) Kilo II-class submarine and carries a crew of 52. With a submerged displacement of 3,100 tons, the diesel-electric-powered vessel can carry Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nTaking out Russian assets armed with Kalibr missiles is an important part of Kyiv's military strategy because Russia has used Kalibr and missiles like it to attack vital Ukrainian infrastructure such as power plants, said Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst.\n\n\"Hitting this submarine is a big, big deal,\" Leighton said.\n\nUkraine has targeted the Rostov-on-Don before.\n\nThe submarine was \"severely damaged\" in a Ukrainian missile attack in September 2023, according to Ukraine's General Staff. After that attack, open-source intelligence photos, including ones cited by Britain's defense ministry, showed what the ministry said was \"catastrophic damage.\"\n\nBut Ukraine's General Staff said the Rostov-on-Don was repaired and recently tested in the waters of Sevastopol harbor.\n\nKyiv's forces have enjoyed sustained successes targeting Russia's Black Sea Fleet, with either missile strikes or sea drone attacks.\n\nMore than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own, technological innovation, audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea.\n\nRussia's worst naval loss of the war was the sinking of the guided-missile cruiser Moskva in April 2022.\n\nIn October last year, satellite imagery indicated that Russia relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks.\n\nIn addition to striking the submarine, Ukrainian forces also severely damaged four S-400 anti-aircraft missile launchers on Friday, the Ukrainian General Staff said.\n\nLeighton said destruction of the anti-aircraft batteries could help open up the skies over Crimea for Ukrainian warplanes to take on more Russian targets on the occupied peninsula.",

Great work, warriors.\"\n\nRussia has occupied Crimea since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine more than two years ago, it has come under sporadic attack from Kyiv's forces.\n\nThe Russian-appointed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said submarine defense exercises were taking place on Saturday, and \"everything is calm in the city.\"\n\nOn a post on Saturday, Russian military blogger Boris Rozhin said the ship repair plant in Sevastopol, where the submarine was docked, appears to have been hit.\n\nCommissioned in 2014, the Rostov-on-Don is a 73.8-meter (242-foot) Kilo II-class submarine and carries a crew of 52. With a submerged displacement of 3,100 tons, the diesel-electric-powered vessel can carry Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nTaking out Russian assets armed with Kalibr missiles is an important part of Kyiv's military strategy because Russia has used Kalibr and missiles like it to attack vital Ukrainian infrastructure such as power plants, said Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst.\n\n\"Hitting this submarine is a big, big deal,\" Leighton said.\n\nUkraine has targeted the Rostov-on-Don before.\n\nThe submarine was \"severely damaged\" in a Ukrainian missile attack in September 2023, according to Ukraine's General Staff. After that attack, open-source intelligence photos, including ones cited by Britain's defense ministry, showed what the ministry said was \"catastrophic damage.\"\n\nBut Ukraine's General Staff said the Rostov-on-Don was repaired and recently tested in the waters of Sevastopol harbor.\n\nKyiv's forces have enjoyed sustained successes targeting Russia's Black Sea Fleet, with either missile strikes or sea drone attacks.\n\nMore than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own, technological innovation, audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea.\n\nRussia's worst naval loss of the war was the sinking of the guided-missile cruiser Moskva in April 2022.\n\nIn October last year, satellite imagery indicated that Russia relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks.\n\nIn addition to striking the submarine, Ukrainian forces also severely damaged four S-400 anti-aircraft missile launchers on Friday, the Ukrainian General Staff said.\n\nLeighton said destruction of the anti-aircraft batteries could help open up the skies over Crimea for Ukrainian warplanes to take on more Russian targets on the occupied peninsula.",

Great work, warriors.\"\n\nRussia has occupied Crimea since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine more than two years ago, it has come under sporadic attack from Kyiv's forces.\n\nThe Russian-appointed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said submarine defense exercises were taking place on Saturday, and \"everything is calm in the city.\"\n\nOn a post on Saturday, Russian military blogger Boris Rozhin said the ship repair plant in Sevastopol, where the submarine was docked, appears to have been hit.\n\nCommissioned in 2014, the Rostov-on-Don is a 73.8-meter (242-foot) Kilo II-class submarine and carries a crew of 52. With a submerged displacement of 3,100 tons, the diesel-electric-powered vessel can carry Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nTaking out Russian assets armed with Kalibr missiles is an important part of Kyiv's military strategy because Russia has used Kalibr and missiles like it to attack vital Ukrainian infrastructure such as power plants, said Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst.\n\n\"Hitting this submarine is a big, big deal,\" Leighton said.\n\nUkraine has targeted the Rostov-on-Don before.\n\nThe submarine was \"severely damaged\" in a Ukrainian missile attack in September 2023, according to Ukraine's General Staff. After that attack, open-source intelligence photos, including ones cited by Britain's defense ministry, showed what the ministry said was \"catastrophic damage.\"\n\nBut Ukraine's General Staff said the Rostov-on-Don was repaired and recently tested in the waters of Sevastopol harbor.\n\nKyiv's forces have enjoyed sustained successes targeting Russia's Black Sea Fleet, with either missile strikes or sea drone attacks.\n\nMore than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own, technological innovation, audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea.\n\nRussia's worst naval loss of the war was the sinking of the guided-missile cruiser Moskva in April 2022.\n\nIn October last year, satellite imagery indicated that Russia relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks.\n\nIn addition to striking the submarine, Ukrainian forces also severely damaged four S-400 anti-aircraft missile launchers on Friday, the Ukrainian General Staff said.\n\nLeighton said destruction of the anti-aircraft batteries could help open up the skies over Crimea for Ukrainian warplanes to take on more Russian targets on the occupied peninsula.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The Kilo-class submarine Rostov-on-Don was hit in Sevastopol, Ukraine's military said. Ukraine has relentlessly targeted Russia's Black Sea Fleet since the war began.\n\nUkraine says it struck and sank a Russian Black Sea Fleet submarine and damaged a number of prized S-400 air defense systems in Crimea.\n\nIn a statement on Telegram, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said the Kilo-class submarine Rostov-on-Don was hit in the port of Sevastopol.\n\n\"The boat sank on the spot,\" the General Staff said.\n\n\"The destruction of the Rostov-on-Don proves once again that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,\" it added.\n\nBusiness Insider was unable to independently verify the claim. The Russian Defense Ministry has not yet commented.\n\nThe Russian-appointed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, posted on Telegram on Sunday morning but did not reference Ukraine's announcement.\n\n\"Everything is quiet in the city,\" he wrote, while also warning of an upcoming training exercise.\n\nUkraine's military said the B-237 Rostov-on-Don \"is one of four Kilo-class submarines capable of using 'Kalibr' missiles.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that sub, which Ukraine says cost Russia $300 million, has been targeted in the conflict.\n\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in September that the submarine had \"likely suffered catastrophic damage\" following a missile strike on a shipyard in Sevastopol.\n\n\"Any effort to return the submarine to service is likely to take many years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" the MoD said at the time.\n\nDespite having no traditional navy of its own, Ukraine has had huge success battling the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nMany of the fleet's ships have been forced to relocate eastward from the naval base in Sevastopol to Novorossiysk, and it has also lost a number of key warships, including its flagship, the Moskva.\n\nIn addition to striking the submarine, the General Staff said Ukrainian forces had also severely damaged four S-400 antiaircraft missile launchers.\n\nFrederik Mertens, a former strategic analyst at the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, previously told BI that by targeting Crimea and defense systems such as the S-400, Ukraine was likely \"preparing the ground\" for the use of F-16 fighter jets, which arrived in Ukraine earlier this week.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said in a separate statement that the launchers were \"significantly damaged\" on Friday.\n\nUkraine previously zeroed in on the Rostov-on-Don, a Kilo-class submarine launched back in 2014, in September 2023. A missile attack on a shipyard in Sevastopol struck the vessel and a Russian landing ship while they were being repaired in dry docks.\n\n\"The Rostov has likely suffered catastrophic damage,\" the British government said at the time, saying repairs to the submarine could take years.\n\nThere was \"significant damage\" to the submarine before it was repaired and tested in Sevastopol, Kyiv said on Saturday.\n\n\"As a result of the hit, the boat sank on the spot,\" Ukraine's armed forces said.

Newsweek has approached Moscow's Defense Ministry for comment via email.\n\nSince Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has used missiles and drones to target the Black Sea Fleet, partially based in Sevastopol.

Moscow has moved many of its vessels toward its Novorossiysk base, and is thought to be establishing another Black Sea base in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia.\n\nVice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, the head of Ukraine's navy, told Reuters last month that Moscow was \"losing\" Sevastopol, adding, \"Almost all the main combat-ready ships have been moved by the enemy from the main base of the Black Sea Fleet.\"\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said in late July that 26 Russian vessels were damaged or destroyed in the Black Sea between February 2022 and June 2024. Ukraine's navy has estimated that more than a third of the fleet has been taken out.\n\nThe Rostov-on-Don is the only known Russian submarine to have been damaged in the Black Sea since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has one of the largest and most advanced submarine fleets in the world, and those vessels are considered far more formidable than its surface fleets.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

Russia said Ukrainian drones also hit an apartment building, killing one person.\n\nThe uptick in attacks since July comes as Ukraine mounts pressure on allies to allow it to use long-range missiles to strike targets in Russia. Western allies, in particular the US, have so far resisted, fearing escalation from Moscow.\n\nAlso Read | Israel 'Terror' Stabbing: 2 Killed, 2 Injured in Stabbing Spree in Holon, Palestinian Attacker Neutralised.\n\nUkraine struck a Russian Kilo-class submarine and an S-400 anti aircraft missile complex in the Moscow-occupied Crimean peninsula, according to a statement from the General Staff on Saturday. The air defense system was established to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge, an important logistics and transport hub supplying Russian forces.\n\nUnits of the missile forces, as well as the Navy, damaged four launchers of the Triumph air defence system, while in the port of Sevastopol, the \"Rostov-on-Don\" - a submarine of Russia's Black Sea fleet - was attacked and sank, the statement said.\n\nAlso Read | Wayanad Landslide Tragedy: Chinese Premier Li Qiang Sends Condolence Message to PM Narendra Modi on Kerala Landslides, Says 'Shocked To Learn About Catastrophe That Caused Heavy Casualties'.\n\nThe General Staff also confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region after launching a massive drone barrage on Russia. Hits were recorded in warehouses with ammunition, where guided aerial bombs were stored. The operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Defence Ministry, the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgorod Gov Vyacheslav Gladkov said that a woman was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on an apartment building in the town of Shebekino early Sunday. Ukrainian drones also damaged several other buildings in the town, he said.\n\nGladkov said eight civilians have been wounded in the region by Ukrainian shelling and dozens of drone strikes since the previous day.\n\nIn the span of a month, Russia has experienced a surge in the tempo of Ukrainian drone barrages and long-range attacks, targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields and oil depots. Analysts say such an intensification is needed if Ukraine is to degrade Russian capabilities.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n- Ukraine's human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he has appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations to investigate a photo that allegedly shows the body of a Ukrainian prisoner of war tortured and executed by Russian forces. He has also asked Ukrainian authorities to verify the identity of the deceased.\n\nThe photo, circulating on social media, shows the body of a person without a head or limbs. The Associated Press was unable to verify it.\n\n\"This is not just a violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, this is the behaviour of monsters,\" Lubinets said in a statement on Telegram.\n\n\"We are aware of recent reports online and in the media. We take these reports extremely seriously. The way we work is to respond via relevant authorities directly and confidentially,\" Pat Griffiths, ICRC Spokesperson in Ukraine, told the Associated Press on Sunday when asked about Lubinet's request.\n\n\"Speaking generally, the law of armed conflict is clear. Prisoners of war must be treated humanely at all times,\" he added.

Russia said Ukrainian drones also hit an apartment building, killing one person.\n\nThe uptick in attacks since July come as Ukraine mounts pressure on allies to allow it to use long-range missiles to strike targets in Russia. Western allies, in particular the U.S., have so far resisted, fearing escalation from Moscow.\n\nUkraine struck a Russian Kilo-class submarine and an S-400 anti aircraft missile complex in the Moscow-occupied Crimean peninsula, according to a statement from the General Staff on Saturday. The air defense system was established to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge, an important logistics and transport hub supplying Russian forces.\n\nUnits of the missile forces, as well as the Navy damaged four launchers of the Triumph air defense system, while in the port of Sevastopol, the \"Rostov-on-Don\" -- a submarine of Russia's Black Sea fleet -- was attacked and sank, the statement said.\n\nThe General Staff also confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region after launching a massive drone barrage on Russia. Hits were recorded in warehouses with ammunition, where guided aerial bombs were stored. The operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Defense Ministry, the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said that a woman was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on an apartment building in the town of Shebekino early Sunday. Ukrainian drones also damaged several other buildings in the town, he said.\n\nGladkov said eight civilians have been wounded in the region by Ukrainian shelling and dozens of drone strikes since the previous day.\n\nIn the span of a month, Russia has experienced a surge in the tempo of Ukrainian drone barrages and long-range attacks, targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields and oil depots. Analysts say such an intensification is needed if Ukraine is to degrade Russian capabilities.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

ministry also celebrated the achievement on X, commending its \"warriors\" for sinking the submarine.\n\n\"The Black Sea fish will enjoy [its] new home,\" it wrote.\n\nRussia's Kilo-class submarine has been a major concern for Kyiv as it can launch Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nIt was believed to have played a major role in massive missile attacks on Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nAs a result, the submarine has been a persistent target for Ukrainian forces, one being severely damaged in a strike on September 13, 2023.\n\nMoscow was reportedly able to repair the submarine and move it deeper into a port to avoid further attacks.\n\nBut Ukraine's persistent attacks apparently paid off, causing Russia to lose an approximately $300-million underwater asset.\n\nUkraine's long-range strikes on Russia have intensified after Kyiv's Western allies have allowed it greater freedom to use their donated weapons.\n\nA recent attack on Russian-occupied Crimea reportedly damaged an enemy S-400 air

Russia said Ukrainian drones also hit an apartment building, killing one person.\n\nThe uptick in attacks since July come as Ukraine mounts pressure on allies to allow it to use long-range missiles to strike targets in Russia. Western allies, in particular the US, have so far resisted, fearing escalation from Moscow.\n\nUkraine struck a Russian Kilo-class submarine and an S-400 anti aircraft missile complex in the Moscow-occupied Crimean peninsula, according to a statement from the General Staff on Saturday. The air defence system was established to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge, an important logistics and transport hub supplying Russian forces.\n\nUnits of the missile forces, as well as the Navy damaged four launchers of the Triumph air defence system, while in the port of Sevastopol, the \u201cRostov-on-Don\u201d \u2013 a submarine of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet \u2013 was attacked and sank, the statement said.\n\nThe General Staff also confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region after launching a massive drone barrage on Russia. Hits were recorded in warehouses with ammunition, where guided aerial bombs were stored. The operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence, and the Defence Ministry, the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that a woman was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on an apartment building in the town of Shebekino early on Sunday. Ukrainian drones also damaged several other buildings in the town, he said.\n\nGladkov said eight civilians have been wounded in the region by Ukrainian shelling and dozens of drone strikes since the previous day.\n\nIn the span of a month, Russia has experienced a surge in the tempo of Ukrainian drone barrages and long-range attacks, targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields and oil depots. Analysts say such an intensification is needed if Ukraine is to degrade Russian capabilities.In other developments\n\nUkraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he has appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations to investigate a photo that allegedly shows the body of a Ukrainian prisoner of war tortured and executed by Russian forces. He has also asked Ukrainian authorities to verify the identify of the deceased.\n\nThe photo, circulating on social media, shows the body of a person without a head or limbs. Journalists were unable to verify it.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, this is the behaviour of monsters,\u201d Lubinets

Western allies, in particular the US, have so far resisted, fearing escalation from Moscow.\n\nUkraine struck a Russian Kilo-class submarine and an S-400 anti-aircraft missile complex in the Moscow-occupied Crimean peninsula, according to a statement from the General Staff on Saturday.\n\nThe air defence system was established to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge, an important logistics and transport hub supplying Russian forces.\n\nUnits of the missile forces as well as the navy damaged four launchers of the Triumph air defence system, while in the port of Sevastopol, the Rostov-on-Don - a submarine of Russia's Black Sea fleet - was attacked and sank, the statement said.\n\nThe General Staff also confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region after launching a massive drone barrage on Russia. Hits were recorded in warehouses with ammunition, where guided aerial bombs were stored.\n\nThe operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Defence Ministry, the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a woman was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on an apartment building in the town of Shebekino early on Sunday. Ukrainian drones also damaged several other buildings in the town, he said.\n\nMr Gladkov said eight civilians have been wounded in the region by Ukrainian shelling and dozens of drone strikes since Saturday.\n\nIn the span of a month, Russia has experienced a surge in the tempo of Ukrainian drone barrages and long-range attacks, targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields and oil depots. Analysts say such an intensification is needed if Ukraine is to degrade Russian capabilities.", "source": {"uri": "dailyecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Southern Daily Echo"}, "authors": [],

After that attack, open-source intelligence photographs, including those cited by Britain's defense ministry, showed what the ministry said was \"catastrophic damage,\" reports Tch.", "source": {"uri": "kosovapress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kosovapress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalibr_(missile_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalibr (missile family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staff (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Sub_Sea_Tours", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Sub Sea Tours", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://kosovapress.com/admin/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ukra.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788280", "eventUri": "eng-9788280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Both times, it seems, by Ukrainian cruise missiles.\n\nOn or just before Saturday, the 10-year-old Rostov-on-Don was in the port of Sevastopol, in Russian-occupied Crimea, when a Ukrainian missile apparently streaked in. \"As a result of the attack, the submarine sank,\" the Ukrainian defense ministry claimed.\n\n\"Great work, warriors,\" the ministry added. \"The Black Sea fish will enjoy their new home.\"\n\nSatellite imagery of Sevastopol in the aftermath of the purported attack is tantalizing but inconclusive. It may depict damage from the missile strike; it may not.\n\nIf better imagery or other evidence confirms the sinking, it will represent a deeply embarrassing loss for the battered Black Sea Fleet. With its three dozen large warships, the fleet massively outweighed the tiny Ukrainian fleet in the early days of Russia's wider war on Ukraine 29 months ago.\n\nBut even after its last few big ships sank to the bottom of the Black Sea, the Ukrainian navy kept fighting, often coordinating its attacks with the Ukrainian air force.\n\nStriking with drone boats and cruise missiles, the Ukrainians destroyed or damaged a third of the Russians' ships -- including their flagship, the missile cruiser Moskva, sunk by a pair of Ukrainian missiles in April 2022.\n\nRostov-on-Don was a recent victim. On Sept. 13, a Ukrainian air force Sukhoi Su-24 bomber fired what were probably British-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles at Sevastopol, striking Rostov-on-Don and a neighboring amphibious ship while the two vessels were in drydock for maintenance.\n\nThe missile that hit Rostov-on-Don didn't just damage the 240-foot, 3,100-ton vessel. No, the missile's two-part tandem warhead first punched a hole in the submarine and then exploded inside. Photos from the aftermath of the raid revealed extensive internal and external damage.\n\nIncredibly, the Russians kept working on Rostov-on-Don, clearly determined to return the devastated vessel to front-line service. Work continued even as the rest of the Black Sea Fleet retreated from the increasingly vulnerable Crimean ports and redeployed to ports in southern Russia.\n\nBy this summer, the Kilo-class submarine was all but alone in Sevastopol. Her hull patched up, she reportedly left drydock in June for tentative trials in the harbor.\n\nThese trials may have been ongoing when the Ukrainians targeted Rostov-on-Don a second time -- perhaps with another Storm Shadow, or possibly with a similar French-made SCALP-EG missile or a locally-made Neptune missile.\n\nThe defense ministry in Kyiv expressed confidence in the results. \"A Russian submarine went to the bottom of the Black Sea,\" it announced. The rest of us should await hard evidence that Rostov-on-Don suffered the extreme embarrassment of getting blown up twice in 11 months.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Ukraine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-class_submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilo-class submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Moskva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian cruiser Moskva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_dock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dry dock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-24", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sukhoi Su-24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flagship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Sub_Sea_Tours", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Sub Sea Tours", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66ae6d62e7a96a871e864840/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=690,517,x0,y9,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788280", "eventUri": "eng-9788280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-13", "textStart": 1577, "textEnd": 1585}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Russia said Ukrainian drones also hit an apartment building, killing one person.\n\nThe uptick in attacks since July come as Ukraine mounts pressure on allies to allow it to use long-range missiles to strike targets in Russia. Western allies, in particular the U.S., have so far resisted, fearing escalation from Moscow.\n\nUkraine struck a Russian Kilo-class submarine and an S-400 anti aircraft missile complex in the Moscow-occupied Crimean peninsula, according to a statement from the General Staff on Saturday. The air defense system was established to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge, an important logistics and transport hub supplying Russian forces.\n\nUnits of the missile forces, as well as the Navy damaged four launchers of the Triumph air defense system, while in the port of Sevastopol, the \"Rostov-on-Don\" -- a submarine of Russia's Black Sea fleet -- was attacked and sank, the statement said.\n\nThe General Staff also confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region after launching a massive drone barrage on Russia. Hits were recorded in warehouses with ammunition, where guided aerial bombs were stored. The operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Defense Ministry, the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said that a woman was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on an apartment building in the town of Shebekino early Sunday. Ukrainian drones also damaged several other buildings in the town, he said.\n\nGladkov said eight civilians have been wounded in the region by Ukrainian shelling and dozens of drone strikes since the previous day.\n\nIn the span of a month, Russia has experienced a surge in the tempo of Ukrainian drone barrages and long-range attacks, targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields and oil depots. Analysts say such an intensification is needed if Ukraine is to degrade Russian capabilities.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Russian defence ministry has not commented.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv said the attack also destroyed four S-400 air defence systems protecting the peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nIntelligence officials in the UK noted last September that the Rostov-on-Don \"likely suffered catastrophic damage\" in a missile strike while undergoing maintenance at a Sevastopol shipyard.\n\nUkraine's military said Russia subsequently repaired the vessel and it was recently testing its capabilities near Sevastopol. The vessel was worth $300m (\u00a3233m), they added.\n\n\"The destruction of Rostov-on-Don once again proves that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,\" the general staff in Kyiv said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIt marks the latest attack on Russian naval forces in Sevastopol in recent months. In March alone, Ukraine said it hit two landing ships and a patrol vessel in the port city.\n\nSince Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it has suffered several major naval setbacks. Ukraine says it has seriously damaged or sunk at least 15 warships, including the Black Sea fleet's flagship, the Moskva.\n\nLast week Ukraine's military said Moscow had been forced to withdraw all of its naval assets from the Sea of Azov - a body of water connected to the Black Sea - due to repeated strikes on its vessels.\n\nAnd Russia's internal security service, the FSB, recently said it foiled a Ukrainian plot to destroy its last remaining aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, launched in 1985, has been undergoing repairs since 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian drones targeted a major airfield and oil depots in Russia.\n\nThe attack targeted the Morozovsk airfield, where guided bombs which have recently wreaked havoc on Ukrainian cities, are stored.\n\nOnline footage said to be from the base showed powerful explosions and huge fires, after what appears to be several hits on fuel or ammunition depots. Russia said many of the drones used were shot down, but local authorities have declared a state of emergency around the air base.\n\nOil storage facilities were also targeted in the Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions.\n\nThe attacks come after Russia launched more than 600 guided air bombs towards Ukraine in a week, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHe said that it was crucial that Ukraine stopped Russian aircraft from launching the munitions and said that attacking airfields in Russia to do so was \"quite fair\".\n\nUkraine's allies have previously been reluctant to allow it to strike within Russia using Western weapons, though the US has recently granted Kyiv permission to attack some targets along the border.\n\nEarlier this week Lithuania's foreign minister said the first deliveries of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine. Long promised by Kyiv's Nato allies, President Zelenky views the planes as central to his country's air defence plans.\n\nThe Times newspaper reported that six jets donated by the Netherlands had arrived in the country, but Dutch defence officials declined to comment when approached by the BBC earlier this week.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business

The Russian defence ministry has not commented.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv said the attack also destroyed four S-400 air defence systems protecting the peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nIntelligence officials in the UK noted last September that the Rostov-on-Don \"likely suffered catastrophic damage\" in a missile strike while undergoing maintenance at a Sevastopol shipyard.\n\nUkraine's military said Russia subsequently repaired the vessel and it was recently testing its capabilities near Sevastopol. The vessel was worth $300m (\u00a3233m), they added.\n\n\"The destruction of Rostov-on-Don once again proves that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,\" the general staff in Kyiv said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIt marks the latest attack on Russian naval forces in Sevastopol in recent months. In March alone, Ukraine said it hit two landing ships and a patrol vessel in the port city.\n\nLast week Ukraine's military said Moscow had been forced to withdraw all of its naval assets from the Sea of Azov - a body of water connected to the Black Sea - due to repeated strikes on its vessels.\n\nAnd Russia's internal security service, the FSB, recently said it foiled a Ukrainian plot to destroy its last remaining aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, launched in 1985, has been undergoing repairs since 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian drones targeted a major airfield and oil depots in Russia.\n\nThe attack targeted the Morozovsk airfield, where guided bombs which have recently wrecked havoc on Ukrainian cities, are stored.\n\nOnline footage said to be from the base showed powerful explosions and huge fires, after what appears to be several hits on fuel or ammunition depots. Russia said many of the drones used were shot down, but local authorities have declared a state of emergency around the air base.\n\nOil storage facilities were also targeted in the Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions.\n\nThe attacks come after Russia launched more than 600 guided air bombs towards Ukraine in a week, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHe said that it was crucial that Ukraine stopped Russian aircraft from launching the munitions and said that attacking airfields in Russia to do so was \"quite fair\".\n\nUkraine's allies have previously been reluctant to allow it to strike within Russia using Western weapons, though the US has recently granted Kyiv permission to attack some targets along the border.\n\nEarlier this week Lithuania's foreign minister said the first deliveries of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine. Long promised by Kyiv's Nato allies, President Zelenky views the planes as central to his country's air defence plans.\n\nThe Times newspaper reported that six jets donated by the Netherlands had arrived in the country, but Dutch defence officials declined to comment when approached by the BBC earlier this week.__BBC", "source": {"uri": "voiceofvienna.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

In total, 75 drones were shot down in the attack, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\nSank on Spot\n\nSeparately, the General Staff said in a Facebook post that the Russian B-237 submarine \"Rostov-on-Don\" was struck in the port of Sevastopol on the annexed Crimea peninsula on Friday.\n\n\"As a result of the hit, the boat sank on the spot,\" the General Staff said.\n\nThe Kilo-class submarine, capable of firing cruise missiles, was damaged in an shipyard attack in September 2023 and was being tested after undergoing repairs, according to Ukraine's statement, which also claimed a hit on an anti-aircraft missile complex in Crimea.\n\nRussia hasn't commented.\n\nUkraine continues to target military objects and other facilities used by Kremlin forces in their invasion in Ukraine, now well into the third year, including fuel depots, oil and gas refineries and anti-missile defense radars.\n\nGlide bombs are equipped with flight control surfaces that can expand their range. This week alone, Russia fired over 600 such projectiles at Ukraine, Zelenskiy said.

Russia said Ukrainian drones also hit an apartment building, killing one person.\n\nThe uptick in attacks since July come as Ukraine mounts pressure on allies to allow it to use long-range missiles to strike targets in Russia. Western allies, in particular the US, have so far resisted, fearing escalation from Moscow, The Associated Press said.\n\nUkraine struck a Russian Kilo-class submarine and an S-400 anti aircraft missile complex in the Moscow-occupied Crimean peninsula, according to a statement from the General Staff on Saturday. The air defense system was established to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge, an important logistics and transport hub supplying Russian forces.\n\nUnits of the missile forces, as well as the Navy damaged four launchers of the Triumph air defense system, while in the port of Sevastopol, the \"Rostov-on-Don\" -- a submarine of Russia's Black Sea fleet -- was attacked and sank, the statement said.\n\nThe General Staff also confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region after launching a massive drone barrage on Russia. Hits were recorded in warehouses with ammunition, where guided aerial bombs were stored. The operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Defense Ministry, the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said that a woman was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on an apartment building in the town of Shebekino early Sunday. Ukrainian drones also damaged several other buildings in the town, he said.\n\nGladkov said eight civilians have been wounded in the region by Ukrainian shelling and dozens of drone strikes since the previous day.\n\nIn the span of a month, Russia has experienced a surge in the tempo of Ukrainian drone barrages and long-range attacks, targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields and oil depots.

The Black Sea fish will enjoy their new home.\"\n\nThe Rostov-on-Don was reportedly one of four submarines operated by Russia's Black Sea fleet. Its demise will likely fuel concerns among Russian authorities that spies are tipping off Ukrainian commanders on the best moments to attack.\n\nH I Sutton, an independent naval analyst, said the submarine was in the middle of repairs when it was attacked, after being damaged in a Ukrainian strike last year.\n\n\"The submarine was hit by Storm Shadow last year. Since then it was moved to a separate berth where it remained vulnerable to a follow-up attack. As happened this morning,\" he said on Saturday.\n\n\"Contrary to some reporting it hadn't been fully repaired but this attack should close the chapter.\"\n\nRussia's Kilo-class submarines were originally designed in the Soviet Union but the programme was updated in the 1990s and several more were built through the 2000s.\n\nThey are diesel-powered and considered the most reliable submarines in the Kremlin's fleet, having been used to fire missiles from the Black Sea at Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe initial strike on the Rostov-on-Don last September infuriated Vladimir Putin who sacked the commander of his Black Sea Fleet and ordered sailors to be given extra drills on how to defend against missile and drone attacks.\n\nUkraine's road of life\n\nUkraine has pummelled the Black Sea Fleet at its main bases in Crimea, forcing it to retreat to Novorossiysk, 250 miles away. The Russian Ministry of Defence said it would build a new base in Abkhazia, a Kremlin-backed Georgian rebel region, 400 miles from Crimea.\n\nOn Ukraine's front line, Russia said its soldiers had seized the village of Novoselivka Persha, the latest in a string of advances, and also claimed that its forces had planted a flag on a road that Ukrainian officials have previously described as a \"critical\" resupplying route.\n\nThe T0504 highway runs from the town of Kostyantynivka, south of Chasiv Yar to Bakhmut.\n\nSergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin propagandist, said: \"This highway runs along the front line and was previously actively used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to transfer units and weapons.\n\n\"In the future, this route will be used by the Russian army for the same function.\"\n\nReports also said that in the town of Chasiv Yar, which has seen some of the fiercest fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces this year, Russian soldiers had breached a canal that runs through its centre.\n\nChasiv Yar is considered a key target for the Russian army as it lies on high ground above a valley that connects three towns used by the Ukrainian army as organisational hubs for its military.\n\nStrategists have said that if Chasiv Yar falls, the Ukrainian front line will become far more fragile as the Russian military will dominate and shell the towns below.",

If true, it would be the second time that Ukraine has carried out a successful strike on a sub at the port.\n\nAccording to Ukraine's General Staff, a flurry of long-range strikes hit ammunition plants, fuel depots and a major airfield within Russian-held territory overnight Friday. Additionally, a missile attack on Sevastopol hit and quickly sank the sub Rostov-on-Don, which had been damaged in a previous strike.\n\nThe Rostov-on-Don was struck by Ukrainian Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles on September 13, 2023, putting two large holes in the hull. The angle of approach for one of the holes suggested that the munition maneuvered in flight to circle around the target and hit from the other side - a capability consistent with Storm Shadow.\n\nThe damage was serious enough that many Western analysts declared the vessel a write-off. However, the Russian Navy vowed to repair the sub and return it to service. It was restored and refloated, and was undergoing testing off the coast of Sevastopol last week. On Friday, Ukrainian forces hit it again in another missile strike, and this time it went down, the General Staff said.\n\nRostov-on-Don was a priority target for Ukraine because of its capability to launch Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles. The Russian Navy has repeatedly attacked civilian targets within Ukraine using the Kalibr and other sea-launched missiles in its inventory; by damaging or destroying Russian warships that venture west of Kerch Strait, Ukraine has corralled most of the missile-capable tonnage in the Black Sea Fleet into the port of Novorossiysk, in the sea's northeast corner.\n\nIn addition to targeting subs and prominent surface combatants - like the cruiser Moskva, the fleet's flagship - Ukraine has also targeted auxiliaries that enable Russian fleet operations. In April, Ukrainian forces hit the sub tender / rescue submersible ship Komunna, one of the oldest operational naval vessels in the world. Kommuna has been in commission for 109 years, serving through both world wars and the Russian civil war.", "source": {"uri": "maritime-executive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maritime Executive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Shadow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm Shadow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Staff (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-class_submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilo-class submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalibr_(missile_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalibr (missile family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cruiser_Moskva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian cruiser Moskva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerch_Strait", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerch Strait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperial Russian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship's_tender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ship's tender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flagship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiysk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novorossiysk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Novorossiysk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Navy_Govt_CoastGuard/B-237-Rostov-on-Don.adec4d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788280", "eventUri": "eng-9788280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-09-", "textStart": 609, "textEnd": 621}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The Russian defence ministry has not commented.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv said the attack also destroyed four S-400 air defence systems protecting the peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nIntelligence officials in the UK noted last September that the Rostov-on-Don \"likely suffered catastrophic damage\" in a missile strike while undergoing maintenance at a Sevastopol shipyard.\n\nUkraine's military said Russia subsequently repaired the vessel and it was recently testing its capabilities near Sevastopol. The vessel was worth $300m (\u00a3233m), they added.\n\n\"The destruction of Rostov-on-Don once again proves that there is no safe place for the Russian fleet in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea,\" the general staff in Kyiv said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIt marks the latest attack on Russian naval forces in Sevastopol in recent months. In March alone, Ukraine said it hit two landing ships and a patrol vessel in the port city.\n\nSince Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 it has suffered several major naval setbacks. Ukraine says it has seriously damaged or sunk at least 15 warships, including the Black Sea fleet's flagship, the Moskva.\n\nLast week Ukraine's military said Moscow had been forced to withdraw all of its naval assets from the Sea of Azov - a body of water connected to the Black Sea - due to repeated strikes on its vessels.\n\nAnd Russia's internal security service, the FSB, recently said it foiled a Ukrainian plot to destroy its last remaining aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, launched in 1985, has been undergoing repairs since 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in Kyiv said Ukrainian drones targeted a major airfield and oil depots in Russia.\n\nThe attack targeted the Morozovsk airfield, where guided bombs which have recently wrecked havoc on Ukrainian cities, are stored.\n\nOnline footage said to be from the base showed powerful explosions and huge fires, after what appears to be several hits on fuel or ammunition depots. Russia said many of the drones used were shot down, but local authorities have declared a state of emergency around the air base.\n\nOil storage facilities were also targeted in the Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod regions.\n\nThe attacks come after Russia launched more than 600 guided air bombs towards Ukraine in a week, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHe said that it was crucial that Ukraine stopped Russian aircraft from launching the munitions and said that attacking airfields in Russia to do so was \"quite fair\".\n\nUkraine's allies have previously been reluctant to allow it to strike within Russia using Western weapons, though the US has recently granted Kyiv permission to attack some targets along the border.\n\nEarlier this week Lithuania's foreign minister said the first deliveries of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine. Long promised by Kyiv's Nato allies, President Zelenky views the planes as central to his country's air defence plans.\n\nThe Times newspaper reported that six jets donated by the Netherlands had arrived in the country, but Dutch defence officials declined to comment when approached by the BBC earlier this week.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv will also hope that the jets can help arrest Russian momentum on the frontlines. Moscow's forces have been making incremental gains in the east of the country for several weeks.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They also said a long-range drone strike on an air base in a Russian region neighboring Ukraine had destroyed an ammunition depot that stored glide bombs that are causing severe damage to Ukraine's forces.\n\n(...)", "source": {"uri": "caldeiraodebolsa.jornaldenegocios.pt", "dataType": "news", "title": "caldeiraodebolsa.jornaldenegocios.pt"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sevastopol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rostov-on-Don"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-400_missile_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S-400 missile system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glide bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788280", "eventUri": "eng-9788280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

announcement.\n\n\"Everything is quiet in the city,\" he wrote, while also warning of an upcoming training exercise.\n\nUkraine's military said the B-237 Rostov-on-Don \"is one of four Kilo-class submarines capable of using 'Kalibr' missiles.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that sub, which Ukraine says cost Russia $300 million, has been targeted in the conflict.\n\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in September that the submarine had \"likely suffered catastrophic damage\" following a missile strike on a shipyard in Sevastopol.\n\n\"Any effort to return the submarine to service is likely to take many years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" the MoD said at the time.\n\nDespite having no traditional navy of its own, Ukraine has had huge success battling the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nMany of the fleet's ships have been forced to relocate eastward from the naval base in Sevastopol to Novorossiysk, and it has also lost a number of key warships, including its flagship, the Moskva.\n\nIn addition to striking the submarine, the General Staff said Ukrainian forces had also severely damaged four S-400 antiaircraft missile launchers.\n\nFrederik Mertens, a former strategic analyst at the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, previously told BI that by targeting Crimea and defense systems such as the S-400, Ukraine was likely \"preparing the ground\" for the use of F-16

Brit-supplied Storm Shadow missile from fighter jets in a strike that hit Putin's Black Sea Fleet HQ last year.\n\nUkraine released the unique footage of the moment of launch from an Su-24 aerial bomber of missiles to destroy the Headquarters.\n\nUnbelievable footage shows missiles being released from the warplane ahead of the strike on the HQ in Sevastopol.\n\nThe clip skips to show plumes of smoke billowing into the air above the base.\n\nOnlookers watch on in disbelief at the strike that occurred last year.\n\nThe commander of Kyiv's air force, General Mykola Oleshchuk, released last year's footage marking Ukrainian Air Force Day.\n\nThe proud General said: \"Victory on the ground is forged in heaven.\"\n\nDespite the strike on the Black Sea Fleet HQ taking place in September 2023, this is the first time in the war footage has been seen of the release of a Storm Shadow from a Ukrainian war plane.\n\nIt is an Su-24 supersonic, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing aircraft.\n\nThe Storm Shadow is a long-range air-launched cruise missile developed by Britain and France.\n\nThey can travel up to a whopping 600mph and blast targets up to 350 miles away.\n\nBritain led Western countries in supplying war-torn Ukraine with long range missiles.\n\nOleshchuk said: \"This became possible thanks to the powerful support of our Western partners.\n\n\"I thank them for their conscious position in the defence of peace and democracy, our people.\n\n\"The soldiers of the Air Force showed great courage, heroism, professionalism and ingenuity and high-quality and skilful use of modern Western weapons.\"\n\nThe destruction of the headquarters forced Russia to move its Black Sea command and fleet further east from Sevastopol, in annexed Crimea.\n\nMany of Putin's remaining warships are now based in Novorossiysk - further from Ukraine's reach.\n\nThe old footage comes after Ukraine obliterated one of Putin's prized Black Sea submarines in an impressive attack on occupied Crimea.\n\nKyiv forces said the prized Kilo-class Rostov-on-Don vessel, worth \u00a3275 million, was hit in a missile barrage on the Sevastopol port.\n\nUkraine's attack on Friday also \"significantly damaged\" four of Putin's ultramodern S-400 air defence systems - worth in total around \u00a32 billion.\n\nKyiv claimed the missile barrage also targeted four vital launches of Russia's \"Triumf\" air defence system.\n\nThe Kilo-class Rostov submarine - used to fire calibre class missiles on Ukraine - had been hit in September last year, but was then repaired.\n\nIt was due to go back into service when Ukraine staged the lethal strike on Friday night.\n\nUkrainian forces used deadly US-made ATACMS missiles for the hit.\n\nThe mammoth sub was on sea trials in the water around Sevastopol when it was sunk, according to reports.\n\nKyiv is known for its impressive targeting of Russian naval targets amid Putin's illegal war in Ukraine and the sub marks a big milestone for Zelensky's forces.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Shadow",

Brit-supplied Storm Shadow missile from fighter jets in a strike that hit Putin's Black Sea Fleet HQ last year.\n\nUkraine released the unique footage of the moment of launch from an Su-24 aerial bomber of missiles to destroy the Headquarters.\n\nUnbelievable footage shows missiles being released from the warplane ahead of the strike on the HQ in Sevastopol.\n\nThe clip skips to show plumes of smoke billowing into the air above the base.\n\nOnlookers watch on in disbelief at the strike that occurred last year.\n\nThe commander of Kyiv's air force, General Mykola Oleshchuk, released last year's footage marking Ukrainian Air Force Day.\n\nThe proud General said: \"Victory on the ground is forged in heaven.\"\n\nDespite the strike on the Black Sea Fleet HQ taking place in September 2023, this is the first time in the war footage has been seen of the release of a Storm Shadow from a Ukrainian war plane.\n\nIt is an Su-24 supersonic, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing aircraft.\n\nThe Storm Shadow is a long-range air-launched cruise missile developed by Britain and France.\n\nThey can travel up to a whopping 600mph and blast targets up to 350 miles away.\n\nBritain led Western countries in supplying war-torn Ukraine with long range missiles.\n\nOleshchuk said: \"This became possible thanks to the powerful support of our Western partners.\n\n\"I thank them for their conscious position in the defence of peace and democracy, our people.\n\n\"The soldiers of the Air Force showed great courage, heroism, professionalism and ingenuity and high-quality and skilful use of modern Western weapons.\"\n\nThe destruction of the headquarters forced Russia to move its Black Sea command and fleet further east from Sevastopol, in annexed Crimea.\n\nMany of Putin's remaining warships are now based in Novorossiysk - further from Ukraine's reach.\n\nThe old footage comes after Ukraine obliterated one of Putin's prized Black Sea submarines in an impressive attack on occupied Crimea.\n\nKyiv forces said the prized Kilo-class Rostov-on-Don vessel, worth \u00a3275 million, was hit in a missile barrage on the Sevastopol port.\n\nUkraine's attack on Friday also \"significantly damaged\" four of Putin's ultramodern S-400 air defence systems - worth in total around \u00a32 billion.\n\nKyiv claimed the missile barrage also targeted four vital launches of Russia's \"Triumf\" air defence system.\n\nThe Kilo-class Rostov submarine - used to fire calibre class missiles on Ukraine - had been hit in September last year, but was then repaired.\n\nIt was due to go back into service when Ukraine staged the lethal strike on Friday night.\n\nUkrainian forces used deadly US-made ATACMS missiles for the hit.\n\nThe mammoth sub was on sea trials in the water around Sevastopol when it was sunk, according to reports.\n\nKyiv is known for its impressive targeting of Russian naval targets amid Putin's illegal war in Ukraine and the sub marks a big milestone for Zelensky's forces.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annabel_bate@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Annabel Bate", "type": "author",

Landing ships and other vessels, like the missile-armed Tsiklon warship in May and the Sergei Kotov in March were among the casualties.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said in July at least 26 Russian vessels had been damaged or destroyed while one estimate in March by the Hudson Institute think tank said that Kyiv was on track to eliminate half the fleet by 2025.\n\nAdmiral Sir Tony Radakin, the U.K. chief of the defense staff, said that Ukraine had brought the Russian fleet \"to heel\" through drones and long-range missiles and Ukraine's navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk recently said Russia's \"last patrol ship\" was moving away from Crimea.\n\n\"There is no chance right now for the Russian Navy to reestablish itself in the Western parts of the Black Sea as they have lost many assets,\" said I\u015f\u0131k. \"Because of Turkey's closure of the Bosporus, Russia has no ability to bring in new assets into the Black Sea except for a limited number of smaller units from the Caspian Sea.\"\n\nHowever, I\u015f\u0131k said it was notable that Moscow is also looking to establish another base in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia, which is internationally recognized as a part of Georgia, but it is controlled by de facto separatist authorities. Moscow has recognized Abkhazia as an independent state, while Tbilisi considers it occupied by Russia.\n\nI\u015f\u0131k said that Russia would soon send a tug vessel to assist submarines at the site in Ochamchire, a seaside town where a small naval facility used by Russia's fishing fleet would be repurposed. \"The Russian Navy is not only just moving east to Novorossiysk but looking further, in the southeast corner of the Black Sea -- away from any possible Ukrainian attack and safe harbor.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with little progress on the front line in Ukraine and the Russian prisoner swap in which the Kremlin might try to push a narrative that it can negotiate the end of the war, Kyiv's latest strike on a Black Sea Fleet vessel has been timely, said I\u015f\u0131k.\n\n\"It's important that Ukraine comes up with these successful operations that show it can prosecute the war it can still win.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [],

He has given up one run in his last 18 innings, although this was his first decision in that stretch. He walked two and made only 86 pitches.\n\n\"Talk about pounding the zone,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \"Throwing strikes, getting early-count contact. It was fantastic.\n\n\"When you haven't pitched here before, there are some unknowns when you go out there. Is your breaking ball going to break like it normally does? Am I going to get winded? All those things there is some uncertainty about didn't seem to bother him at all.\"\n\nThe Giants, who snapped a four-game skid, ended an 11-game streak of scoring no more than four runs in one game, a day after Melvin held a post-game meeting following a 6-1 loss at Philadelphia.\n\n\"It was well-timed,\" said Nick Ahmed, who had two hits.\n\n\"We didn't play well in Philly. We got embarrassed. They are a good team, but we didn't play our best baseball.

Any time you have two strikeouts, you had a hell of a defense behind you. They made some great plays.\"\n\nJacob Stallings walked and Elehuris Montero singled with two outs in the second off Harrison, who got out of that inning on a groundout and retired 10 of the next 11.\n\n\"We couldn't square up the fastball,\" Colorado manager Bud Black said, \"and he threw enough changeups and sliders in certain counts and he got us.

That ignited a six-run rally by - let's double check - yes, an aggressive Giants squad that failed to score that many runs in any of their previous 14 games.\n\nThis marked only the fourth time this season the Giants (17-21) have won back-to-back games. Thursday's 12:10 p.m. PT start pits the Giants' Keaton Winn (3-4, 4.41) against Cal Quantrill (1-3, 4.31).\n\nThe Giants return to Oracle Park on Friday night for a nine-game homestand, with three-game sets against the Cincinnati Reds, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Rockies.\n\nThe Rockies fell to an MLB-worst 8-28 with their ninth loss in their past 10 games; they've been swept in four previous series this season.\n\nWednesday's six-run rally matched the Giants' most runs in an inning since a March 30 win San Diego, in their third game of the season.\n\nAfter Conforto turned on an inside fastball for sixth home run of the season (and first in 13 games), the Giants got three consecutive singles, from Matt Chapman, Mike Yastrzemski and Heliot Ramos, the latter of whom got called up from Triple-A Sacramento for not just his season debut but his initiation to hitter-friendly Coors Field.\n\nRamos' opposite-field, RBI single scored Chapman for a 2-0 lead. Showing off the hitting prowess that had him batting .296 with eight home runs and 21 RBIs in Sacramento, Ramos fell behind 0-2 in his initial at-bat in Colorado, then he fouled off a 1-2 fastball before lining a 94.2-mph sinker to right field.\n\nRamos served as the designated hitter as the Giants placed slumping slugger Jorge Soler on the 10-day injured list with a shoulder strain. Ramos had hit just .158 in big league cameos the past two seasons covering 34 games.\n\nThe Giants' lead climbed to 3-0 when Yastrzemski dove head-first to safely score on Nick Ahmed's surprising, one-out bunt. Jung Hoo Lee made it 4-0 by drilling a slider 105 mph off the right-field wall and driving in Ramos. A two-out, two-RBI flare by LaMonte Wade Jr. pushed the Giants' lead to 6-0, and Conforto followed with a single for his second hit of the inning, before Chapman flew out to end the long-sought rally.\n\nAnother run came the next inning, when a Blake Sabol double scored Ystrzemski for a 7-1 lead.\n\nThat proved a wide enough berth to improve Giants starter Jordan Hicks' record to 3-1.\n\nThe first hit Hicks allowed was a 420-foot triple to Brenton Doyle off the center-field wall, on an 0-2, two-out fastball in the bottom of the second; Doyle would score on a passed ball charged to catcher Blake Sabol, for a 6-1 deficit.\n\nHicks did his share to protect that lead, though he had to work out of jams. Back-to-back strikeouts stranded two Rockies in the fourth, and after Colorado scratched across two runs in the fifth, Hicks induced an inning-ending double play. That ended his night (three runs, seven hits, five strikeouts, two walks in 92 pitches).\n\nReliever Sean Hjelle yielded two hits to the four batters he faced before Taylor Rogers allowed an RBI single to Charlie Blackmon, cutting the Giants' lead to 7-4 through six innings. The Giants took an 8-4 lead in the eighth, when Chapman's infield single prompted an errant throw to bring in Conforto, who reached on a nine-pitch, two-out walk.\n\nGiants closer Camilo Duval walked the first two batters he faced in the ninth. Then he induced a double-play grounder, and that involved him rushing over to cover first base for the second out. But Duval's next pitch resulted in an Ellias Diaz home run, cutting the Giants' lead to 8-6. That's as close as Colorado could get, as Duval got Brendan Rogers to ground out to Nick Ahmed to end it.\n\nConforto finished 3 for 4 with a walk and two runs scored. Sabol went 3 for 4 with an RBI double. Yasztrzemski was 2 for 4 with a triple and two runs scored.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cam_inman@star-telegram.com", "name": "Cam Inman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

It is time to continue our MLB odds series with a Giants-Rockies prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants head into the high altitude of Coors Field on Tuesday evening for a battle with the Colorado Rockies. This matchup has the potential for offensive fireworks as both teams boast potent lineups. The Giants look to regain rhythm after a shaky stretch, while the Rockies are never to be underestimated on their home turf. Expect a high-scoring affair as both teams look to unleash their power under the Colorado sky.\n\nCoors Field sets the stage for a potential slugfest Tuesday evening as the Colorado Rockies welcome in the San Francisco Giants. The Rockies are ready to showcase their notorious home-field power, fueled by the thin Denver air. The Giants, aiming to bounce back from recent struggles, possess the pitching capable of challenging the Rockies. This clash of NL West rivals promises to be a test of offense versus pitching\n\nThe San Francisco Giants head into the high altitude of Coors Field on Tuesday evening, looking to silence the Colorado Rockies. While Coors Field is notorious for its offensive fireworks, it's Kyle Harrison on the mound for the Giants who could steal the show and hand the Rockies a home loss.\n\nHarrison, a young left-hander with an arsenal of deceptive pitches, could be the key to taming the Rockies' lineup. He boasts a wicked sinker that can induce ground balls and a surprisingly effective changeup that keeps hitters guessing. Even in the thin air of Denver, those two pitches can disrupt the timing of most big league hitters. While he doesn't possess overpowering stuff, his command and ability to pitch to contact give him an edge.\n\nFurthermore, the Giants' lineup is capable of providing run support. They possess a mix of veteran hitters like Michael Conforto and newcomers like Jung Hoo Lee who have the ability to drive the ball even in the challenging environment of Coors Field. Look for the Giants to play a more patient style, working deep into counts and forcing Rockies' starter Dakota Hudson to labor.\n\nWhile Hudson possesses a respectable fastball and decent off-speed pitches, he's prone to inconsistency and high pitch counts. If the Giants can force him out of the game early, the Rockies' bullpen could be vulnerable.\n\nThe Giants, often overshadowed by NL West rivals, shouldn't be taken lightly. Their pitching staff has flown under the radar this season, and their offense can be surprisingly opportunistic. If Harrison can navigate the thin air and induce weak contact, and if the Giants find some timely hitting, they could steal an unexpected victory in the hitter-friendly confines of Coors Field.\n\nWhy The Rockies Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nGet ready for a potential offensive explosion at Coors Field on Tuesday night as the Colorado Rockies host the San Francisco Giants. The Rockies, fueled by the power of their home park and a lineup built for the high altitude, are poised to put up a crooked number against Giants' starter Kyle Harrison.\n\nCoors Field is notoriously a hitters' paradise, amplifying power and turning fly balls into home runs. The Rockies' lineup thrives in this environment, with dangerous hitters like Elias Diaz and Ryan McMahon ready to punish any mistakes from Harrison, a young pitcher who could be rattled by the conditions.\n\nDakota Hudson, the Rockies' starter, thrives in the familiar confines of Coors Field. While he may not be a true ace, he knows how to pitch in Denver, often relying on his groundball-inducing sinker to limit damage. If he can keep the Giants off the scoreboard early, the Rockies' bats could break the game open.\n\nThe Rockies possess an offense that's heating up. Expect a relentless approach, with hitters looking to capitalize on Harrison's inexperience and force him into high-stress situations. Their bullpen, while not perfect, has enough firepower to protect a lead at home.\n\nThe Giants, though capable of playing spoiler, have shown inconsistent offense on the road. The combination of Coors Field, a hungry Rockies team, and a young pitcher under pressure could lead to a big night for the home squad.\n\nFinal Giants-Rockies Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be an exciting matchup between these two teams in the high altitude of Coors Field. While the Giants lineup is inconsistent at times they are still a formidable lineup and they are going to give Dakota Hudson some problems, especially in hitter-friendly Coors Field. It's up to Kyle Harrison to limit the damage on his side and if he can do so expect the Giants to pounce on Hudson and get a much-needed road victory to continue their climb in the NL West.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dakota Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Conforto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Conforto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McMahon (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoreboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoreboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Characters", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Giants-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He walked two.\n\n\"Talk about pounding the zone,\" Giants Manager Bob Melvin said. \"Throwing strikes, getting early-count contact.

Colorado fell to 8-27, extending the worst start in franchise history.\n\nSan Francisco's Jung Hoo Lee extended his hitting streak to five games with his first career three-hit game, one out of the infield.\n\nHarrison is the sixth Giants starter to throw at least seven shutout innings at Coors Field, the first since Barry Zito on April 9, 2012.\n\n\"I felt great out there,\" Harrison said. \"The shapes of pitches were fine. Any time you have two strikeouts, you had a hell of a defense behind you. They made some great plays.\"\n\nJacob Stallings walked and Elehuris Montero singled with two outs in the second off Harrison, who got out of that inning on a groundout and retired 10 of the next 11 batters.\n\n\"We couldn't square up the fastball,\" Colorado Manager Bud Black said, \"and he threw enough changeups and sliders in certain counts, and he got us. He pitched well. He didn't throw. He pitched.\"\n\nAhmed had two hits and an RBI to raise his career batting average at Coors Field to .335.\n\nMichael Conforto drove in the Giants' final run with a single in the seventh.\n\nAfter Matt Chapman walked and Blake Sabol singled to right off Dakota Hudson (0-6) with one out in the fourth inning, Ahmed hit a slow roller that third baseman Ryan McMahon could not handle.

That ignited a six-run rally by -- let's double check -- yes, an aggressive Giants squad that failed to score that many runs in any of their previous 14 games.\n\nThis marked only the fourth time this season the Giants (17-21) have won back-to-back games. Thursday's 12:10 p.m. PT start pits the Giants' Keaton Winn (3-4, 4.41) against Cal Quantrill (1-3, 4.31).\n\nAfter beating the Rockies 5-0 on Monday behind Kyle Harrison's seven shutout innings, the Giants continued to make offensive strides, and manager Bob Melvin wasn't going to credit that to playing in a hitter-friendly, mile-high ballpark.\n\n\"Our bats have been better this series. I've never going to discount that,\" Melvin told reporters after the game.\n\nColorado fell to a MLB-worst 8-28 with its ninth loss in the past 10 games; the Rockies have been swept in four previous series this season. The Giants return to Oracle Park on Friday night for a nine-game homestand, with three-game sets against the Cincinnati Reds, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Rockies again.\n\nWednesday's six-run rally matched the Giants' most runs in an inning since a March 30 win San Diego, their third game of the season.\n\nAfter Conforto turned on an inside fastball for his sixth home run of the season (and first in 13 games), the Giants got three consecutive singles, from Matt Chapman, Mike Yastrzemski and Heliot Ramos, the latter of whom got called up from Triple-A Sacramento for not just his season debut but his initiation to hitter-friendly Coors Field.\n\nRamos' opposite-field, RBI single scored Chapman for a 2-0 lead. Showing off the hitting prowess that had him batting .296 with eight home runs and 21 RBI in Sacramento, Ramos fell behind 0-2 in his initial at-bat in Colorado, then he fouled off a 1-2 fastball before lining a 94.2-mph sinker to right field.\n\nRamos served as the designated hitter as the Giants placed slumping slugger Jorge Soler on the 10-day Injury List with a shoulder strain. Ramos had hit just .158 in big-league cameos the past two seasons covering 34 games.\n\nThe Giants' lead climbed to 3-0 when Yastrzemski dove head-first to safely score on Nick Ahmed's surprising, one-out bunt. Jung Hoo Lee made it 4-0 by drilling a slider 105 mph off the right-field wall and driving in Ramos. A two-out, two-RBI flare by LaMonte Wade Jr. pushed the Giants' lead to 6-0, and Conforto followed with a single for his second hit of the inning, before Chapman flew out to end the long-sought rally.\n\nAnother run came the next inning, when a Blake Sabol double scored Ystrzemski for a 7-1 lead.\n\nThat proved a wide enough berth to improve Giants starter Jordan Hicks' record to 3-1.\n\n\"This is his first time starting here, so the breaking balls are always, kind of, see how it goes when you're here and if you have to make any adjustments with it,\" Melvin said. \"So, yeah, maybe not his best command. He threw a lot of pitches (92), but at the end of the day, he gives us five solid innings and gets the win.\"\n\nThe first hit Hicks allowed was a 420-foot triple to Brenton Doyle off the center-field wall, on an 0-2, two-out fastball in the bottom of the second; Doyle would score on a passed ball charged to catcher Blake Sabol, for a 6-1 deficit.\n\nHicks did his share to protect that lead, though he had to work out of jams. Back-to-back strikeouts stranded two Rockies in the fourth, and after Colorado scratched across two runs in the fifth, Hicks induced an inning-ending double play. That ended his night (three runs, seven hits, five strikeouts, two walks in 92 pitches).\n\nReliever Sean Hjelle yielded two hits to the four batters he faced before Taylor Rogers allowed an RBI single to Charlie Blackmon, cutting the Giants' lead to 7-4 through six innings. The Giants took an 8-4 lead in the eighth, when Chapman's infield single prompted an errant throw to bring in Conforto, who reached on a nine-pitch, two-out walk.\n\nGiants closer Camilo Duval walked the first two batters he faced in the ninth. Then he induced a double-play grounder, and that involved him rushing over to cover first base for the second out. But Duval's next pitch resulted in an Ellias Diaz home run, cutting the Giants' lead to 8-6. That's as close as Colorado could get, as Duval got Brendan Rogers to ground out to Nick Ahmed to end it.\n\nConforto finished 3-for-4 with a walk and two runs scored. Sabol went 3-for-4 with an RBI double. Yasztrzemski was 2-for-4 with a triple and two runs scored.", "source": {"uri": "montereyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Monterey Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Not after the Rockies came home from a 1-7 road trip and promptly lost 5-0 to the Giants on a chilly Tuesday night at Coors Field. Colorado, which now owns an 8-27 record, was shut out for the sixth time this season.\n\nGiants left-hander Kyle Harrison dominated the Rockies for seven scoreless innings, allowing just four hits (all singles), walking two, and striking out two. He induced 11 outs via groundballs.\n\nThe Rockies made a tiny bit of noise in the ninth when Brendan Rodgers and Sean Bouchard drew one-out walks off reliever Camilo Doval, but he struck out Jacob Stallings and Elehuris Montero to close out the game.\n\nThe Giants' game-clinching, four-run fourth inning was sprinkled with a lot of luck and a couple of clutch hits. Matt Chapman drew a one-out walk off Hudson and sprinted to third on Blake Sabol's solid single to right. Chapman scored on Nick Ahmed's swinging base-hit bunt that third baseman Ryan McMahon couldn't pick off the infield grass.\n\nJung Hoo Lee followed with another lucky infield hit, again to McMahon, and Thairo Estrada's groundout to second scored Sabol from third. That was it for Hudson. He was replaced by lefty Ty Blach, who came in to face the left-handed hitting LaMonte Wade Jr. But manager Bud Black's left-on-left strategy didn't work out. Wade, who's hitting .355, ripped Blach's 1-2 sinker into right field, driving in two runs.\n\nHudson and Stallings, the veteran catcher, were the Rockies' only two free-agent acquisitions. The Hudson signing has not worked out, at least not so far. In 3 2/3 innings Tuesday, he was charged with four runs on five hits. He walked four and struck out two. After seven starts, Hudson is 0-6 with a 6.35 ERA.\n\nSan Francisco's fifth run came in the seventh on Michael Conforto's run-scoring single off Blach. Estrada led off the inning with a single off Blach and moved into scoring position when Blach walked Wade.\n\nThere are a lot of statistics that help explain the worst start in Rockies history, but one of the most telling is this: With runners in scoring position, opposing teams are hitting .343 (108 for 315) against Rockies pitchers.\n\nGiants RHP Jordan Hicks (2-1, 1.89 ERA) at Rockies RHP Peter Lambert (2-1, 5.66)\n\n6:40 p.m. Wednesday, Coors Field\n\nTV: Rockies.TV (streaming); Comcast/Xfinity (channel 1262); DirecTV (683); Spectrum (130, 445, 305, 435 or 445, depending on region).\n\nRadio: 850 AM/94.1 FM\n\nLambert wants to be a permanent part of the starting rotation, but to do that, he's got to find some consistency. In his two starts this season, he is 0-1 with a 14.21 ERA. In his seven games as a long reliever, he is 2-0 with a 1.88 ERA. In his last start, he was chased after just 3 1/3 innings, having allowed four runs on five hits at Miami. The right-hander is 0-1 with a 6.95 ERA in five games (four starts) vs. the Giants. He got hammered at San Francisco's Oracle Park on Sept. 10 last season, allowing six runs on eight hits, including three home runs.\n\nSome pundits questioned the Giants' decision to convert Hicks from a reliever to a starter after signing him during the offseason. But so far, it's paid off, even though Hicks took the loss last Friday vs. the Phillies when he allowed four runs (two earned) on four hits and four walks over four innings. He struck out three. He has yet to allow more than two earned runs through his first seven starts. In seven relief appearances against Colorado (7 2/3 innings), he's 1-1 with a 4.70 ERA. In three appearances (four innings) at Coors Field he has a 4.50 ERA.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That's the state of the San Francisco Giants: I'm anticipating 9 to 12 plate appearances over the next three days more than anything else.\n\nSure, the Giants have a very good shot at taking the series, even sweeping the series, which would put them at either 17-22 or 18-21 as they return to Oracle Park at the end of the week. On the other hand, this is Coors Field. This is that danged Dinger. This is a Giants team that might not be that much better than the Rockies at this present moment.\n\nBut Jung Hoo Lee getting those big open spaces to slap the ball into and team pitching and defense that should make that easier for a guy with his contact skills to do? The prospects of that turning out quite nicely are rather high.\n\nHold on, though. Are the Giants close to being as bad as the Rockies? The Giants have a team wRC+ of 96, which is #20 in MLB and just by the eye test is starting to make me question the validity of the measure. Oh, but there are the Rockies at #29 with... 74??? 26% worse than the league average? Wait -- they've scored just 123 runs in 34 games. That's 3.6 runs per game. They're averaging 4 runs per game at home and allowing 6 per. The Rockies have a team fWAR of 1.0 on a 5.65 ERA (4.69 FIP). That's 27th in MLB. Giants are 22nd (2.2 fWAR, 4.60 ERA/3.92 FIP), which is bad, but better. The Rockies' early season defense has been bad, The Giants have been average.\n\nSo, on paper, the Giants are better than the Rockies and they have recent history on their side. The Giants are 11-6 in Coors the past two seasons. On the other hand, the Giants are 17-42 on the road going back to the 2nd half of last season (including losing 3 of 4 in September at Coors) and 40-61 if you go back to the start of last season. Any road stadium would seem to be a problem for the Giants in recent history.\n\nThis is why I'll be pushing all my rooting chips in behind Jung Hoo Lee for the next three days. Sure, we don't know how the altitude will effect him (or the other gassed Giants hitters for that matter), and he's been absolutely dreadful on this road trip -- his two hits yesterday raised his line to .194/.194/.194 in 31 plate appearances with 6 singles and 2 strikeouts -- but if anyone's bat is primed to take advantage it's got to be his.\n\nTuesday: Kyle Harrison vs. Dakota Hudson\n\nWednesday: Jordan Hicks vs. Peter Lambert\n\nThursday: Keaton Winn vs. Cal Quantrill\n\nRyan McMahon: He really soaks up all the oxygen when it comes to the Rockies' starting lineup. Not only does he lead it with a 136 wRC+ by way of the most home runs (5) and walks (20), he also strikes out a lot (43 in 148 PA -- 29.1% walk rate) and has a batting average on balls in play of .418. Remember that \"normal\" or \"average\" is .300, so, one could make the case that he's gotten very lucky on batted balls. On the other hand, the Rockies' third baseman is crushing the ball, with a 93.8 mph average exit velocity that's in the top 4% of the league and gives him a Hard Hit rate of 59.5% (top 1%). Only Juan Soto (60.9%) and Shohei Ohtani (61.5%) have hit the ball harder more consistently this season. So.\n\nElias Diaz: The 33-year old catcher was Colorado's All-Star representative last year with a .763 OPS in the first half of 2023. He hit .255/.299/.375 the rest of the way (221 PA), but in a sign that it was more fatigue than aging curve decline, he's off to a good start to this season, hitting .308/.356/.421 in 118 PA. In his last 55 PA, he's at .306/.364/.469 with a home run, 5 doubles, and a 3-8 BB-K. His blocking doesn't measure well on Statcast, but he's 100th percentile in caught stealing, 96th percentile in pitch framing, and 83rd in pop time. He can control the running game.\n\nEzequiel Tovar: The Rockies gave him one of their patented \"Hmm?\" long-term extensions in the offseason which the 22-year old shortstop responded with a hot start to this season: .306/.363/.486 (.849 OPS) through his first 19 games. In his last 12 (54 PA), he's at .157/.189/.196 (.385 OPS), just 8 for his last 51, with 18 strikeouts against just 2 walks. His Gold Glove caliber defense hasn't exactly slumped to start the year, but he hasn't been quite as spectacular. If that starts happening in this series, it could get annoying in a hurry.\n\nThe starting pitchers: This is a combination of rookie starters (and, no, Hicks isn't a rookie or even a rookie starter, but he's new enough) and a tough park for pitchers that doesn't immediately strike me as a huge problem. Yes, Kyle Harrison is homer prone, so he's more than likely to give up a couple. On the other hand, he, like Jordan Hicks and Keaton Winn, have pitch arsenals that could very well work for the park and at their best they don't walk hitters, which makes pitching in Coors even easier. On the other hand, both Hicks and Winn will be coming off getting beaten up pretty good in a hitter-friendly park... but that's why they're ones to watch. As the starters go, so go the Giants.\n\nBlake Sabol: Wilmer Flores, Matt Chapman, and others have had great track records in Coors Field, but just in terms of a random guy who might take advantage, I'm suggesting we keep an eye on this Blake Sabol fellow. Last season, he went 2-for-7 with a double and 4 walks against just two strikeouts. We know Sabol has big power but strikes out a lot. The Rockies, though, have the lowest strikeout rate in the league, with a 6.68 K/9.", "source": {"uri": "mccoveychronicles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McCovey Chronicles"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He had yet to pitch at Coors Field, a hitter's heaven to many and a pitcher's nightmare to most. Not to Harrison.\n\nThe young left-hander owned the Rockies' offense, pitching a career-high seven shutout innings. Tuesday marked Harrison's second start without giving up an earned run in 2024, and the second time in his career.\n\nRyan Walker struck out the side in his one inning of relief, and Camilo Doval flirted with torture but ultimately escaped a scoreless ninth inning.\n\nHarrison wasn't the only Giant to play at Coors Field for the first time. Jung Hoo Lee made the most of his experience, going 3-for-5 at the plate. Defensively, Lee tracked down a 398-foot shot to center field, jumping at the wall and snagging a fly ball that had a .720 expected batting average.\n\nThe Giants' five runs were their most in a game since April 23, a two-week span that lasted 12 games.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Giants improving to 2-6 on their current 10-game road trip.\n\nPlenty of pitchers would rather use a sick day and stay at home instead of toe the rubber at Coors Field. Harrison is different. The Giants' 22-year-old left-hander is built for success in Colorado.\n\nHarrison isn't someone who relies on the movement of his off-speed pitches, but instead is a fastball-first pitcher, meaning the altitude shouldn't be as much of an issue for him. Coming into Tuesday, Harrison threw his four-seam fastball over 65 percent of the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harrison threw his fastball 48 times - 56 percent of his 86 total pitches. Though the Rockies only swung and missed on three fastballs, Harrison worked quick and efficiently all night long. Harrison faced 27 batters, striking out two while forcing 11 groundouts and six flyouts.\n\nPlus, he was in full control of the game. Harrison walked five batters in his last start and walked just two Tuesday.\n\nWhile Harrison needed only eight pitches to record three outs in the third inning, Rockies starter Dakota Hudson needed 30. The Giants worked Hudson for 18 pitches in the first inning, including a six-pitch walk from LaMonte Wade Jr. They made Hudson start sweating even more in the second inning, one where he threw 22 pitches.\n\nBetween the second and third innings, Hudson threw 52 pitches, but the Giants still were without a run on the board. That finally changed in the fourth inning, when the Giants knocked Hudson out of the game for good.\n\nThe first three batters of the inning saw 13 pitches before Nick Ahmed came to the plate and brought in the Giants' first run on a ball that traveled two feet. Ahmed's RBI single was the sixth pitch of his at-bat.\n\nLee followed Ahmed's infield single with one of his own, traveling four feet. The next batter, Thairo Estrada, was Hudson's last. Estrada's fielder's choice was Hudson's 21st pitch of the fourth inning and his 95th on the day. Hudson tied a season-high of five walks, allowing five hits and four earned runs in 3 2/3 innings.\n\nTy Blach isn't the flashiest. The lefty doesn't throw the hardest. He isn't always going to pass the eye test. And still, coaches and teammates always have relied on him.\n\nRockies manager Bud Black turned to Blach to replace Hudson in the fourth inning against the team Blach spent his first three-plus years in the big leagues with.\n\nWade introduced Blach to the game by hitting a rope of a single to center field, driving in Ahmed and Lee.\n\nBlach then enjoyed two straight 1-2-3 innings before the heart of the order got to him in the seventh. The Giants tagged him for two singles, walked once and scored one run off him in the inning before Black replaced Blach with two outs and the bases loaded.\n\nBlach allowed one earned run on four hits, one walk and two strikeouts in three innings out of the bullpen. He now has allowed nine earned runs in five games, 14 2/3 innings, against the Giants in his career.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Bay Area & California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Doval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camilo Doval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ground out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dakota Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Blach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Blach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMonte_Wade_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LaMonte Wade Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Estrada_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Estrada (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2024/05/kyle-harrison-GettyImages-2151426128.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 1118, "textEnd": 1126}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

That's not new or unique. What is new is that Colorado can't hit and can't score. The Rockies' 5-0 loss to the Giants on Tuesday was their sixth shutout loss of the season.\n\nIt's only May 8, and the season has encompassed just 35 games. There are 127 left to go. Six shutout losses in 35 games is close to one shutout loss every six games. The Rockies are on pace to absorb 27 shutout losses this season. That's nuts. We're not even including another Coors Field home game in which the Rockies didn't score in nine full innings. They were blanked by the Seattle Mariners in nine innings but scored twice in the 10th to win. Their offense has been spectacularly bad. Past Rockie teams would have bad pitching, but they could still hit. This team can't hit, period. It will be fascinating to see if the offensive struggles continue at an improbably severe rate, or if the Rockies finally heat up when the weather also warms up. The offense waking up will be the difference between Colorado being a moderately bad team and -- on the other hand -- a total disaster (a 100-loss team) in 2024.\n\nTV: NBC Sports Bay Area (Giants) / MLB (Rockies) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nThe Giants had just been drubbed by the Philadelphia Phillies over the weekend in a four-game sweep. San Francisco pitching got roughed up, but the bigger story was how quiet San Francisco's bats were. The Giants aren't unique in that regard, but they are one of several teams which has had a really hard time hitting in the first six weeks of the 2024 MLB season. Tuesday, the Giants got healthier against the Rockies with a 5-0 win. San Francisco has faced a tough schedule so far this season, but Colorado gives San Francisco a much easier opponent and a chance to get healthy. Colorado is one of the few teams in the National League that San Francisco should dominate. The Giants should be able to score even more than the five runs they managed on Tuesday. Given that Colorado's hitting is embarrassingly bad, the Giants would notch an almost-certain victory -- straight up and on the run line -- if they score six or more in this game.\n\nWhy The Rockies Could Cover The Spread\n\nIf you were to make an argument that the Rockies will cover the spread, you would simply say that the Giants do not have a dynamic offense right now, and that Colorado -- after so many bad offensive games in recent days -- is due for a real breakout. The Rockies don't have a good offense, but after being shut out at Coors Field on Tuesday, they are bound to bounce back and show a little professional pride in this game.\n\nFinal Giants-Rockies Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Rockies are awful, and you can make some money by consistently betting against them this year.

That ignited a six-run rally by -- let's double check -- yes, an aggressive Giants squad that failed to score that many runs in any of their previous 14 games.\n\nThis marked only the fourth time this season the Giants (17-21) have won back-to-back games. Thursday's 12:10 p.m. PT start pits the Giants' Keaton Winn (3-4, 4.41) against Cal Quantrill (1-3, 4.31).\n\nThe Giants return to Oracle Park on Friday night for a nine-game homestand, with three-game sets against the Cincinnati Reds, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Rockies.\n\nThe Rockies fell to a MLB-worst 8-28 with their ninth loss in their past 10 games; they've been swept in four previous series this season.\n\nWednesday's six-run rally matched their most runs in an inning since a March 30 win San Diego, in their third game of the season.\n\nAfter Conforto turned on an inside fastball for sixth home run of the season (and first in 13 games), the Giants got three consecutive singles, from Matt Chapman, Mike Yastrzemski and Heliot Ramos, the latter of whom got called up from Triple-A Sacramento for not just his season debut but his initiation to hitter-friendly Coors Field.\n\nRamos' opposite-field, RBI single scored Chapman for a 2-0 lead. Showing off the hitting prowess that had him batting .296 with eight home runs and 21 RBI in Sacramento, Ramos fell behind 0-2 in his initial at-bat in Colorado, then he fouled off a 1-2 fastball before lining a 94.2-mph sinker to right field.\n\nRamos served as the designated hitter as the Giants placed slumping slugger Jorge Soler on the 10-day Injury List with a shoulder strain. Ramos had hit just .158 in big-league cameos the past two seasons covering 34 games.\n\nThe Giants' lead climbed to 3-0 when Yastrzemski dove head-first to safely score on Nick Ahmed's surprising, one-out bunt. Jung Hoo Lee made it 4-0 by drilling a slider 105 mph off the right-field wall and driving in Ramos. A two-out, two-RBI flare by LaMonte Wade Jr. pushed the Giants' lead to 6-0, and Conforto followed with a single for his second hit of the inning, before Chapman flew out to end the long-sought rally.\n\nAnother run came the next inning, when a Blake Sabol double scored Ystrzemski for a 7-1 lead.\n\nThat proved a wide enough berth to improve Giants starter Jordan Hicks' record to 3-1.\n\nThe first hit Hicks allowed was a 420-foot triple to Brenton Doyle off the center-field wall, on an 0-2, two-out fastball in the bottom of the second; Doyle would score on a passed ball charged to catcher Blake Sabol, for a 6-1 deficit.\n\nHicks did his share to protect that lead, though he had to work out of jams. Back-to-back strikeouts stranded two Rockies in the fourth, and after Colorado scratched across two runs in the fifth, Hicks induced an inning-ending double play. That ended his night (three runs, seven hits, five strikeouts, two walks in 92 pitches).\n\nReliever Sean Hjelle yielded two hits to the four batters he faced before Taylor Rogers allowed an RBI single to Charlie Blackmon, cutting the Giants' lead to 7-4 through six innings. The Giants took an 8-4 lead in the eighth, when Chapman's infield single prompted an errant throw to bring in Conforto, who reached on a nine-pitch, two-out walk.\n\nGiants closer Camilo Duval walked the first two batters he faced in the ninth. Then he induced a double-play grounder, and that involved him rushing over to cover first base for the second out. But Duval's next pitch resulted in an Ellias Diaz home run, cutting the Giants' lead to 8-6. That's as close as Colorado could get, as Duval got Brendan Rogers to ground out to Nick Ahmed to end it.\n\nConforto finished 3-for-4 with a walk and two runs scored. Sabol went 3-for-4 with an RBI double. Yasztrzemski was 2-for-4 with a triple and two runs scored.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cam_inman@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Cam Inman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

An impasse that made a date with the eight-win Colorado Rockies somehow feel more like a haunted house than an opportunity. Their formula, while not necessarily intentional, has been clear: pitch and defend so damn well that the tiny shred of offense the hitters can provide is enough to win.\n\nThat's how they've won their games -- almost all their games. There have been 148 instances this season where a team has allowed four or more runs and won the game. The Giants are responsible for one of those 148 instances.\n\nThat is the formula. Pitch damn well. Defend damn well. And assume the offense will trip in the batter's box, fall into a pitch, and repeat that over and over until they score a meager number of runs, which will hopefully be enough.\n\nIt's won them some games. But it has virtually no margin for error. When the pitching hiccups, the Giants lose. When the defense hiccups, the Giants lose. When the umpires hiccup, the Giants lose. When I hiccup, the Giants lose.\n\nSo the Rockies -- or, more specifically, Coors Field -- represented a daunting challenge on an already failed road trip. The Giants are at that magnificently grimy place where a hitter's ballpark instills you with the knowledge that the pitching will not be able to hold up, while affording no such confidence for improvement with the bats.\n\nI remember distinctly when I had the realization that I lacked the proper mental coding to be a successful athlete. It was a high school basketball game, and my teammate was shooting a free throw. I was lined up for a potential rebound, the rules stating I must cede pole position to the other team. How in the hell could I ever get the rebound when I'm starting behind this guy, I remember thinking. A few possessions later I was lined up for a free throw rebound again, this time given the inside track as the other team shot. How in the hell could I ever get the rebound when this guy behind me can just go around me, I thought.\n\nWhen you're struggling in sports, be it for a month (like the Giants) or a lifetime (like myself), everything turns into a game of heads you win, tails I lose. How could one possibly expect the Giants pitchers, talented as they may be, to limit runs at Coors Field, where even an A-Ball team would run wild? And how could one possibly expect the Giants hitters, feckless as they are, to score, ballpark be damned?\n\nThe latter part of that confidence-less prophecy did appear valid for the first act of Tuesday's game. The Giants quickly banked a leadoff runner which, it might shock you to learn, is actually something they do exceedingly well. It's the stuff that follows where things get sticky.\n\nLife imitates art, or vice versa, and so Jung Hoo Lee singled in his first Coors Field foray, and was quickly wiped away by a Thairo Estrada double play. LaMonte Wade Jr. then drew a two-out walk but alas, you've seen his film many times before.\n\nAnd in the second, Mike Yastrzemski bopped a one-out double -- I say bopped because it was a glorious, semi-routine pop-up, in which the Rockies learned that the double negative thing that our parents and English teachers warned us about was a fear-tactic myth. Two players not catching a ball is still just a not-caught ball.\n\nAfter Matt Chapman ground out, something he does painfully well, Blake Sabol gave the Giants another two-out walk. Another two-out walk they would squander.\n\nAnd in the third, after two meager outs were recorded, Wade drew yet another two-out walk, and then Michael Conforto followed that lead. Wilmer Flores would then ground out.\n\nThrough three innings, the Giants had two hits, four walks, and no runs. It was a fully-authentic Giants Experience\u2122, but there was a silver lining to accompany the frustration: they'd forced Dakota Hudson to throw 73 pitches in those three innings.\n\nAnd in the bottom halves of the innings, Kyle Harrison was rendering the other portion of the prophecy obsolete. His first dance with Coors Field was going swimmingly. Sure, walks were his kryptonite in the Minors, and you can't have those in Denver. And yes, home runs have been his Achilles heel in the Majors, and Dinger the mascot demands at least three of those as payment to visit his field.\n\nBut Harrison didn't care. Through that first three-inning act, Harrison had allowed half as many baserunners as Hudson ... and thrown 34 fewer pitches.\n\nStill, it had all the workings and trappings of another frustrating Giants loss. We've all seen the Giants offense face someone with a 5.93 ERA, as Hudson wore into battle, and we've all seen them stack hit upon walk upon hit against said pitcher, while the pitch count swells, and yet they never break through with a run. And we've all seen the Giants talented corps of pitchers, as Mason Black bore witness to in his debut on Monday, pitch very well, only for Bob Melvin to inform them that greatness is required.\n\nIt was with hesitancy that I wrote on Twitter that Hudson had thrown 73 pitches and Harrison 39. Coors Field is merciless. Hudson would gut and grind his way through five innings on 110 pitches, somehow holding the Giants scoreless, and let his mediocre-on-a-good-day bullpen finish the job. Harrison would be excellent until he wasn't, and then that would be that.\n\nThe cruelty of a 162-game season is that negative trends develop and you're stuck with them. It's the worst season of your favorite show and you have to watch every episode, and then you have to watch the reruns twice until the next season is released.\n\nBut the beauty of a 162-game season is that sometimes you buck those trends, maybe for a day, maybe for a week, or maybe for so long that you learn the trends were never trends at all, just randomly dispersed pellets of disappointment, designed to make your pessimistic tendencies shiver with anticipation.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the Giants bucked those trends. Specifically, Harrison bucked those trends. He got through the fourth inning on seven pitches, working around a one-out single by Brendan Rodgers, who never reached second. He set down the side in order in the fifth inning. He needed 13 pitches to get through the sixth inning, again not allowing a one-out single (this time Ryan McMahon) to advance a bag. He walked Jacob Stallings with one out in the seventh inning but, like those fallen Rockies before him, Stallings would never know the splendors of second base.\n\nHis night was done after seven splendid innings, in which he'd allowed a mere four hits -- all singles -- and two walks. One of the great strikeout pitchers in recent Minor League history, Harrison once again reminded that he's so much more, keeping the Rockies fully at bay with just two punchouts. With just 86 pitches required, Harrison might have dabbled in attempting his first complete game, where it not for Melvin realizing that Harrison has a limited number of innings to offer this year, and just might be the team's co-ace.\n\nIt was the first time since Barry Zito, 12 whole years ago, that a Giants pitcher had dealt at least seven shutout innings at Coors. It was just the second time that any pitcher had done so this year, joining another once-great Giants prospect, Luis Castillo. And for one day, at least, Harrison had made sure that the torturous and obvious storylines the Giants have been rolling out were set aside.\n\nI'd love to tell you the Giants offense bucked the trend so successfully, too. That they put on a hit parade and smashed dingers to every part of the yard. That their run differential was reversed in one night and you suddenly had faith in their offensive production.\n\nBut then again, what actually happened just might be even more comforting. The Giants broke through not with offensive force, but with simplicity, perseverance, and, if we're being honest, luck. But, as long as we're being honest, we must point out that luck has eluded their bats most of the year.\n\nIn the fourth inning, with one out, Chapman drew the team's fifth walk ... but their first with less than two outs. Blake Sabol, who has done an admirable job stepping in for the team's sudden loss of catchers, singled, and Chapman played it perfectly, ending up at third when no one would have blamed him for staying at second.\n\nThe table was set for a team that loves to throw their food on the floor. And up came Ahmed, intent on reminding us of the silliness of this sport. Just two innings prior, Ahmed had hit with two runners on, and lined one straight up the middle at 104.2 mph, with a .750 expected batting average. Rodgers dove and caught the ball to end the inning.\n\nThis time Ahmed hit the ball 82.7 mph, with an expected batting average of .090. McMahon fielded it, had no play at second, and by the time he realized that, had no play at first, either. Any harder and it would have been an inning-ending double play. Instead, it was an infield single, a run scored, and a rally re-ignited.\n\nExactly one pitch later, Lee hit a ball at all of 36.0 mph. A true terror of speed. Again McMahon fielded it, again McMahon realized he had no play but at first, and again McMahon then realized he had no play there, either.\n\nThe bases were loaded, which you, I, and everybody knows is bad news. Bad news when the Giants are pitching, and especially bad news when the Giants are hitting.\n\nExactly one pitch later, Estrada hit a ball at 78.0 mph, with Rodgers learning from McMahon and knowing immediately could only mean success at first. Estrada was retired, but a second run had scored.\n\nTwo runs in a single inning! What sorcery!\n\nAnd they weren't even done. Three soft ground balls on three consecutive pitches spelled he end of the night for Hudson, who surely shook his head wondering how he had gotten so unlucky. How fun it is to be on this side of that act.\n\nIn came old friend Ty Blach and Wade, getting to stay in against a lefty, ripped one right back where it came from for a two-run single.\n\nThe Giants, who had scored four runs exactly once in their last 11 games, had scored four runs in the fourth inning alone. They hadn't done it with a home run, or even an extra-base hit. I almost think it's better this way.\n\nThey added another run in the seventh, when singles by Estrada and Conforto bookmarked a third walk drawn by Wade.\n\nAnd when Harrison traded in his fastball for an inhaler, Ryan Walker emerged to strike out all three batters he faced in the eighth, with Camilo Doval shaking off the cobwebs to handle the ninth.\n\nThe Giants won 5-0. They won because Kyle Harrison dominated, and the rest of the formula fell right into place.", "source": {"uri": "mccoveychronicles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McCovey Chronicles"}, "authors":

He had yet to pitch at Coors Field, a hitter's heaven to many and a pitcher's nightmare to most. Not to Harrison.\n\nThe young left-hander owned the Rockies' offense, pitching a career-high seven shutout innings. Tuesday marked Harrison's second start without giving up an earned run in 2024, and the second time in his career.\n\nRyan Walker struck out the side in his one inning of relief, and Camilo Doval flirted with torture but ultimately escaped a scoreless ninth inning.\n\nHarrison wasn't the only Giant to play at Coors Field for the first time. Jung Hoo Lee made the most of his experience, going 3-for-5 at the plate. Defensively, Lee tracked down a 398-foot shot to center field, jumping at the wall and snagging a fly ball that had a .720 expected batting average.\n\nThe Giants' five runs were their most in a game since April 23, a two-week span that lasted 12 games.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Giants improving to 2-6 on their current 10-game road trip.\n\nPlenty of pitchers would rather use a sick day and stay at home instead of toe the rubber at Coors Field. Harrison is different. The Giants' 22-year-old left-hander is built for success in Colorado.\n\nHarrison isn't someone who relies on the movement of his off-speed pitches, but instead is a fastball-first pitcher, meaning the altitude shouldn't be as much of an issue for him. Coming into Tuesday, Harrison threw his four-seam fastball over 65 percent of the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harrison threw his fastball 48 times - 56 percent of his 86 total pitches. Though the Rockies only swung and missed on three fastballs, Harrison worked quick and efficiently all night long. Harrison faced 27 batters, striking out two while forcing 11 groundouts and six flyouts.\n\nPlus, he was in full control of the game. Harrison walked five batters in his last start and walked just two Tuesday.\n\nWhile Harrison needed only eight pitches to record three outs in the third inning, Rockies starter Dakota Hudson needed 30. The Giants worked Hudson for 18 pitches in the first inning, including a six-pitch walk from LaMonte Wade Jr. They made Hudson start sweating even more in the second inning, one where he threw 22 pitches.\n\nBetween the second and third innings, Hudson threw 52 pitches, but the Giants still were without a run on the board. That finally changed in the fourth inning, when the Giants knocked Hudson out of the game for good.\n\nThe first three batters of the inning saw 13 pitches before Nick Ahmed came to the plate and brought in the Giants' first run on a ball that traveled two feet. Ahmed's RBI single was the sixth pitch of his at-bat.\n\nLee followed Ahmed's infield single with one of his own, traveling four feet. The next batter, Thairo Estrada, was Hudson's last. Estrada's fielder's choice was Hudson's 21st pitch of the fourth inning and his 95th on the day. Hudson tied a season-high of five walks, allowing five hits and four earned runs in 3 2/3 innings.\n\nTy Blach isn't the flashiest. The lefty doesn't throw the hardest. He isn't always going to pass the eye test. And still, coaches and teammates always have relied on him.\n\nRockies manager Bud Black turned to Blach to replace Hudson in the fourth inning against the team Blach spent his first three-plus years in the big leagues with.\n\nWade introduced Blach to the game by hitting a rope of a single to center field, driving in Ahmed and Lee.\n\nBlach then enjoyed two straight 1-2-3 innings before the heart of the order got to him in the seventh. The Giants tagged him for two singles, walked once and scored one run off him in the inning before Black replaced Blach with two outs and the bases loaded.\n\nBlach allowed one earned run on four hits, one walk and two strikeouts in three innings out of the bullpen. He now has allowed nine earned runs in five games, 14 2/3 innings, against the Giants in his career.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Doval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camilo Doval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ground out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dakota Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Blach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Blach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMonte_Wade_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LaMonte Wade Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thairo_Estrada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thairo Estrada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Estrada_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Estrada (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/2a507ac959d4b3ce8f2aebf03b4eea0f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 1058, "textEnd": 1066}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He gave up just six baserunners -- two walks and four hits -- and has now allowed just one earned run in his past 18 innings pitched.\n\nLaMonte Wade Jr., by far the Giants' most productive hitter this year, drove in two runs with a single and walked three more times, reaching base in all of his plate appearances. He's now hitting .351 and leads Major League Baseball with a .485 on-base percentage.\n\nBehind Harrison and Wade, the Giants (16-21) snapped their four-game losing streak with a 5-0 victory.\n\nThe Giants broke out with four runs in the fourth inning -- not by hitting the ball hard, but by placing hits where the Colorado defense. Finally, San Francisco caught some breaks.\n\nConsecutive swinging bunts from Nick Ahmed and Jung Hoo Lee (exit velocities of 82.7 and 36 mph) put the Giants on the board and then loaded the bases. A chopper up the middle from Thairo Estrada plated another, before LaMonte Wade Jr. drove in two more with a line drive.\n\nBob Melvin elected to keep Wade in the game in a left-on-left matchup against former Giant Ty Blach. Wade hasn't gotten many opportunities to prove himself against southpaws in the past few years, but certainly hasn't looked overmatched in a limited sample. Last year, he posted a .709 OPS in 81 plate appearances against lefties.\n\nWade's single gave the Giants a 4-0 lead. It wasn't exactly an offensive breakout, but their four runs in the fourth inning were as many as the Giants have had in any entire game since April 23.\n\nEarlier in the night, the Giants couldn't find the big hit to break open the game. They put six runners on in the first three innings, but stranded them all.\n\nHarrison bought San Francisco's offense time. He filled up the strike zone and worked efficiently, cruising through an overmatched Rockies lineup. He relied on his four-seam fastball, often at the rail, more than half the time.\n\nIn the seventh inning, Wade walked for a third time and Michael Conforto singled to give the Giants a 5-0 lead. After their offensive ineptitude in Philadelphia led to a team meeting and a visibly peeved manager, a five-run performance was much-needed.\n\nHarrison needed just 71 pitches to get through six scoreless innings in the hitter-friendly environment.

Ryan McMahon shot a splitter into right field at 110.7 mph. Winn went back to the sinker, and Elias D\u00edaz drove a double at 106.5 mph off the bat. Sean Bouchard sent a slider screaming past Wilmer Flores, and singled on a splitter, setting the stage for Benton Doyle to end the assault with a 430-foot missile to make it 6-1.\n\nWinn was tagged for seven runs on eight hits in 3\u2154 innings, raising his ERA to 5.63.\n\nAfter limiting opponents to five earned runs over 23 in his previous four starts (a 1.93 ERA), Winn has combined to allow 12 over only 4\u2153 innings his past two -- one more out recorded than runs allowed.\n\nThe Giants didn't use one lineup more than four times all of last season, but almost a third of the way into 2024 have already used their most common batting order eight times. With a cavalcade of injuries, a getaway game at Coors Field and still no day off in sight, this was not one of those days.\n\nAlready missing Jorge Soler (shoulder), Patrick Bailey (concussion) and Tom Murphy (knee), the Giants took another blow when Jung Hoo Lee fouled a pitch off his toe Wednesday, knocking him out of the lineup for the series finale.\n\nMaking matters worse, Nick Ahmed was forced from the game midway through with left wrist discomfort, forcing Tyler Fitzgerald to take over at shortstop. They were already without Matt Chapman, who received a day off after snapping an 0-for-12 skid Wednesday.\n\nSome combination of playing shorthanded and Cal Quantrill, the Rockies' starter, halted whatever momentum the Giants' beleaguered offense had built in the first two games of the series.\n\nAfter breaking out for 13 runs the past two games -- more than they had in their previous five -- the Giants were limited to a lone run by Quantrill and a trio of Rockies relievers. Their only offense was provided by a home run that Michael Conforto snuck over the fence just inside the left-field foul pole, his team-leading seventh of the season.\n\nThe Giants (17-22) return home from their longest road trip of the season four games further under .500 and four games further out of first place than they were went they left San Francisco.\n\nThey are closer in the standings to the last-place Rockies (9-28) than they are the first-place Dodgers (26-13), whom they welcome to Oracle Park starting Monday for the first of only two series this season between the rivals on the shores of McCovey Cove.\n\nSomething else the Giants share in common with the Rockies: the only two teams yet to sweep a series this season.\n\nThey went 3-7 over the 10-game trip and were outscored 54-30, failing to push more than three men across the plate in seven of those contests. While the first stretch came against the Red Sox (19-18) and the Phillies (26-12), two good teams that lead their respective leagues in ERA, Thursday's loss to the lowly Rockies too closely resembled the start of the trip than their better-look past two games.\n\nSet to return home Friday, the Giants have three games against the Reds (16-21) to get right before their archrivals come to town.",

He allowed just six baserunners -- two walks and four hits -- and has now given up one earned run in his past 18 innings pitched.\n\nLaMonte Wade Jr., by far the Giants' most productive hitter this year, drove in two runs with a single and walked three more times, reaching base in all of his plate appearances. He's now hitting .351 and leads Major League Baseball with a .485 on-base percentage.\n\nBehind Harrison and Wade, the Giants (16-21) snapped their four-game losing streak with a 5-0 victory.\n\nThe Giants broke out with four runs in the fourth inning. Finally, San Francisco caught some breaks.\n\nConsecutive swinging bunts from Nick Ahmed and Jung Hoo Lee (exit velocities of 82.7 and 36 mph) put the Giants on the board and then loaded the bases. A chopper up the middle from Thairo Estrada plated another, before Wade drove in two more with a line drive.\n\nBob Melvin elected to keep Wade in the game in a left-on-left matchup against former Giant Ty Blach. Wade hasn't gotten many opportunities to prove himself against southpaws in the past few years, but certainly hasn't looked overmatched in a limited sample. Last year, he posted a .709 OPS in 81 plate appearances against lefties.\n\nWade's single gave the Giants a 4-0 lead. It wasn't exactly an offensive breakout, but their four runs in the fourth inning were as many as the Giants have had in any entire game since April 23.\n\nEarlier in the night, the Giants couldn't find the big hit to break open the game. They put six runners on in the first three innings, but stranded them all.\n\nHarrison bought San Francisco's offense time. He filled up the strike zone and worked efficiently, cruising through an overmatched Rockies lineup. He relied on his four-seam fastball, often at the rail, more than half the time.\n\nIn the seventh inning, Wade walked for a third time and Michael Conforto singled to give the Giants a 5-0 lead. After their offensive ineptitude in Philadelphia led to a team meeting and a visibly peeved manager, a five-run performance was much-needed.\n\nHarrison needed just 71 pitches to get through six scoreless innings in the hitter-friendly environment. He got some oxygen in the dugout before heading out for the bottom of the seventh, which he finished in 15 deliveries.\n\nThe shutout lowered Harrison's ERA to 3.20 on the season -- a mark that closely resembles the Giants' runs per game average over the past few weeks. Two more games in altitude could make a big difference there.\n\n\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc. Visit at mercurynews.com.

The Rockies now own the worst record in the majors. Yep, even worse than the 9-28 White Sox.\n\nAnd yep, starter Peter Lambert was rocked hard in his brief outing.\n\nBut there were a few glimmers of purple-tinted promise amid the wreckage:\n\n* Catcher Elias Diaz hit a two-run homer off Camilo Doval in the ninth to make the Giants nervous.\n\n* Right-hander Anthony Molina, the Rule-5 draft pickup, relieved Lambert and flashed some of the talent that intrigued the Rockies during the offseason when they picked off the Tampa Bay roster. The 22-year-old allowed one unearned run and struck out three in his 3 2/3 innings. After a disastrous start to his Rockies career, he's allowed no earned runs over his last five outings.\n\n\"I think it's about comfort, first of all, and confidence and a little momentum now,\" manager Bud Black said of Molina. \"The fastball has ticked up, maybe a little bit, and the location has gotten better. The feel for the changeup has been apparent and a real positive. We've talked about the breaking ball improvement. That's there, too.\"\n\n* Rookie left fielder Jordan Beck, who struggled mightily after getting two hits in his big-league debut on April 30, delivered a double in Colorado's two-run fifth inning to end an 0-for-13 skid. He also singled in the sixth.\n\n* Speedy center fielder Brenton Doyle, last year's Gold Glove winner as a rookie, broke out of an 0-for-11 slump with a two-out triple in the second inning and scored easily on a wild pitch by Giants starter Jordan Hicks.\n\n* Sean Bouchard, who began the season at Triple-A, started again in right field, hit 3 for 4 with singles in the second and sixth and a double off the right-field wall in the eighth.\n\n* And although he's far from being a kid, 37-year-old Charlie Blackmon busted out of his own funk with a 2-for-4 night that included two RBIs and a walk. With his two RBIs, Blackmon has driven in 760 runs, tying him with former Rockie Nolan Arenado for fourth in franchise history.\n\nStill, beneath the sugarcoating is the reality that Colorado clinched another series loss by losing the first two games to San Francisco and remains the only team this season without a series victory.\n\nThey are also the only team yet to win back-to-back games this season. They have now gone 36 games without winning consecutive games, the longest streak in franchise history.\n\nLambert, whose hold on his spot in the rotation is tenuous, retired the Giants in order in the first inning, but the Giants battered Lambert for six runs on seven hits in the second, sending 11 men to the plate. Michael Conforto began the Giants' hit parade with a solo home run to right. Included in the onslaught was a perfect bunt by Nick Ahmed to score Mike Yastrzemski from third.\n\nAsked to explain what happened in the second inning, Lambert answered, \"To be honest, I don't really know. It just kind of turned pretty quickly. I thought I made some pretty good pitches and some bad pitches, obviously. They seemed to put the bat on the ball on some good pitches.\"\n\nThe Giants added another run off Lambert in the third, combining Yastrzemski's leadoff triple with Blake Sabol's double. Lambert's ERA rose from 5.66 to 7.61 after he gave up seven runs on nine hits over three innings. It was the most runs he's allowed since giving up a career-high nine on Aug. 7, 2019, at Houston.", "source": {"uri": "reporterherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Loveland Reporter-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_saunders@reporterherald.com", "name": "Patrick Saunders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Doval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camilo Doval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lambert_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Lambert (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pickoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bouchard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean Bouchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breaking ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Yastrzemski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Yastrzemski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Conforto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Conforto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.reporterherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-L-SPBBNROCKIES-0509-02.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1343, "textEnd": 1351}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-07", "textStart": 3493, "textEnd": 3505}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The Giants have won 24 of the last 33 games against the National League West rivals. Facing the Rockies might be what they need after getting swept in Philadelphia.\n\n\"It's still early, but it's time to start having a little bit more urgency,\" said the Giants' LaMonte Wade Jr., who had three walks on Tuesday night. \"I feel like everybody's working hard. Everybody wants to compete. I don't think anybody's not competing. We just need to translate it to the game, and it's a hard thing to do. This is a hard game. It's a long season, though.

The Rockies have trailed in 34 of their 35 games this season and have yet to win consecutive games.\n\nTwo of the few bright spots have been the bats of Ryan McMahon and catcher Jacob Stallings, both of whom are hitting above .300. Stallings can give perspective to his new teammates from his two seasons in Miami.\n\n\"My first year, we lost a lot of close games, and then the next year, we won a lot of close games,\" said Stallings, who played for the Marlins from 2022-23. \"Sometimes all it takes is getting the confidence that we're going to win. We're fighting it right now.\"\n\nColorado has been shut out six times this season and twice in the last three games. It gives the pitching staff little room for error, which means Lambert needs to improve on his past performances against San Francisco.\n\nIn five career appearances -- four starts -- against the Giants, he is 0-1 with a 6.95 ERA and struggled against them last season, his first full year since Tommy John surgery in 2020. Lambert had one start and one relief appearance against San Francisco in 2023, giving up nine runs over 6 1/3 innings.\n\nLambert struggled in his last outing, a 5-4 loss at Miami on Thursday in which he allowed four runs in 3 1/3 innings.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lambert_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Lambert (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMonte_Wade_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LaMonte Wade Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McMahon (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes, playing an eight-win in-division opponent is exactly what a team needs.\n\nThe Giants batted around the order - plus more - in the second inning, giving them all the cushion they needed. Those six runs proved to be more important as the game went on.\n\nJordan Hicks for the second straight start didn't exactly have his best stuff. Hicks only made it through four innings in his last outing and was fortunate to make it through five innings this time. The Rockies scored two runs in the bottom of the fifth while sending seven batters to the plate.\n\nBut Hicks also induced an inning-ending double play as Brendan Rodgers left the bases loaded. Again, that second inning made all the difference. Hicks in five innings gave up three earned runs on seven hits, two walks and struck out five.\n\nThairo Estrada (0-for-4, two walks) and Nick Ahmed (0-for-3, one run, one RBI) were the only Giants who didn't record a hit. Four Giants had a multi-hit game.\n\nWednesday's win gave the Giants their first series win of this 10-game road trip, and marked their first back-to-back wins since April 22 and 23.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Giants improving to 17-21 on the season.\n\nThe Giants hadn't scored six or more runs in a game since April 20, and had done so five times the entire 2024 MLB season. Then the second inning happened Wednesday at Coors Field.\n\nIn the second inning alone, the Giants scored six runs. They recorded seven hits and 11 batters came to the plate before starting pitcher Peter Lambert could record three outs. Lambert needed only 11 pitches to get through a 1-2-3 first inning, and then threw 36 pitching in the second.\n\nMichael Conforto was the MVP of the inning, leading it off with a solo shot 387 feet over the right-field wall, and also singling later in the inning too.\n\nFrom slugging to small ball, the Giants scored in an array of ways during the second inning. Ahmed and Jung Hoo Lee were perfect examples of how. First, Ahmed squared around for a perfect bunt to score Mike Yastrzemski on a head-first Superman slide.\n\nNext up, Lee crushed a liner 104.6 mph off the right-field wall for a double to score Heliot Ramos.\n\nRamos has done everything right in Triple-A Sacramento this season after struggling in spring training. A logjam in the outfield and at DH has kept him from the big leagues in 2024, until Wednesday when Jorge Soler was placed on the 10-day injured list with a strained right shoulder. The first ball Ramos put in play had a 62.7-mph exit velocity, and his process was as important as the result.\n\nThe 24-year-old fouled off a 95-mph sinker inside on a 1-2 count, the fourth pitch of his first at-bat. Lambert then tried to throw another sinker inside on Ramos, this time out of the strike zone. But Ramos was able to stay inside and bloop an RBI single into right field.\n\nThough Ramos struck out swinging his next at-bat, he worked a 3-2 count and made Lambert work for eight pitches. Ramos then swung at the first pitch his third time up and was the victim of some bad luck, scorching a grounder 104.7 mph to shortstop for the third out of the fifth inning.\n\nHe struck out looking in his fourth and final at-bat of the night, ending 1-for-4 with one RBI and two strikeouts.\n\nManager Bob Melvin found himself in the worst possible situation the last time Hicks took the mound five days ago, but not because of the right-hander's up-and-down performance. The nightmare was from catcher Patrick Bailey sustaining a concussion from a foul ball off his mask early in the game. His backup, Tom Murphy, then was on the wrong side of a wet field, sustaining a knee injury that will keep him out multiple weeks.\n\nEnter Blake Sabol.\n\nThe versatile 26-year-old played 110 games for the Giants last season, but was another name stuck in Sacramento early this season. Next man up, right? That appears to be Sabol's mindset, taking advantage of his latest opportunity.\n\nSabol enjoyed his second career three-hit game Wednesday, going 3-for-4 with an RBI double and two singles. In four games since being called up due to injuries, Sabol now is batting .500 (6-for-12). Sabol sprayed the ball all over Coors Field and has to feel confident entering the final game of a three-game series in Colorado before coming home for nine games.", "source": {"uri":

There have been 148 instances this season where a team has allowed four or more runs and won the game. The Giants are responsible for one of those 148 instances.\n\nThat is the formula. Pitch damn well. Defend damn well. And assume the offense will trip in the batter's box, fall into a pitch, and repeat that over and over until they score a meager number of runs, which will hopefully be enough.\n\nOn Wednesday that number grew from 148 to 156 thanks to the Yankees beating the Astros 9-5, the Orioles beating the Nationals 7-6, the A's beating the Rangers 9-4, the Rangers returning favor and beating the A's 12-11, the Royals beating the Brewers 6-4, the Guardians beating the Tigers 5-4, the Angels beating the Pirates 5-4 ... and yes, the Giants beating the Rockies 8-6.\n\nThis is what we in the biz refer to as \"taking one for the team.\" You think the broadcaster's jinx is specific to on-air commentary that leads to negative outcomes, but no, no, no. Sometimes it's a positive jinx from a lowly writer. I knew what I was doing when I pointed out that the Giants cannot win by scoring a lot of runs. I couldn't take it anymore. I'm not supposed to impact the outcome but damn it, I was desperate.\n\nAnd so here we are. The Giants won by scoring enough runs that their pitching and defense didn't need to be great, and then when their pitching and defense weren't great, they still won. What a luxury to have multiple paths to victory that you can take.\n\nIt all took place early, giving you a sharp slap of excitement and optimism before dinner, and a long evening of a dwindling lead and an ascending fear in your tummy. The Giants only waited until the second inning to do some of that newfangled hitting that all the other teams seem to be talking about.\n\nIt began with the antithesis of Tuesday's big-inning rally, with Michael Conforto pouncing on the first pitch that Peter Lambert threw in the inning, sending the ball exactly where the baseball powers that be envisioned when they decided to build a ballpark in a mile-high city.\n\nAnd then, a rally in earnest. A single by Matt Chapman. A single by Mike Yastrzemski. A single by Heliot Ramos, called up just hours earlier.\n\nNow it was 2-0, a score that almost made you not say \"here we go again,\" when Blake Sabol proceeded to strike out looking at a clear strike three with a runner on third.\n\nBut the Giants, thankfully, were not done. A night after scoring a run on a swinging bunt, Nick Ahmed laid down a purposeful one. We've seen, throughout this year, how one little thing can swing something from \"good\" to \"bad,\" or vice versa. An umpire's discretion is the difference between having an eye to be praised with patience to match, and being too passive. The placement of a ground ball is the difference between being a pitch-to-contact arm (said in a happy voice) and being a pitch-to-contact arm (said in a grumpy voice).\n\nAnd so it is that Yastrzemski submitted his nomination for \"Slide of the Year,\" a category I frankly forgot existed at award season. And that was the difference between Ahmed's bunt being brilliant and Ahmed's bunt making you shake your head slowly while enveloped by your palm.\n\nIt was also the difference between 2-0 with two outs and 3-0 with one out, and the Giants took advantage of that difference. Jung Hoo Lee was up next and absolutely torched a ball off the fence, the rare missile worth admiring.\n\nDespite the big run, the Giants would twice fail to get a runner home from third with less than two outs, as Thairo Estrada followed Lee's knock with a pop-out. But, just as was the case the night before, LaMonte Wade Jr. had just the answer for runners at second and third with two outs: a liner up the middle to score a pair.\n\nThe Giants had plated six runs for the first time since April 20 and, miraculously, they'd allowed them all home in the same inning. Perhaps you didn't know that that's allowed, but now you do.\n\nPerhaps you had dreams of a football score gracing your television, but let's not get too crazy. The Giants may have flipped the script, but they're still not going to make winning look easy, and so the slowly opened the door for Colorado to come back in, starting in the bottom half of the inning, when Jordan Hicks ceded a two-out triple to Brenton Doyle, and then allowed him to score on a wild pitch (which perhaps should have been a passed ball).\n\nThe Giants got that run back, courtesy of Yastrzemski leading off the very next inning with a triple of his own, and Sabol doubling him home.\n\nBut the Rockies were unperturbed. They rallied against Hicks in the fifth inning, scoring a pair of runs and loading the bases with just one out, a lone swing away from the game resetting. But Hicks, who on his worst days bends but still doesn't quite break, worked an inning-ending double play to not only shut down the danger, but book himself another number in the win column.\n\nThe Rockies added another run in the sixth off of Sean Hjelle, drawing the game to within three runs, but a rally by Conforto and Chapman and Associates returned the lead to 8-4, where it sat patiently until the ninth inning.\n\nYou weren't surprised that Bob Melvin brought in Camilo Doval in a non-save situation, since it really should be a save situation when you add the Coors Field tax. But you also weren't surprised that Doval played with his food, walking the first two batters. He, like Hicks many innings earlier, then worked a brilliant double play, with help from his defense ... though he was part of that defense.\n\nAnd then, as if to give you a glimpse into what could have been in a more cursed reality, Doval promptly gave up a two-run blast to Elias D\u00edaz.\n\nHe'd give up no more, though, and the Giants would win 8-6 and clinch the series. This isn't how they're designed to win games, but then again, good teams don't stick with any one design.", "source": {"uri": "mccoveychronicles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McCovey

And yep, starter Peter Lambert was rocked hard in his brief outing. But there were a few glimmers of purple-tinted promise amid the wreckage:\n\n* Catcher Elias Diaz hit a two-run homer off Camilo Doval in the ninth to make the Giants nervous.\n\n* Right-hander Anthony Molina, the Rule-5 draft pickup, relieved Lambert and flashed some of the talent that intrigued the Rockies during the offseason. He allowed one unearned run and struck out three in his 3 2/3 innings. After a disastrous start to his Rockies career, he's allowed no earned runs over his last five outings.\n\n* Rookie left fielder Jordan Beck, who struggled mightily after getting two hits in his big-league debut on April 30, delivered a double in Colorado's two-run fifth inning to end an 0-for-13 skid. He also singled in the sixth.\n\n* Speedy center fielder Brenton Doyle, last year's Gold Glove winner as a rookie, broke out of an 0-for-11 slump with a two-out triple in the second inning and scored easily on a wild pitch by Giants starter Jordan Hicks.\n\n* Sean Bouchard, who began the season at Triple-A, started again in right field, hit 3 for 4 with singles in the second and sixth and a double off the right-field wall in the eighth.\n\n* And although he's far from being a kid, 37-year-old Charlie Blackmon busted out of his own funk with a 2-for-4 night that included two RBIs and a walk. With his two RBIs, Blackmon has driven in 760 runs, tying him with former Rockie Nolan Arenado for fourth in franchise history.\n\nStill, beneath the sugarcoating is the reality that Colorado clinched another series loss by losing the first two games to San Francisco and remains the only team this season without a series victory.\n\nThey are also the only team that has yet to win back-to-back games this season. They have now gone 36 games without winning consecutive games, the longest streak in franchise history.\n\nLambert, whose hold on his spot in the rotation is tenuous, retired the Giants in order in the first inning, but the Giants battered Lambert for six runs on seven hits in the second, sending 11 men to the plate. Michael Conforto began the Giants' hit parade with a solo home run to right. Included in the onslaught was a perfect bunt by Nick Ahmed to score Mike Yastrzemski from third.\n\nThe Giants added another run off Lambert in the third, combining Yastrzemski's leadoff triple with Blake Sabol's double. Lambert's ERA rose from 5.66 to 7.61 after he gave up seven runs on nine hits over three innings.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_saunders@denverpost.com", "name": "Patrick Saunders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Doval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camilo Doval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lambert_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Lambert (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bouchard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean Bouchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Yastrzemski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Yastrzemski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Conforto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Conforto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-L-SPBBNROCKIES-0509-02.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 851, "textEnd": 859}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The Giants have won 40 of their last 53 meetings with their NL West rivals.\n\nSan Francisco has received good starting pitching and its offense has produced in the first two games, a trend it hopes continues.\n\nWinn will try to bounce back from his toughest start of the season. He tossed at least five innings in each of his first six outings before lasting just two-thirds of an inning at Philadelphia on Saturday. He yielded five runs on four hits and two walks.\n\nThe 26-year-old Iowa native has faced Colorado twice last year in his debut season, going 1-0 with a 5.40 ERA. One of those outings occurred in Denver.\n\nSan Francisco's offense helped the first two starters in the series despite the absence of Jorge Soler. The slugger landed on the 10-day injured list on Wednesday, retroactive to Sunday, due to a right shoulder strain.\n\n\"It had been like three days since I had played, so the manager and I spoke and the manager felt that it wasn't right to keep asking me (how I felt) every day,\" Soler said through an interpreter. \"So I guess the best course of action for me was to go on the IL and bring somebody else up.\"\n\nHeliot Ramos was that someone else. He was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento on Wednesday to take Soler's roster spot and delivered a hit in his 2024 major league debut on Wednesday. That was one of 13 hits for San Francisco, which had 10 hits on Tuesday.\n\nThe Rockies' offense had been dormant until breaking out with six runs in the Wednesday loss. In the four games prior to that, Colorado scored a total of six runs and was shut out twice.\n\nWednesday was just the second time in 10 games the Rockies scored more than four runs -- and they dropped both of those contests.

And who could blame him.\n\nHarrison had dominated the first seven rounds of his debut fight with Coors Field. Pitchers toe the rubber there to see their ERAs explode and their confidence implode. Harrison used his Coors Field debut Tuesday to show the kind of reliable young arm he can be for the Giants in their much-needed 5-0 win against the Colorado Rockies to snap a four-game skid.\n\nThrough his first 14 career starts - seven last season and seven so far this season - Harrison had yet to be given the ball in Denver. But he actually used his previous experiences in the Pacific Coast League pitching for the Sacramento River Cats to his advantage.\n\n\"I played a lot of minor league games in Salt Lake and Reno and these places where I kind of have no excuse to not show up on this day,\" Harrison said to reporters in Denver after the win. \"I felt great out there. Shape of pitches were fine, honestly, and any time you got two strikeouts, you got a hell of defense behind you.\"\n\nRockies leadoff hitter Brenton Doyle struck out on Harrison's first three pitches of the night, two fastballs and a changeup for a called strike three. Harrison then went 14 batters before his next strikeout, surprising Sean Bouchard with a 94-mph fastball down the middle for the third out of the fourth inning.\n\n\"It's about not going out there and trying to strike somebody out and to get to two strikes,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \"If you can get early-pitch contact and keep your pitch count down, that means you're going to be out there a little longer.\"\n\nIn each of Harrison's last two starts, he had racked up seven strikeouts. Harrison was averaging nearly five-and-a-half strikeouts per start this season, but only two was the perfect dose on the way to him throwing a career-high seven innings.\n\nThe Rockies grounded out 11 times off Harrison and flew out six times.\n\nThe Giants made it a point to improve their defense this season, and flashed the leather on several occasions. Jung Hoo Lee also made his Coors Field debut Tuesday, going 3-for-5 at the plate for his first career three-hit game, and also ran down the two longest hit balls of the day.\n\nFirst, Lee tracked a 398-foot Ezequiel Tovar fly out in the third inning that had a .720 expected batting average and would have been a homer in six MLB ballparks. Then in the fifth, he caught a 391-foot blast at the wall off Jordan Beck's bat that had a .410 expected batting average and would have been gone in 18 parks.\n\nThairo Estrada should consistently find himself in the mix for a Gold Glove, and went high-flying to show why.\n\n\"They made some great plays today,\" Harrison said. \"Estrada was unbelievable at second. Jung Hoo, I could go on about everyone. They were great today.\"\n\nThe biggest difference in Harrison's start Tuesday compared to his last was how he commanded the zone and controlled the game. Yes, Harrison struck out seven Red Sox five days prior. He also walked five. In his previous six starts before facing Boston, Harrison had registered five walks - a sign of major improvements and development from his rookie year.\n\nHis five walks at Fenway Park could have been a precursor for his Coors debut. Reality was the opposite. Harrison totaled 86 pitches and two walks, threw a first-pitch ball to just seven of the 27 batters he faced and allowed his defense to get their jobs done.\n\n\"I think that's always the approach,\" Harrison said. \"And that's something that I've really been trying to do this year is come out and throw strikes and attack these guys. If you're playing at a ballpark like this, you definitely want to attack.\n\n\"You can't have any wasted opportunities.\"\n\nHarrison became the sixth Giants starting pitcher ever to throw seven or more scoreless innings at Coors Field, joining Russ Ortiz, Jason Schmidt, Matt Cain, Tim Lincecum and Barry Zito. Zito was 33 years old, Schmidt was 31, Ortiz was 28, Lincecum was four days from turning 24 and Cain, like Harrison, was 22.\n\nEvery game Harrison has started this season has been after a loss. The Giants now are 6-2 in said games.\n\nThe electricity that emanates from his left arm can turn the stadium lights on throughout most of his starts. But in a hitter's paradise, Harrison shut the lights off on a lowly Rockies offense because of a veteran's mentality well beyond his years, serving as an example of maturity he can lean on as the years go on.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki",

Only one of the hits came against his fastball.\n\nManager Bud Black knows guys like Hicks rarely exist in the minor leagues, if ever. The reliever-turned-starter was another chapter of the team's baptism by fire. And the heat is melting them so far. The lineup produces the 24th-most run value league against fastballs, according to FanGraphs.\n\n\"He's got a good arm, he's got good stuff,\" Black said of Hicks after the loss. \"He went to the fastball late when he needed it but threw a lot of breaking balls. We hung in there on the split finger and the breaker.\"\n\nThe issue's solution is complex and different for each player.\n\nBrenton Doyle and others keep a notebook of details from each of their first times facing a pitcher. Kirby, for example, was a first for the outfielder and many of the Rockies. They knew his fastball was coming, but seeing it in person was a varied experience from video scouting.\n\n\"It can only benefit us to see them, but watching video and being in the box yourself are two completely different things,\" Doyle said. \"There are also certain pitchers who gameplan totally different when they throw here. Sometimes they can't get their slider to move right (at altitude), so they'll move to a changeup, stuff like that.\"\n\nThe problem is made worse by the team's struggles against breaking balls.\n\nColorado's young hitters are still looking to find their footing, and it's one of the league's worst lineups in chase rate against breaking balls.\n\nThe focus has been cutting out the whiffs, and have the club keying on other things. When the high-velocity pitches come, the Rockies have been late -- the balls have been fouled off or missed altogether with a smaller margin for error.\n\n\"A lot of guys have been chasing down and away, so that's in the back of our heads,\" Sean Bouchard said. \"You want to see the off-speed up. But you think about it for that millisecond and it's too late.\"\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nAs the chase rate rose, the momentum did the opposite.\n\nIt wasn't enough to overcome a large deficit when Colorado found some Wednesday. In Tuesday's loss, it never came as the Rockies collected just four singles.\n\nThe issues are multiple, and the solutions are, too. Catching the heat would be a good start.\n\nKris Bryant battling long-term issues, but inching toward a return. Kris Bryant's back issues are a recurring problem, but the veteran hit in the cages on Wednesday, fielded, and ran in his process to come back from the injured list. He was placed on it on April 17 with a lower back strain.\n\nBlack indicated that his return will \"most likely\" come after a rehab assignment. Nolan Jones is expected to resume baseball activities this weekend, too.\n\nThe injury came after he dove into the right-field wall of Toronto's Rogers Centre. The back injury had crept up earlier in the year on the team's trip to Chicago but was exacerbated by the catch at the wall. It's a long-term issue Bryant told reporters, and stems from aging discs in his back.\n\nBryant is in the third year of a seven-year, $182 million contract and has played in 13 games this year. In his three seasons with Colorado, he has missed 226 games since signing the deal.\n\nHe struggled mightily in limited action to a .149 average and one home run in 47 at-bats.\n\nGiants 8, Rockies 6\n\nWhat happened: San Francisco blitzed Peter Lambert and put seven runs on the board before the fourth inning to upend Colorado and continue the club's franchise-worst streak without a series win to start 2024 (12).\n\nOn the mound: Lambert allowed seven earned runs on nine hits in three innings before being pulled. The Giants hung six on his line in the second inning, and he's allowed at least four earned runs in three of his last four starts. Anthony Molina did the opposite and threw 3\u2154 innings with one earned run. He's allowed two across his last 11\u2153 innings.\n\nAt the plate: Charlie Blackmon broke his 7-for-57 slump with his first multi-hit game since April 8. His two runs driven in tied Nolan Arenado for fourth in franchise history (760). Elias D\u00edaz hit his third home run in the ninth inning. Sean Bouchard had a season-high three hits. Jordan Beck had his first two hits at Coors Field after he debuted on the road.\n\nWhat's next: San Francisco Giants (RHP Keaton Winn, 3-4) at Colorado Rockies (RHP Cal Quantrill, 1-3) at 1:10 p.m. on Thursday at Coors Field (Rockies.TV).", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_zahlmann_luke_zahlmann@gazette.com",

The 11th-year veteran is off to a slow start in his debut season with the Giants, having totaled five home runs with just eight RBI and a .202 batting average, .294 on-base percentage and .361 slugging percentage.\n\nHe has just three hits in his past 10 games (35 at-bats).\n\nAfter beating the Rockies 5-0 on Monday behind Kyle Harrison's seven shutout innings, the Giants will send out Jordan Hicks (2-1) today for his eighth start this season, matching his career total prior to this season (all came with the 2022 Cardinals).

Ryan McMahon (single), Elias Diaz (double), Sean Bouchard (double), Brendan Rodgers (single) and Brenton Doyle (three-run homer) all followed, tagging Winn's pitches to all areas of the field while racking up a 6-1 lead.\n\nWinn finally got a couple outs after that before Charlie Blackmon tripled, extending the inning and forcing Winn's exit that was a handful of batters overdue.\n\nWith the Rockies batted around, Randy Rodr\u00edguez came on to face Tovar, who promptly laced a first-pitch fastball to left for a double that scored Blackmon.\n\nThat extra point extended the home team advantage to 7-1, and also made Tovar just the second player in franchise history to double and triple in the same inning. Tovar joined Garrett Hampson in that feat, as Hampson did it on Aug. 11, 2020, in the eighth inning of a win over Arizona in Denver.\n\nAs the Colorado offense broke out -- the Rockies' previous high for runs in an inning in 2024 came on April 25 against San Diego when they scored sixth in the eighth in a comeback win -- Cal Quantrill turned in his fifth quality start in his last six outings.\n\nThe right-hander pitched six innings, allowing one run on five hits and three walks. The lone blemish came in the fourth inning when Michael Conforto led off with an oppo-homer down the left field line.\n\nBesides that, Quantrill was effective, inducing eight ground-ball outs while also striking out five.\n\nAfter Colorado's explosive fourth, the Rockies added another run in the sixth via Blackmon's RBI double. That gave Chuck Nazty his 761st career RBI, moving him past Nolan Arenado into sole possession of fourth place on the Rockies' all-time list. Blackmon padded that tally with another RBI in the eighth off Littleton native Taylor Rogers, a single that scored Doyle and pushed the tally to 9-1.\n\nRookie left fielder Jordan Beck, who is struggling with a .156 average since debuting on April 30 in Miami, was the only Colorado player who didn't have a hit on Thursday as Colorado racked up 14 knocks overall.", "source": {"uri":

His ERA had gotten up to 5.00 after five starts. Understandable for a rookie, but things have turned around for him in his last few outings.\n\nIn his last three games, he's given up just one run over 18 innings of work with 16 strikeouts.

He has a very efficient fastball but is searching for another dominant pitch in his mix.\n\nHis breakout is much-needed as San Francisco rounds out their rotation. The injured Blake Snell has not lived up to expectations, which really threw their plans into wack.\n\nEntering the day, the Giants' starting pitchers were ranked 19th in ERA, 20th in WHIP and 17th in WAR.

BetMGM is one of several leading sportsbooks that accept credit card and PayPal.\n\nSan Francisco Giants at Colorado Rockies Best Bets\n\nThe Giants don't have an imposing lineup and losing Jorge Soler (shoulder) doesn't help matters. However, a series at Coors Field can cure any ailments in the run-scoring department. They scored five runs in the series opener Tuesday, all of which came within the first seven innings. They had scored seven runs by the end of the third inning Wednesday, finishing with eight total runs for the game.\n\nTaking the mound for the Rockies in this matchup will be Cal Quantrill, who has a 4.31 ERA and a 5.02 FIP this season. He has a 17.6 percent strikeout rate for his career, so his lack of swing-and-miss stuff is a major concern at Coors Field. Look for the Giants to score early and often again.\n\nBaseball fans present in the Tar Heel State can claim thousands of dollars in bonuses with North Carolina betting promos this baseball season now that North Carolina sports betting is officially live. The Caesars Sportsbook North Carolina promo code gets new customers $250 in bonus bets after making an initial wager of at least $10.\n\nMLB Picks for Giants at Rockies\n\nNew York Yankees vs. Houston Astros Best Bets\n\nRonel Blanco has been a pleasant surprise for the Astros with his 2.09 ERA. However, his 3.96 FIP isn't nearly as impressive. He has certainly been aided by his .179 BABIP allowed. Don't expect things to go as smoothly for him against Juan Soto, who is one of the hottest hitters in baseball. Over his last 14 games, he is 20-for-54 (.370) with four home runs, 13 RBI and 11 runs scored. Aaron Judge has also started to heat up, which should afford Soto with even more opportunities to score runs. Let's attack the over on Soto's combined hits, runs and RBI prop.\n\nTaking the mound for the Yankees will be Marcus Stroman, who has a disappointing 1.43 WHIP. His main problem has been a 12.4 percent walk rate. He already has three starts this season in which he has issued at least four walks. His lack of command could be especially troublesome against Kyle Tucker, who has an excellent eye at the plate. Tucker has drawn at least one walk in seven of his last 11 games. For the season, he has a 15.6 percent walk rate. That comes on the heels of his 11.9 percent walk rate last year.", "source": {"uri": "rotowire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RotoWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_barner@rotowire.com", "name": "Mike Barner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Soler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Soler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_independent_pitching_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defense independent pitching statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Tar Heels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gregory Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stroman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stroman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_on_balls_in_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average on balls in play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/hss5dlgkaii5ukagfsfn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Being next in line for a legend, not replacing one because that's almost always an impossible ask, is a pressurized situation where fans aren't just peeled to you with their eyes but can feel your pain.\n\nThat's the lane Joey Bart first was thrust into before time ran out and Bailey was next to be thrown into traffic. Bailey has been handed some bumps in the road, like his latest trip to the 10-day injured list for a concussion, but when healthy he's on the straightaway to stardom.\n\nAlong the way there have been those at the position who have stopped by. Think about Curt Casali. Remember Austin Wynns. They're not at, or near, the top of the list when recalling Giants catchers.\n\nBlake Sabol finds himself in a similar spot, and so far he's making a name for himself in his latest opportunity.\n\nThe Giants called Sabol up Saturday to be a backup to Tom Murphy, San Francisco's newest catcher to stop along this road, which also was after Bailey went down the day prior to a concussion sustained from a foul tip off his mask.\n\nSabol was thrust into action earlier than expected when Murphy went down to a knee injury in Philadelphia's wet conditions, the day of Sabol's arrival from Triple-A Sacramento. Sabol entered the game in the second inning and ended it as one of only two Giants to have multiple hits in their 14-3 loss, going 2-for-3 with two singles.\n\nSabol on Wednesday, in San Francisco's 8-6 win against the Colorado Rockies, was one of five Giants to have multiple hits. This one had special meaning for Sabol, too. The 26-year-old enjoyed his first career three-hit game.\n\nAnd it started with a strikeout in the Giants' six-run second inning.\n\nHis response was an RBI double to the left-center field gap, scoring Mike Yastrzemski to give the Giants a 7-1 lead on a day where they'd need as much cushion as possible.\n\n\"Staying in a big part of the park, not trying to do too much - a lot of times here you can think a little bit too pull-happy and try and hit homers here,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said to reporters after the win. \"Keeps it in the air when you hit it the other way and one ball he hits between first and second.\"\n\nThe switch-hitting catcher then took an off-speed pitch the other way again in his next at-bat, then pulling a hard grounder past the right side of the infield and into right field his last time at the dish.\n\nIn the four games he has played since being called up, Sabol now has two multi-hit games. He has gone 6-for-12 (.500) at the plate, going 5-for-9 off right-handers with one double and one RBI, and 1-for-3 against lefties.\n\n\"I'm just trying to let the ball come to me a little bit,\" Sabol said on \"Giants Postgame Live.\" \"The coaching staff both in Triple-A have done a great job of getting me back on track. I feel like I'm just letting the ball get over the zone and not missing right now.\"\n\nSabol actually served as the Giants' Opening Day starting catcher last season. The former seventh-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh Pirates played 110 games in total for the Giants in 2023, at three different positions. Sabol caught 55 games (starting in 46), played 43 in left field (32 as a starter) and was the Giants' DH in 10 games (eight in the starting lineup).\n\nBailey undoubtedly was going to be the Giants' everyday catcher this season. They signed Murphy to a two-year, $8.25 million contract over the offseason and still had Bart's situation to figure out before releasing him four games into the season and then trading him to the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nYet the utility man Sabol made sure his defense in catcher's gear was a main priority in the offseason and in Sacramento.\n\n\"It started first day after the season ended,\" Sabol said about focusing on his defense as a catcher. \"The biggest thing I wanted to improve this year was definitely blocking, just keeping the ball in front of me and keeping that run on third base.\n\n\"It's great to see the fruits of my labor so far, but there's been a lot of coaches that have helped me this offseason, spring training and down there in Triple-A. I think it's awesome just seeing all this effort paying off.\"\n\nThe Giants acquired Sabol from the Cincinnati Reds for a player to be named later (Jake Wong) and cash in December 2022. He doesn't have to be Bailey, he isn't in line to be the next Posey.\n\nThat isn't needed from Sabol. Words still deserve to be written for the catchers who drive down his road too, and his second act has called for more attention, and maybe more typing on this keyboard in the future.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Wynns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin Wynns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curt_Casali", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curt Casali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Posey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buster Posey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Yastrzemski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Yastrzemski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_tip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foul tip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Melvin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Melvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_to_be_named_later", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player to be named later"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/0d887a9213716141088fff2d82120c0a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The Rockies jumped all over Winn to wake their bats up in the fourth inning. Winn lasted 3 2/3 innings, giving up seven earned runs on eight hits and only struck out one batter.\n\nA game after the Giants (17-22) had five players enjoy a multi-hit day, including two who had a three-hit game, only two produced a multi-hit game. Five Giants starters were without a hit.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Giants failing to sweep the Rockies (9-28).\n\nSix batters, six hits, six runs and no outs. That's how the first 10 pitches of the fourth inning went for Winn.\n\nOnly four Rockies came to the plate in the bottom of the first inning before back-to-back 1-2-3 innings by Winn. The fourth was different. Much, much different.\n\nWithin the first three pitches of the bottom half of the fourth, the Rockies already had tied the game at 1-1 off a leadoff triple and RBI single. That was followed by two straight RBI doubles, a single and a three-run homer launched 430 feet by Brenton Doyle to put the Rockies ahead 6-1 in a blink.\n\nWinn faced three more batters in the inning, first forcing a pop out and flyout. Charlie Blackmon forced Giants manager Bob Melvin to turn to the bullpen after a 370-foot triple to center field. In total, the Rockies sent 11 batters up in the fourth inning, collecting eight hits and six that went for extra bases. Winn in his last two starts now has lasted 4 \u2153 innings, allowing 12 hits and 12 earned runs.\n\nEven in a season where Matt Chapman has uncharacteristically made a few errors early on, it's always a concern defensively when he's not at third base. Thursday marked just the second time Chapman was given a rest, giving Wilmer Flores his second try at the hot corner. He passed his first test, and did so again in his second chance.\n\nBetween the end of the second inning and all of the third inning, Flores was a magnet at the hot corner.\n\nThat's not an exaggeration either. Flores recorded four straight outs for the Giants. He did so fielding grounders to his left, to his backhand side and even snagged a line drive too. One of the hardest hit balls of the day was a Elehuris Montero groundout to Flores to begin the bottom of the third, an out that had a 105.8-mph exit velocity.\n\nFlores' struggles at the plate continued, going 0-for-4, but he was a cool customer manning the third-base line.\n\nThe fourth inning clearly was a hole the Giants couldn't climb out of. They also didn't do themselves any favors in a few different cases.\n\nEstrada had the Giants' lone hit of the first inning, but he also ran into the third out at third base. The Giants' second baseman slid over third base trying to steal on a 2-2 count and ball three being way outside to Mike Yastrzemski. He tried to get back in time but was tagged out by third baseman Ryan McMahon.\n\nThen in the top of the fourth, an inning that began with a Michael Conforto solo shot, Blake Sabol turned to bunt a ball below the strike zone to get him in an 0-2 hole. The Giants at the time held a 1-0 lead, had a runner at first base and two outs. Sabol eventually worked an impressive six-pitch walk, but the next batter also had a head-scratching bunt attempt.\n\nNow with a runner in scoring position and two outs, Tyler Fitzgerald squared to bunt the first pitch he saw, a pitch way up and in that should have been a ball. Fitzgerald ultimately struck out on three pitches to end the inning. The Rockies countered with seven runs in the bottom half.\n\nSmart baseball always is required, even against the Rockies.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Bay Area & California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer_Flores", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilmer Flores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Chapman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Chapman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Melvin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Melvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elehuris_Montero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elehuris Montero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Yastrzemski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Yastrzemski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McMahon (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Conforto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Conforto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tag out"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2024/05/Keaton-Winn-Rockies-USATSI.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548244", "eventUri": "eng-9548244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 452988198, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 64, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 64}}}

David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nDENVER -- Ezequiel Tovar had a triple and double and Brenton Doyle hit a three-run homer in a seven-run outburst in the fourth inning as the Colorado Rockies snapped a four-game skid with a 9-1 win over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nColorado, which entered the game with the worst record in the majors, won for just the ninth time and avoided being swept for the fourth time this season.\n\nCharlie Blackmon drove in two runs and finished a homer shy of hitting for the cycle for Colorado. The 37-year-old Blackmon has 762 career RBI, fourth on Colorado's franchise list.\n\nMichael Conforto gave San Francisco a 1-0 lead with a solo homer in the top of the fourth before Colorado jumped on starter Keaton Winn (3-5). Tovar tripled to lead off the inning and the Rockies reeled off six straight hits, capped by Doyle's 430-foot homer to center, his fourth of the season.\n\nWinn got two outs, and then Blackmon tripled and Tovar doubled off of reliever Randy Rodriguez. The Rockies sent 11 batters to the plate in the fourth and tagged Winn for seven runs on eight hits in 3 2/3 innings.\n\nTovar is the second player in franchise history to have a triple and double in the same inning. Garrett Hampson did it against Arizona on Aug. 11, 2020.\n\nCal Quantrill (2-3) worked six innings for his second consecutive strong outing. The 29-year-old right-hander pitched 7 2/3 shutout innings at Pittsburgh on Friday and has allowed one run in his last two starts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDIAMONDBACKS 5, REDS 4: Slade Cecconi pitched 5 1/3 innings of one-run ball, Corbin Carroll drove in the winning run with an eighth-inning single and visiting Arizona capped a series sweep and extended the Reds' losing skid to eight games.\n\nJoc Pederson homered in the first inning for Arizona, which won its fourth straight. Five players drove in runs.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE\n\nTWINS 11, MARINERS 1: Manny Margot highlighted a five-run first inning for host Minnesota with a three-run double off Seattle ace Logan Gilbert, and the Twins coasted to win their fifth consecutive series.\n\nPablo L\u00f3pez (4-2) pitched into the seventh with a season-high 10 strikeouts to win his third straight start. Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler each homered and drove in two runs, Jose Miranda scored three runs on two hits and Margot matched his career high with five RBI for the Twins, who won for the 15th time in their last 17 games.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nDENVER -- Ezequiel Tovar had a triple and double and Brenton Doyle hit a three-run homer in a seven-run outburst in the fourth inning as the Colorado Rockies snapped a four-game skid with a 9-1 win over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nColorado, which entered the game with the worst record in the majors, won for just the ninth time and avoided being swept for the fourth time this season.\n\nCharlie Blackmon drove in two runs and finished a homer shy of hitting for the cycle for Colorado. The 37-year-old Blackmon has 762 career RBI, fourth on Colorado's franchise list.\n\nMichael Conforto gave San Francisco a 1-0 lead with a solo homer in the top of the fourth before Colorado jumped on starter Keaton Winn (3-5). Tovar tripled to lead off the inning and the Rockies reeled off six straight hits, capped by Doyle's 430-foot homer to center, his fourth of the season.\n\nWinn got two outs, and then Blackmon tripled and Tovar doubled off of reliever Randy Rodriguez. The Rockies sent 11 batters to the plate in the fourth and tagged Winn for seven runs on eight hits in 3 2/3 innings.\n\nTovar is the second player in franchise history to have a triple and double in the same inning. Garrett Hampson did it against Arizona on Aug. 11, 2020.\n\nCal Quantrill (2-3) worked six innings for his second consecutive strong outing. The 29-year-old right-hander pitched 7 2/3 shutout innings at Pittsburgh on Friday and has allowed one run in his last two starts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDIAMONDBACKS 5, REDS 4: Slade Cecconi pitched 5 1/3 innings of one-run ball, Corbin Carroll drove in the winning run with an eighth-inning single and visiting Arizona capped a series sweep and extended the Reds' losing skid to eight games.\n\nJoc Pederson homered in the first inning for Arizona, which won its fourth straight. Five players drove in runs.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE\n\nTWINS 11, MARINERS 1: Manny Margot highlighted a five-run first inning for host Minnesota with a three-run double off Seattle ace Logan Gilbert, and the Twins coasted to win their fifth consecutive series.\n\nPablo L\u00f3pez (4-2) pitched into the seventh with a season-high 10 strikeouts to win his third straight start. Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler each homered and drove in two runs, Jose Miranda scored three runs on two hits and Margot matched his career high with five RBI for the Twins, who won for the 15th time in their last 17 games.\n\nNOTES\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTRADES: The Atlanta Braves acquired utility infielder Zack Short from the Boston Red Sox after dealing infielder Luis Guillorme to the Los Angeles Angels, each for cash.\n\nGuillorme started in five games at second base and one game at shortstop for the Braves and also pitched one inning in relief this season before he was sent to the Angels. Guillorme, 29, hit .150 in 20 at-bats.\n\nGuillorme played for the New York Mets from 2018-23. He has a .258 career batting average.\n\nShort, 28, was designated for assignment by the Red Sox on Wednesday before being acquired by the Braves for cash. Short had no hits in seven at-bats for Boston after being acquired from the Mets, also for cash, on May 1. He was designated for assignment by the Mets on April 26.\n\nShort has played at second base, third base and shortstop this season. Short has a .177 average with 13 homers, 55 RBI and eight stolen bases in 189 games with Detroit (2021-23) and the Mets.\n\nTV: Lionsgate Television is developing a scripted series based on the real-life gambling scandal involving Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani's interpreter.\n\nThe show will follow Ohtani's story -- his meteoric rise in the MLB, his 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers and then the devastating news that his interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, had allegedly stolen $17 million from him to pay off gambling debts.\n\nThe series will be produced by Tony Award winner Scott Delman, known for \"The Book of Mormon\" and \"Raisin in the Sun,\" and sports journalist Albert Chen, Santa Monica-based Lionsgate said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

It was their most fruitful offensive inning of the year and produced season-best and historic marks for multiple hitters.\n\nColorado hasn't won a series in 12 attempts this season after dropping the first two games, further extending their franchise-worst milestone. The series also dropped the Rockies to the worst record in the majors and made their start to 2024 an even more historic mark for the organization.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the losing series, and the moments that mattered most:\n\nThe Moment\n\nColorado's momentum was nonexistent when Ezequiel Tovar stepped to the plate to lead off the fourth inning on Thursday.\n\nHis triple started a seven-run inning to force San Francisco starter Keaton Winn out of the game after just 51 pitches. Ryan McMahon drove in Tovar on the next pitch as part of Colorado's season-high six consecutive hits to take a 7-1 lead.\n\nBrenton Doyle's home run on a hanging splitter amplified the damage after the hit streak and represented his first since April 13 as part of a breakout offensive season.\n\nFouling off good pitches, and whiffing through balls outside the zone has plagued the Rockies offense. San Francisco was exposed to the opposite side of that token Thursday.\n\n\"Get a good pitch to hit and don't miss it,\" manager Bud Black said. \"We didn't miss the pitch today.\"\n\nColorado had eight hitters reach base and four did so multiple times in the offensive outburst.\n\nTakeaway\n\nColorado rolls when Charlie Blackmon and Ezequiel Tovar do, especially when the two are at the top of the lineup.\n\nBlackmon was in a slump entering the three-game set with the Giants and pressing to be aggressive through it. The result was a 5-for-9 stretch in back-to-back games atop the Rockies lineup and a slump-busting week for the veteran.\n\nTovar has struggled in recent games too, but on Thursday he became the second Colorado hitter in its history to have multiple extra-base hits in one inning thanks to a triple and double in the fourth. His average was up to .321 on April 21 before falling to .257 entering the San Francisco series.\n\nWhen the two find success atop the lineup, it becomes contagious.\n\n\"We've talked about the contagious factor of hitting,\" Black said. \"We had a decent game yesterday, we made a charge at them late. Today it sort of carried over. We need the guys to swing like that swung the bat today.\"\n\nWhat went right:\n\nAnthony Molina's relief role has taken a turn for the better and may earn him a greater future opportunity.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Since then, he's allowed one in 12\u2153 innings and zero in his last six chances. Peter Lambert and Ty Blach have each split time between the bullpen and rotation, and the same mix could be in Molina's future after being selected in the Rule 5 draft by Colorado this offseason.\n\n\"He was a minor league starter just like Peter,\" Black said after Wednesday's 8-6 loss. \"He's 22 years old, he's young. We're trying to break him in.\n\n\"So far so good as far as how he's been able to handle the major leagues as far as everything he's been exposed to.\"\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nPeter Lambert's re-entry into the rotation hasn't gone smoothly in 2024.\n\nHe found a quick rhythm in 2023 and became one of the team's more consistent starters. Wednesday, he fell prey to his worst start since 2019. Lambert allowed a season-high seven earned runs on nine hits in three innings. It was the highest allowance since his Aug. 17, 2019 start against Houston in which he allowed nine runs.\n\nDamage came after an 11-pitch first inning without a base runner.\n\n\"It just kind of turned pretty quickly,\" Lambert said. \"I thought I made some pretty good pitches, made some bad pitches obviously, and they seemed to put the bat on the ball on the good pitches and take advantage of the bad pitches.\"\n\nThe six-run second inning started early. Michael Conforto hit a leadoff home run on a first-pitch fastball. The Giants lined three consecutive singles before they used a safety squeeze bunt play to score another run. Jung Hoo Lee's double and LaMonte Wade Jr.'s single scored three more.\n\nHe has three starts since subbing for Kyle Freeland and a 16.39 ERA in that role through 9\u2153 innings.\n\nWhat's up next\n\nColorado hosts defending MLB champion Texas Rangers for a three-game set and will see an old friend over the weekend.\n\nJon Gray is slated to face his former club for the second time on Friday. He threw five innings against them in 2023 and allowed one earned run in a Rangers' win. The former Rockies' starter left in free agency in 2021 after seven years and a 4.59 ERA with them.\n\nRockies 9, Giants 1\n\nWhat happened: Colorado had its best offensive inning of the year in the fourth frame and used six consecutive hits and seven runs to earn a lopsided win over the Giants on Thursday and avoid a series sweep.\n\nOn the mound: Cal Quantrill got some much-needed run support and returned the favor. He threw six innings and allowed five hits and an earned run with five strikeouts. His ERA is down to 3.94. Victor Vodnik and Jalen Beeks had similar success and combined for three scoreless innings and a pair of strikeouts.\n\nAt the plate: Ezequiel Tovar started the seven-run fourth inning with a triple as part of his three hits.

It was their most fruitful offensive inning of the year and produced season-best and historic marks for multiple hitters.\n\nColorado hasn't won a series in 12 attempts this season after dropping the first two games, further extending their franchise-worst milestone. The series also dropped the Rockies to the worst record in the majors and made their start to 2024 an even more historic mark for the organization.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the losing series, and the moments that mattered most:\n\nThe Moment\n\nColorado's momentum was nonexistent when Ezequiel Tovar stepped to the plate to lead off the fourth inning on Thursday.\n\nHis triple started a seven-run inning to force San Francisco starter Keaton Winn out of the game after just 51 pitches. Ryan McMahon drove in Tovar on the next pitch as part of Colorado's season-high six consecutive hits to take a 7-1 lead.\n\nBrenton Doyle's home run on a hanging splitter amplified the damage after the hit streak and represented his first since April 13 as part of a breakout offensive season.\n\nFouling off good pitches, and whiffing through balls outside the zone has plagued the Rockies offense. San Francisco was exposed to the opposite side of that token Thursday.\n\n\"Get a good pitch to hit and don't miss it,\" manager Bud Black said. \"We didn't miss the pitch today.\"\n\nColorado had eight hitters reach base and four did so multiple times in the offensive outburst.\n\nTakeaway\n\nColorado rolls when Charlie Blackmon and Ezequiel Tovar do, especially when the two are at the top of the lineup.\n\nBlackmon was in a slump entering the three-game set with the Giants and pressing to be aggressive through it. The result was a 5-for-9 stretch in back-to-back games atop the Rockies lineup and a slump-busting week for the veteran.\n\nTovar has struggled in recent games too, but on Thursday he became the second Colorado hitter in its history to have multiple extra-base hits in one inning thanks to a triple and double in the fourth. His average was up to .321 on April 21 before falling to .257 entering the San Francisco series.\n\nWhen the two find success atop the lineup, it becomes contagious.\n\n\"We've talked about the contagious factor of hitting,\" Black said. \"We had a decent game yesterday, we made a charge at them late. Today it sort of carried over. We need the guys to swing like that swung the bat today.\"\n\nWhat went right:\n\nAnthony Molina's relief role has taken a turn for the better and may earn him a greater future opportunity.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Since then, he's allowed one in 12\u2153 innings and zero in his last six chances. Peter Lambert and Ty Blach have each split time between the bullpen and rotation, and the same mix could be in Molina's future after being selected in the Rule 5 draft by Colorado this offseason.\n\n\"He was a minor league starter just like Peter,\" Black said after Wednesday's 8-6 loss. \"He's 22 years old, he's young. We're trying to break him in.\n\n\"So far so good as far as how he's been able to handle the major leagues as far as everything he's been exposed to.\"\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nPeter Lambert's re-entry into the rotation hasn't gone smoothly in 2024.\n\nHe found a quick rhythm in 2023 and became one of the team's more consistent starters. Wednesday, he fell prey to his worst start since 2019. Lambert allowed a season-high seven earned runs on nine hits in three innings. It was the highest allowance since his Aug. 17, 2019 start against Houston in which he allowed nine runs.\n\nDamage came after an 11-pitch first inning without a base runner.\n\n\"It just kind of turned pretty quickly,\" Lambert said. \"I thought I made some pretty good pitches, made some bad pitches obviously, and they seemed to put the bat on the ball on the good pitches and take advantage of the bad pitches.\"\n\nThe six-run second inning started early. Michael Conforto hit a leadoff home run on a first-pitch fastball. The Giants lined three consecutive singles before they used a safety squeeze bunt play to score another run. Jung Hoo Lee's double and LaMonte Wade Jr.'s single scored three more.\n\nHe has three starts since subbing for Kyle Freeland and a 16.39 ERA in that role through 9\u2153 innings.\n\nWhat's up next\n\nColorado hosts defending MLB champion Texas Rangers for a three-game set and will see an old friend over the weekend.\n\nJon Gray is slated to face his former club for the second time on Friday. He threw five innings against them in 2023 and allowed one earned run in a Rangers' win. The former Rockies' starter left in free agency in 2021 after seven years and a 4.59 ERA with them.\n\nRockies 9, Giants 1\n\nWhat happened: Colorado had its best offensive inning of the year in the fourth frame and used six consecutive hits and seven runs to earn a lopsided win over the Giants on Thursday and avoid a series sweep.\n\nOn the mound: Cal Quantrill got some much-needed run support and returned the favor. He threw six innings and allowed five hits and an earned run with five strikeouts. His ERA is down to 3.94. Victor Vodnik and Jalen Beeks had similar success and combined for three scoreless innings and a pair of strikeouts.\n\nAt the plate: Ezequiel Tovar started the seven-run fourth inning with a triple as part of his three hits. Charlie Blackmon also tripled and had three hits, and his two runs driven in pushed him past Nolan Arenado for fourth in Colorado history. Brenton Doyle's blow loomed largest and his three-run home run put an exclamation point on his two-hit day and the Rockies' blowup inning. Their 14 hits were tied for the second-most in a game this year.\n\nWhat's next: Texas Rangers (RHP Jon Gray, 1-1) at Colorado Rockies (LHP Austin Gomber, 0-2) at 6:40 p.m. on Friday at Coors Field

We know one of the Rogers twins is going to come in when it's a high-leverage situation.\n\nBut the Giants have their fireman in the pen. His name is Ryan Walker.\n\nOver his last 10 innings of action -- 10 games -- Walker, a herky-jerky righty with a cross-body delivery, has allowed only three hits and no runs, while striking out 18.\n\nHe's cooking, and if the Giants find themselves in a position to win a game after even five innings, they have to like their chances of finishing off the game.\n\nAnd, one quick note: Randy Rodriguez, who saw his first big-league action on this trip, looks like he stands a chance of being an impact arm for the Giants. Sure, 99 miles per hour is par for the course in baseball these days, but I'm still impressed.\n\nDOWN: The Giants' good health\n\nAt least when it came to position players, the Giants were in good health heading into this 10-game road trip.\n\nThat is no longer the case. Jorge Soler is on the injured list, as are both of their catchers, and Nick Ahmed and Jung Hoo Lee both picked up knocks in Colorado.\n\nThe Giants' lineup depth is being tested and it will continue to be tested.\n\nPerhaps that's a good thing, given this team's offensive struggles -- it's a forced mix-up.\n\nOr perhaps a bad offense is about to become worse, as not-everyday players are thrust into those roles.\n\nUP: Thairo Estrada\n\nThe Giants second baseman had a brutal start to the season, but he's back to being himself, and that's a damn fine baseball player.\n\nEstrada slashed .282/.333/.410 on the 10-game road trip, playing every day and hitting two doubles and a homer, driving in seven runs.\n\nOn an offense with few bright spots these days, he's unquestionably a positive at the moment.\n\nBut what has most impressed me with Estrada as of late is his glove. He's really flashing the leather at second.\n\nThe eye test is flattering. The tracking data is enviable. Estrada is third in baseball with five outs above average at second base.\n\nAnd while, yes, he did lead all second basemen in that category last year, the combination of that glove with the Giants' left side of the infield seems like a huge advantage over the competition.\n\nWith Nick Ahmed (baseball's second-best defensive shortstop this season, per Fielding Run-Value), the incomparable Matt Chapman, and Estrada all playing Gold Glove-level defense, the Giants should be begging their pitchers to induce ground balls all game.\n\nIf nothing else, that would get this all over with sooner.\n\nDOWN: Keaton Winn\n\nThe young starter has the stuff to be a big-league pitcher.\n\nBut when he isn't locating, things escalate in a hurry. (And not in a good way for the Giants.)\n\nYou want to give the 26-year-old the benefit of the doubt for what happened in Philadelphia -- he was under the weather for the game he couldn't escape the first inning, allowing five runs. Anything less than your best against the Phillies will be burned.\n\nAnd sure, Coors Field is a tough place to pitch, but the Rockies are not a lineup to be feared. Yet after the first time through the order, Colorado jumped on Winn early in the count and tagged him for seven runs on eight hits.\n\nThe Giants aren't in a position to knock Winn out of the rotation right now, but he'll probably have one more start to prove he deserves to be in it. After that Blake Snell is likely to return and Mason Black will have a second big-league start under his belt.\n\nThat start is likely to come next Tuesday against the...

We know one of the Rogers twins is going to come in when it's a high-leverage situation.\n\nBut the Giants have their fireman in the pen. His name is Ryan Walker.\n\nOver his last 10 innings of action -- 10 games -- Walker, a herky-jerky righty with a cross-body delivery, has allowed only three hits and no runs, while striking out 18.\n\nHe's cooking, and if the Giants find themselves in a position to win a game after even five innings, they have to like their chances of finishing off the game.\n\nAnd, one quick note: Randy Rodriguez, who saw his first big-league action on this trip, looks like he stands a chance of being an impact arm for the Giants. Sure, 99 miles per hour is par for the course in baseball these days, but I'm still impressed.\n\nDOWN: The Giants' good health\n\nAt least when it came to position players, the Giants were in good health heading into this 10-game road trip.\n\nThat is no longer the case. Jorge Soler is on the injured list, as are both of their catchers, and Nick Ahmed and Jung Hoo Lee both picked up knocks in Colorado.\n\nThe Giants' lineup depth is being tested and it will continue to be tested.\n\nPerhaps that's a good thing, given this team's offensive struggles -- it's a forced mix-up.\n\nOr perhaps a bad offense is about to become worse, as not-everyday players are thrust into those roles.\n\nUP: Thairo Estrada\n\nThe Giants second baseman had a brutal start to the season, but he's back to being himself, and that's a damn fine baseball player.\n\nEstrada slashed .282/.333/.410 on the 10-game road trip, playing every day and hitting two doubles and a homer, driving in seven runs.\n\nOn an offense with few bright spots these days, he's unquestionably a positive at the moment.\n\nBut what has most impressed me with Estrada as of late is his glove. He's really flashing the leather at second.\n\nThe eye test is flattering. The tracking data is enviable. Estrada is third in baseball with five outs above average at second base.\n\nAnd while, yes, he did lead all second basemen in that category last year, the combination of that glove with the Giants' left side of the infield seems like a huge advantage over the competition.\n\nWith Nick Ahmed (baseball's second-best defensive shortstop this season, per Fielding Run-Value), the incomparable Matt Chapman, and Estrada all playing Gold Glove-level defense, the Giants should be begging their pitchers to induce ground balls all game.\n\nIf nothing else, that would get this all over with sooner.\n\nDOWN: Keaton Winn\n\nThe young starter has the stuff to be a big-league pitcher.\n\nBut when he isn't locating, things escalate in a hurry. (And not in a good way for the Giants.)\n\nYou want to give the 26-year-old the benefit of the doubt for what happened in Philadelphia -- he was under the weather for the game he couldn't escape the first inning, allowing five runs. Anything less than your best against the Phillies will be burned.\n\nAnd sure, Coors Field is a tough place to pitch, but the Rockies are not a lineup to be feared. Yet after the first time through the order, Colorado jumped on Winn early in the count and tagged him for seven runs on eight hits.\n\nThe Giants aren't in a position to knock Winn out of the rotation right now, but he'll probably have one more start to prove he deserves to be in it. After that Blake Snell is likely to return and Mason Black will have a second big-league start under his belt.\n\nThat start is likely to come next Tuesday against the... Dodgers.\n\nHe still can't play a lick of defense, but his red-hot bat requires him to be in the lineup daily. Strangely, that makes Soler's injury a win for San Francisco -- manager Bob Melvin can stash Conforto in the DH spot, where he truly belongs.\n\nI say \"can\" because Melvin decided to play Conforto in left on Thursday, with Lee on the bench, and hit Blake Sabol in the DH spot.\n\nRegardless, Conforto is raking. On the road trip, he slashed .303/.395/.576 with two homers.\n\nConforto is never going to be the player he was for the Mets in 2020, when he was 54 percent better than a league-average hitter, but he's been roughly 30 percent better this season. For an offense starved for, well, offense, the front office's belief in the 31-year-old is looking wise.\n\nNow, if only teams could stop hitting it to him in left field.\n\nThe 3-7 road trip has put the Giants in a hole. It's hardly an insurmountable one -- the Giants were somehow only 2.5 games back of a Wild Card spot after Thursday's loss -- but it's still a hole.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that anything less than 85 wins will be enough to make the playoffs.\n\nThat means the Giants need to go 68-55 the rest of the way.\n\nCan they?

The 37-year-old Blackmon has 762 career RBIs, fourth on Colorado's franchise list.\n\nMichael Conforto gave San Francisco a 1-0 lead with a solo homer in the top of the fourth before Colorado jumped on starter Keaton Winn (3-5). Tovar tripled to lead off the inning and the Rockies reeled off six straight hits, capped by Doyle's 430-foot homer to center, his fourth of the season.\n\nWinn got two outs, and then Blackmon tripled and Tovar doubled off of reliever Randy Rodriguez. The Rockies sent 11 batters to the plate in the fourth and tagged Winn for seven runs on eight hits in 3 2/3 innings.\n\n\"Winn got some pitches up and we took advantage, finally, of some mistakes and barreled balls,\" manager Bud Black said.\n\nRelated Story: Harper Homers, Wheeler Strikes out 11 as Phillies Complete Sweep of Reeling ...\n\nTovar is the second player in franchise history to have a triple and double in the same inning. Garrett Hampson did it against Arizona on Aug. 11, 2020.\n\nCal Quantrill (2-3) worked six innings for his second consecutive strong outing. The 29-year-old right-hander pitched 7 2/3 shutout innings at Pittsburgh on Friday and has allowed one run in his last two starts.\n\nRelated Story: Slumping Giants Fall Again to Red-Hot Phillies. Rookie Gets Start for SF Today.\n\n\"It's a lot more fun pitching with a six-run lead,\" Quantrill said. \"I want to win when I pitch.\"\n\nSan Francisco shortstop Nick Ahmed left the game in the fourth inning when he aggravated a sore left wrist in his at-bat in the third.\n\n\"It's the same wrist he got hit on by the line drive,\" manager Bob Melvin said. \"It's been bothering him off and on a little bit, but obviously affected him quite a bit on that swing. We'll get a look at him.\"\n\nGiants: OF Jung Hoo Lee was out of the lineup after fouling a ball off of his foot Wednesday night. \"He's sore enough to leave him out. We'll see how he responds to treatment over the course of today and where we go from here,\" Melvin said.\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland played catch Thursday and will continue to build up, Black said. Freeland (left elbow strain) went on the IL on April 16.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name":
